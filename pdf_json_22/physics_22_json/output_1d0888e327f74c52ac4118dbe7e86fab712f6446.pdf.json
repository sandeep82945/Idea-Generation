This endows these two quantities with fundamental operational interpretations in quantum state discrimination. Our findings extend to composite hypothesis testing, where we show that the asymmetric error exponent with respect to any convex set of density matrices is given by a regularisation of the Hilbert projective metric. We apply our results also to quantum channels, showing that no advantage is gained by employing adaptive or even more general discrimination schemes over parallel ones, in both the asymmetric and symmetric settings. Our state discrimination results make use of no properties specific to quantum mechanics and are also valid in general probabilistic theories.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA. Background\nQuantum hypothesis testing \u2014 a generalisation of the crucial statistical primitive of hypothesis testing to the non-commutative setting \u2014 is a fundamental task that directly underlies many protocols in quantum information science [1\u20133]. It is concerned with the problem of distinguishing different quantum states or channels, and in particular asks about the ultimate limits of such distinguishability.\nIn quantum state discrimination, after receiving one of two possible states, \ud835\udf0c (null hypothesis) or \ud835\udf0e (alternative hypothesis), one aims to determine which of the two was actually obtained. This is typically done by performing a quantum measurement, or positive operator-valued measure (POVM), given by the tuple \ud835\udc40 B {\ud835\udc401 , \ud835\udc402} where \ud835\udc402 = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc401. If measurement outcome 1 is obtained (corresponding to the operator \ud835\udc401), one guesses that the state is \ud835\udf0c; if outcome 2 is obtained, one guesses \ud835\udf0e. There are then two types of errors that can occur: the type I error with probability\n\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc40) B Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c, (1) \u2217 bartosz.regula@gmail.com \u2020 ludovico.lami@gmail.com \u2021 wilde@cornell.edu\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n10 55\n0v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n9 S\nep 2\n02 3\n2 which corresponds to incorrectly guessing \ud835\udf0e when \ud835\udf0c was true (false positive), and the type II error with probability\n\ud835\udefd(\ud835\udc40) B Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e, (2) which is the case of guessing \ud835\udf0c when \ud835\udf0e was true (false negative). Two settings naturally emerge here: one is asymmetric hypothesis testing, which asks about how small one of the errors can be subject to constraints on the other error; another setting is symmetric hypothesis testing, where the two errors are treated equally and one aims to minimise their average. Specifically, the asymmetric case is concerned with the study of the optimised type II error probability\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) B min \ud835\udc40\u2208\u21332\n{ \ud835\udefd(\ud835\udc40) \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc40) \u2264 \ud835\udf00} = min \ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u22650 { Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e\n\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 = 1, Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c \u2264 \ud835\udf00} , (3) where \u21332 denotes the set of all two-outcome measurements. The symmetric error depends also on the prior probabilities associated with the two hypotheses, that is, the probability that the state to be discriminated is \ud835\udf0c or that it is \ud835\udf0e. Denoting the respective priors by \ud835\udc5d and \ud835\udc5e B 1\u2212 \ud835\udc5d, we define the symmetric error probability as\n\ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) B min \ud835\udc40\u2208\u21332\n[ \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc40) + \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udefd(\ud835\udc40) ] = min \ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u22650 { \ud835\udc5d Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c + \ud835\udc5e Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e\n\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 = 1} . (4) The two optimised error probabilities defined above are not too difficult to characterise: they are both efficiently computable semidefinite programs, and the symmetric error even admits an exact solution given by the celebrated Helstrom\u2013Holevo theorem [4, 5] in terms of the trace distance (total variation distance),\n\ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = 1 2 ( 1 \u2212 \u2225\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c \u2212 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e\u2225 1 ) , (5)\nwhere \u2225\u00b7\u2225 1 denotes the trace norm (Schatten 1-norm). However, a limitation of the above formulations is that they assume access to only a single copy of the state to be discriminated. This is not reflective of situations encountered in practice, where one typically deals with sources that emit many copies of quantum states, which we can use to our advantage in attempting to discriminate them. That is, we can assume that we receive either \ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b or \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b and then perform a joint measurement over all \ud835\udc5b systems. The crucial question then is: how exactly does the performance in discriminating two states improve when we have access to more copies of them? The ultimate limit of such protocols is described by the asymptotic setting with \ud835\udc5b \u2192 \u221e, and the figures of merit then are the decay rates of \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) and \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e), known as the error exponents. These two limits give rise to two of the most fundamental quantities in quantum information. The first one is the quantum relative entropy \ud835\udc37(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) B Tr \ud835\udf0c(log \ud835\udf0c \u2212 log \ud835\udf0e) [6], which is known to be exactly equal to the error exponent in asymmetric hypothesis testing:\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc37(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) \u2200\ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1). (6)\nThis was shown in the works of Hiai and Petz [7] (achievability and weak converse1) and Ogawa and Nagaoka [8] (strong converse). The above result, known as the quantum Stein\u2019s lemma,\n1 In the setting of asymptotic asymmetric hypothesis testing, a \u2018weak converse\u2019 for the error exponent is understood as one that holds in the limit \ud835\udf00 \u2192 0, while a \u2018strong converse\u2019 holds for every \ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1). The motivation for considering the latter is that, for every type II error exponent larger than a strong converse bound, the type I error must be prohibitively large \u2014 it must asymptotically converge to 1, making discrimination effectively impossible.\n3 generalises a seminal result due to Stein and Chernoff [9, 10]. It provides an important operational interpretation of the quantum relative entropy, and in a large part motivates its extensive use in quantum information as a quantifier of the distinguishability between two quantum states and a meaningful generalisation of the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence [11].\nAn analogous result in symmetric hypothesis testing, generalising a finding of Chernoff [12], was obtained in the works of Nussbaum and Szko\u0142a [13] (converse) and Audenaert et al. [14] (achievability), yielding\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = \ud835\udf09(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) B \u2212 log inf 0\u2264\ud835\udc60\u22641 Tr \ud835\udf0c1\u2212\ud835\udc60\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc60 \u2200\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d \u2208 (0, 1). (7)\nThis is commonly known as the quantum Chernoff bound, with the Chernoff divergence \ud835\udf09(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) constituting another important measure of distinguishability between quantum states.\nDue to the intricate mathematical methods needed to establish the quantum Stein\u2019s lemma and the quantum Chernoff bound, the results have found few generalisations. There are, for instance, important cases where the alternative hypothesis is not given simply by i.i.d. quantum states (\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b)\ud835\udc5b , but rather by a sequence (\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5b)\ud835\udc5b of states taken from some subset of density matrices \u2014 this is known as composite hypothesis testing. A generalised quantum Stein\u2019s lemma in this setting was proposed [15], but so far no valid proof of such a relation has been found [16] beyond some special cases [17, 18] or related but incomparable composite settings [16, 18\u201320].\nPerhaps even more challenging is the case of quantum channel discrimination. This task is inherently much more complex than state discrimination: any manipulation of \ud835\udc5b copies of a quantum state \ud835\udf0c is fully equivalent to having access to the tensor product \ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , while being able to invoke \ud835\udc5b uses of a channel\u2133 is not the same as manipulating \ud835\udc5b parallel copies\u2133\u2297\ud835\udc5b , since schemes for channel discrimination much more general than na\u00efve parallel protocols can be employed. A common example are the so-called adaptive protocols, which work by processing the channel \ud835\udc5b times, such that information obtained in previous rounds can be used to enhance the successive rounds of processing [21]. It is known that adaptive discrimination of channels can yield strict improvements over parallel protocols, although a very recent line of work [22\u201324] established that the advantage disappears asymptotically in asymmetric hypothesis testing, where the (weak converse) error exponent is given by the regularised channel relative entropy:\nlim \ud835\udf00\u21920 lim inf \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\u2133\u2297\ud835\udc5b ,\ud835\udca9\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc37\u221e(\u2133\u2225\ud835\udca9) B lim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \ud835\udc5b sup \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc37(id \u2297 \u2133\u2297\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225id \u2297 \ud835\udca9\u2297\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udf0c))\n= sup \ud835\udf0c,\ud835\udf14\n[ \ud835\udc37(id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf14)) \u2212 \ud835\udc37(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf14) ] . (8)\nIn symmetric hypothesis testing, it is known that adaptive strategies can improve over parallel ones both non-asymptotically and asymptotically [25, 26], although in general no exact form of the asymptotic error exponent \u2014 and thus no extension of the Chernoff bound \u2014 is known in the setting of quantum channels [27]. The landscape of channel discrimination is further complicated by the fact that there exist even more general ways of manipulating quantum channels than adaptive protocols, for instance ones without a definite causal order structure [28, 29], and they can yield strict improvements in some settings [28, 30\u201332]; the asymptotic performance of such strategies, however, has not been characterised yet.\nWe note that all definitions of this section reduce to their corresponding classical counterparts when the two states \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf0e commute (corresponding to probability distributions) and when the channels \u2133 and \ud835\udca9 are classical [33, 34].\n4 B. Setting\nIn this work, we propose a variant of quantum hypothesis testing that adds an additional, \u2018inconclusive\u2019 measurement outcome, allowing us to abstain from discriminating the states if we are not sufficiently confident in the result. This can be motivated, for instance, by an experimental situation in which a \u2018no detection\u2019 event occurs, that is, a detector responsible for distinguishing two states fails to recognise either of them. More generally, a motivation to consider such a setting could be any situation where avoiding a wrong result is of utmost importance, even if this means having to repeat the trial many times, such as would be the case e.g. with medical diagnoses.\nTo be specific, let us consider the case of quantum state discrimination. Given either of the two states \ud835\udf0c or \ud835\udf0e, we perform a three-outcome measurement \ud835\udc40 = {\ud835\udc401 , \ud835\udc402 , \ud835\udc40?}. The first two outcomes are as before \u2014 outcome 1 corresponds to the guess \u2018\ud835\udf0c\u2019 and outcome 2 corresponds to the guess \u2018\ud835\udf0e\u2019 \u2014 while the third outcome \u2018?\u2019 is designated as an inconclusive result, that is, a case in which we are unable to decisively distinguish the hypotheses. There is therefore some probability that our attempt to perform hypothesis testing fails: this probability is Tr \ud835\udc40?\ud835\udf0c when measuring \ud835\udf0c, and Tr \ud835\udc40?\ud835\udf0e when measuring \ud835\udf0e.\nSuch an approach dates back to the early works of Ivanovic [35], Dieks [36], and Peres [37], where it was shown that all linearly independent pure states can be discriminated with no error, but only through inconclusive protocols whose probability of success may be strictly less than one. Extensions of this idea were studied in a number of settings [38\u201346], but mostly restricted to non-asymptotic, symmetric state discrimination. A related class of problems was also studied in classical hypothesis testing [47, 48], although the way that discrimination errors and the consequent rates were defined there means that the setting is not directly comparable with ours.\nHere we establish a complete and rigorous formalisation of inconclusive state discrimination schemes in quantum hypothesis testing. Our approach is based on characterising the corresponding errors conditioned on a conclusive result; that is, assuming that either of the outcomes \u20181\u2019 or \u20182\u2019 was obtained, how likely is it that we made an incorrect guess? This can be understood as postselecting on a conclusive outcome of the measurement and ignoring all measurement results where the outcome \u2018?\u2019 is obtained. Depending on whether discussing the asymmetric or symmetric setting, we are concerned with the error probability when measuring a particular state \ud835\udf0c or \ud835\udf0e, or the average probability when measuring either of them.\nTo clarify how our setting differs from the conventional one of conclusive hypothesis testing, let us first consider the case of asymmetric error. Observe that the conventional type I error, for instance, is defined as \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc40) = \ud835\udc43(error | \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udc40), i.e. the probability of guessing incorrectly given that the measured state is \ud835\udf0c. In our approach here, we further condition the incorrect guess event on the attainment of a conclusive outcome. We thus define the following counterparts of the conventional hypothesis testing errors: the conditional type I error and conditional type II error probabilities are given by\n\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc40) B \ud835\udc43(error | \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udc40, conclusive) = \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc40)1 \u2212 Tr \ud835\udc40?\ud835\udf0c = Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c Tr [(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0c] , \ud835\udefd(\ud835\udc40) B \ud835\udc43(error | \ud835\udf0e, \ud835\udc40, conclusive) = \ud835\udefd(\ud835\udc40)1 \u2212 Tr \ud835\udc40?\ud835\udf0e = Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e Tr [(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e] ,\n(9)\nwhere \u2018conclusive\u2019 denotes the event of a conclusive measurement outcome. The minimal type II\n5 error probability is then\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) B inf \ud835\udc40\u2208\u21333\n{ \ud835\udefd(\ud835\udc40) \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc40) \u2264 \ud835\udf00} = inf \ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u22650 { Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e Tr [(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e] \ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 \u2264 1, Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0cTr [(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0c] \u2264 \ud835\udf00 } ,\n(10)\nwhere \u21333 denotes the set of all three-outcome measurements of the form {\ud835\udc401 , \ud835\udc402 , \ud835\udc40?}, and to avoid pathological cases the optimisation is implicitly restricted to be over operators such that Tr [(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e] , Tr [(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0c] > 0. By construction, this error can never be larger than the conventional error \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e), since choosing \ud835\udc40? = 0 reduces to the usual definitions of \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc40) and \ud835\udefd(\ud835\udc40).\nThe analogous symmetric error is defined as follows. First, given two states, \ud835\udf0c with prior probability \ud835\udc5d and \ud835\udf0e with prior \ud835\udc5e, a measurement \ud835\udc40 = {\ud835\udc401 , \ud835\udc402 , \ud835\udc40?} has the following probability of obtaining an incorrect outcome:\n\ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e |\ud835\udc40) B \ud835\udc43(error |\ud835\udc40) = \ud835\udc5d Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c + \ud835\udc5e Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e,\n(11)\nwhile the probability of obtaining a conclusive outcome is\n\ud835\udc5dconc(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e |\ud835\udc40) B \ud835\udc43(conclusive |\ud835\udc40) = 1 \u2212 ( \ud835\udc5d Tr \ud835\udc40?\ud835\udf0c + \ud835\udc5e Tr \ud835\udc40?\ud835\udf0e ) = \ud835\udc5d Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0c] + \ud835\udc5e Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e] = Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c + \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e)].\n(12)\nWe then define the postselected symmetric probability of error \ud835\udc5derr as the optimal conditional probability of error given a conclusive outcome \u2014 in other words, the smallest ratio of incorrect outcomes to all conclusive outcomes on average:\n\ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) B inf \ud835\udc40\u2208\u21333 \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e |\ud835\udc40) \ud835\udc5dconc(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e |\ud835\udc40)\n= inf \ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u22650, \ud835\udc401+\ud835\udc402\u22641\n\ud835\udc5d Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c + \ud835\udc5e Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c + \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e)] . (13)\nBefore stating our main results, we need to introduce several quantities which we will find to characterise the hypothesis testing errors defined above.\nUnderlying all of them is the max-relative entropy [49], defined as \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) B log inf { \ud835\udf06 \u2208 R+ \ud835\udf0c \u2264 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0e} = { log\n\ud835\udf0e\u22121/2\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0e\u22121/2 \u221e supp(\ud835\udf0c) \u2286 supp(\ud835\udf0e) \u221e otherwise.\n(14)\nHere, the inequality between operators is understood in terms of the positive semidefinite cone, i.e. \ud835\udf0c \u2264 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0e if and only if \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0e \u2212 \ud835\udf0c is a positive semidefinite operator, and \u2225\u00b7\u2225\u221e denotes the operator norm (largest singular value). Eq. (14) is typically defined for normalised quantum states \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf0e, although we will extend the same definition also to unnormalised positive semidefinite operators. This quantity can be understood as the sandwiched R\u00e9nyi divergence of order \u221e [50]; in the case\n6 where \ud835\udf0c = \ud835\udc43 and \ud835\udf0e = \ud835\udc44 are classical discrete probability distributions, this reduces to the \u221e\u2013R\u00e9nyi divergence \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc43\u2225\ud835\udc44) = \ud835\udc37\u221e(\ud835\udc43\u2225\ud835\udc44) = log sup\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc65)/\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc65).\nThe max-relative entropy gives rise to two important quantities: the Hilbert projective metric [51]\n\ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) B \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) + \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0e\u2225\ud835\udf0c) (15)\nand the Thompson metric [52] \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) B max { \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e), \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0e\u2225\ud835\udf0c) } . (16)\nThe two quantities have enjoyed a number of applications in various branches of geometry and analysis [51, 53]. Within quantum information theory, the Hilbert projective metric found operational use in characterising the convertibility of quantum states in different scenarios [54\u201356], often constituting the unique function that determines the existence of probabilistic transformations between quantum resources [56, 57]; the Thompson metric, on the other hand, was recently identified with the rate of a task known as symmetric distinguishability dilution [58], concerned with transformations of pairs of quantum states. To date, they have not been connected with rates of hypothesis testing tasks.\nThroughout this work, we assume that the considered quantum systems are finite dimensional.\nC. Results\nOur main results are the exact evaluation of the asymptotic error exponents in the setting of postselected hypothesis testing, both for asymmetric and symmetric discrimination, and both for quantum states and channels. The framework is shown to enjoy remarkably simplified properties compared to conventional hypothesis testing, allowing us to completely characterise the errors at the one-shot level as well as their asymptotic exponents. Notably, we show that the asymptotic exponents in asymmetric and symmetric postselected hypothesis testing are given exactly by the Hilbert and Thompson metrics, respectively, endowing the two quantities with operational meanings mirroring that of the quantum relative entropy and the Chernoff divergence. Our methods straightforwardly extend to the setting of composite hypothesis testing and channel discrimination, establishing results that are strictly stronger and more general than corresponding known results in conventional quantum hypothesis testing.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first time that the asymptotic setting of postselected hypothesis testing has been studied, even in the classical case; our results are therefore new also when the discrimination of quantum states is replaced with the discrimination of probability distributions (equivalently, commuting states).\nWe provide an overview of our main findings below.\nAsymmetric hypothesis testing. In Section II we show that the asymptotic exponent of the conditional type II error in discriminating any two quantum states is given by the Hilbert projective metric \ud835\udc37\u03a9 between them; specifically,\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) \u2200\ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1). (17)\nThis establishes an equivalent of quantum Stein\u2019s lemma in the setting of postselected hypothesis testing. We in fact establish a closed formula for the asymmetric hypothesis testing error probability already at the one-shot level, leading directly to the above asymptotic result. Specifically,\n7 our main result in Theorem 1 shows that\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) = ( \ud835\udf00 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf002 \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) + 1 )\u22121\n\u2200\ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1). (18)\nIn Section II D, we extend the above results to composite hypotheses, showing that when the alternative hypothesis \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b is replaced by a family of convex sets of density matrices (\u2131\ud835\udc5b)\ud835\udc5b that is closed under tensor product, then the asymptotic exponent is given by\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00,\u2131\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udf0c \u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc37\u221e\u03a9,\u2131 (\ud835\udf0c) B lim\ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \ud835\udc5b min \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5b\u2208\u2131\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5b) \u2200\ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1), (19)\nwhere \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00,\u2131\ud835\udc5b denotes the least conditional type II error in discriminating a state against all states in the set \u2131\ud835\udc5b . The above is the analogue of the conjectured generalised quantum Stein\u2019s lemma of [15], which is not known to hold in the setting of conventional quantum hypothesis testing, but which we show to be valid in the postselected setting.\nAnalogous findings are also valid for the discrimination of quantum channels. We show in Section IV that\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\u2133\u2297\ud835\udc5b ,\ud835\udca9\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = lim\ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e\u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd any \ud835\udf00 (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\u2133\u2225\ud835\udca9) \u2200\ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1), (20)\nwhere \ud835\udefd any \ud835\udf00 (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5b) denotes the error exponent obtained using the most general channel discrimination schemes that use \ud835\udc5b channel evaluations, and where \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\u2133\u2225\ud835\udca9) is given by the Hilbert projective metric between the Choi operators of the two channels, which does not require any regularisation and can be readily evaluated. Importantly, our results show that the performance of channel hypothesis testing is the same regardless of whether the channels are used in parallel or discriminated using broader schemes such as adaptive protocols. This equivalence holds both asymptotically and in the finite-copy regime.\nSymmetric hypothesis testing. In Section III we establish that the asymptotic exponent of the postselected symmetric error in distinguishing any two states equals their Thompson metric:\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) \u2200\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d \u2208 (0, 1). (21)\nThis is the equivalent of the Chernoff bound in the setting of postselected quantum hypothesis testing and gives a direct operational interpretation of the Thompson metric in state discrimination. As in the asymmetric case, the result is based on an exact quantification of the one-shot symmetric error probability, which we show in Theorem 6 to be\n\ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = ( 2\ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) + 1 )\u22121 . (22)\nThe above is generalised to quantum channels in Section IV, where we show that\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udc5derr(\u2133\u2297\ud835\udc5b ,\ud835\udca9\u2297\ud835\udc5b | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = lim\ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e\u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udc5d anyerr (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e | \ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc37\u039e(\u2133\u2225\ud835\udca9), (23)\nagain demonstrating that no advantage is gained by employing protocols more general than parallel ones.\nSection VI discusses how the above results in asymmetric and symmetric state discrimination are actually valid in physical theories broader than quantum mechanics, namely, settings under the umbrella of general probabilistic theories. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that asymptotic error exponents in hypothesis testing have been computed in such general theories \u2014 previous such results made explicit use of the properties of quantum mechanics or classical probability theory.\n8 II. ASYMMETRIC CASE\nA. One-shot discrimination error\nLet us recall the definition of the minimal postselected type II error,\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) = inf \ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u22650\n{ Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e\nTr [(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e] \ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 \u2264 1, Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0cTr [(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0c] \u2264 \ud835\udf00 } .

We will frequently encounter the non-logarithmic variant of the latter, for which we introduce the notation\n\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) B 2\ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e).

We begin by noticing that the constraint \ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 \u2264 1 in (24) is superfluous: for all \ud835\udc401 , \ud835\udc402 \u2265 0 that satisfy Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0cTr[(\ud835\udc401+\ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0c] \u2264 \ud835\udf00, one can always rescale them as \ud835\udc40 \u2032 \ud835\udc56 B \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56/\u2225\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402\u2225\u221e and they are then feasible for the original program with the same value of the objective function. Thus,2\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e)\u22121 = sup \ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u22650\n{ Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e]\nTr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e\nTr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0cTr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0c] \u2264 \ud835\udf00 } . (27)\nIn order to relate this optimisation with the Hilbert projective metric, we will use the dual form of the optimisation problem \u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). Writing\n\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) = \u03a9(\ud835\udf0e\u2225\ud835\udf0c) = inf { \ud835\udefe \u2208 R+ \ud835\udf0e \u2264 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0c \u2264 \ud835\udefe\ud835\udf0e, \ud835\udf06 \u2208 R+} , (28) the dual optimisation problem can be obtained as [57]\n\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) = sup {\nTr\ud835\udc34\ud835\udf0e Tr \ud835\udc35\ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc34, \ud835\udc35 \u2265 0, Tr\ud835\udc34\ud835\udf0cTr \ud835\udc35\ud835\udf0c \u2264 1} . (29) The similarity between the two problems can be noticed by rewriting the objective function of (27) as\nTr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e] Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e = 1 + Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0eTr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e . (30)\nTo make the relation explicit, let \ud835\udc401 , \ud835\udc402 \u2265 0 be arbitrary operators feasible for (27), and define\n\ud835\udc34 B (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00)\ud835\udc402 , \ud835\udc35 B \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc401.\n(31)\n2 A careful reader might wonder whether there is no danger of dividing by zero in this rewriting. That is not the case, as we can always constrain the optimisation to be over \ud835\udc401 such that Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e > 0. This can be seen by noting that, for every \ud835\udc401 such that Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e = 0, \ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udeff1 is also feasible for all \ud835\udeff > 0, and the error value of the original \ud835\udc401 is recovered in the limit \ud835\udeff \u2192 0.\n9 Notice now that Tr\ud835\udc34\ud835\udf0c Tr \ud835\udc35\ud835\udf0c = (1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00)Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udf00Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0c \u2264 1, (32)\nusing the fact that Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c\nTr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0c] \u2264 \ud835\udf00 \u21d0\u21d2 Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0cTr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c \u2265 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 \ud835\udf00 . (33)\n\ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 are therefore feasible operators for the dual optimisation problem for \u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) in (29), giving\n\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) \u2265 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 \ud835\udf00 Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0e Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 \ud835\udf00\n( Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e]\nTr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e \u2212 1\n) . (34)\nWorking backwards through the above reasoning, we can analogously show that any feasible solution {\ud835\udc34, \ud835\udc35} for \u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) in (29) gives a feasible solution {\ud835\udc401 , \ud835\udc402} for \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e)\u22121 in (27). The two problems are therefore equivalent, in the sense that\n\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 \ud835\udf00 ( \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e)\u22121 \u2212 1 ) , (35)\nwhich is precisely the statement of the theorem.\nAchievability. As long as \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) \u2260 0, i.e. \u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) < \u221e, a measurement that achieves the optimal error \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) can be readily constructed using the fact that \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0e\u2225\ud835\udf0c) = log\n\ud835\udf0c\u22121/2\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0c\u22121/2 \u221e. Let |\ud835\udf13max\u27e9 and |\ud835\udf13min\u27e9 be eigenvectors corresponding, respectively, to the largest and the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the operator \ud835\udf0c\u22121/2\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0c\u22121/2. Then, define\n?\u0303?1 B \ud835\udf0c\u22121/2 |\ud835\udf13min\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udf13min | \ud835\udf0c\u22121/2\n\ud835\udf00 , ?\u0303?2 B \ud835\udf0c\u22121/2 |\ud835\udf13max\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udf13max | \ud835\udf0c\u22121/2 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 .\n(36)\nNow we only need to rescale these operators into a valid POVM, that is, define the three-outcome measurement\n\ud835\udc40 B  ?\u0303?1 ?\u0303?1 + ?\u0303?2 \u221e , ?\u0303?2 ?\u0303?1 + ?\u0303?2 \u221e , 1 \u2212 ?\u0303?1 + ?\u0303?2 ?\u0303?1 + ?\u0303?2 \u221e  . (37) It can be verified that \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc40) = \ud835\udf00 and\n\ud835\udefd(\ud835\udc40) = ( 1 + \ud835\udf001 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 \ud835\udf0c\u22121/2\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0c\u22121/2 \u221e \ud835\udf0e\u22121/2\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0e\u22121/2 \u221e )\u22121 = \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e), (38)\nmeaning that the measurement is indeed optimal. An interesting point for the discrimination of many-copy states, i.e. \ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b and \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b , is as follows. An optimal measurement strategy can readily be constructed following the above recipe; remarkably, the operational procedure corresponding to the measurement one obtains in this way is a product strategy, i.e. it involves separate measurements on each individual copy of the state, which is much simpler to implement from a practical and technological perspective. To see this, let us define a single-copy measurement similarly to (37), except that we replace ?\u0303?1 and ?\u0303?2 with\n?\u0303?\u20321 B \ud835\udf0c\u22121/2 |\ud835\udf13min\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udf13min | \ud835\udf0c\u22121/2\n\ud835\udf001/\ud835\udc5b , ?\u0303?\u20322 B\n\ud835\udf0c\u22121/2 |\ud835\udf13max\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udf13max | \ud835\udf0c\u22121/2\n(1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00)1/\ud835\udc5b . (39)\nWe then measure each individual copy of \ud835\udf0c or \ud835\udf0e. If the outcome \u20181\u2019 is obtained \ud835\udc5b times, we guess \ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b ; if the outcome \u20182\u2019 is obtained \ud835\udc5b times, we guess \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b ; any other combination of outcomes is deemed inconclusive. Conditioned on a conclusive result, the probability of success of such a strategy is clearly the same as if we used the measurement (37) directly.\n10\nB. Asymptotic error exponent\nThe extension of Theorem 1 to the asymptotic setting is almost immediate. The crucial property of the Hilbert projective metric, and indeed also the Thompson metric, is that they are additive quantities: for all states \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf0e,\n\ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e), \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e).\n(40)\nThis follows from the additivity of \ud835\udc37max, which in turn follows directly from the definition and the fact that (\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b )\u22121/2 \ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b )\u22121/2\n\u221e = (\ud835\udf0e\u22121/2\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0e\u22121/2)\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u221e = \ud835\udf0e\u22121/2\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0e\u22121/2 \ud835\udc5b \u221e . (41)\nUsing this additivity and the two-sided inequality\n\ud835\udf00 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 \u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) \u2264 \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) \u22121 \u2264 11 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 \u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e), (42)\nitself a consequence of the fact that \u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) \u2265 1 for all \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e, we obtain\n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) + log \ud835\udf00 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 \u2264 \u2212 log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c \u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) \u2264 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) + log 1 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 .\n(43)\nThis immediately yields an expression for the asymptotic error exponent, which is the equivalent of quantum Stein\u2019s lemma in the setting of this work.\nCorollary 2 (Asymptotic error exponent of asymmetric postselected hypothesis testing). For all \ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1), we have that\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). (44)\nWhat is noteworthy about the expression in (43) is that there are no lower-order terms in \ud835\udc5b: the convergence to the asymptotic limit of Corollary 2 happens at least as fast as \ud835\udc42(1/\ud835\udc5b), which strongly contrasts with the case encountered in conventional quantum hypothesis testing [59, 60].\nC. Properties of the asymmetric error\nAs the asymptotic error exponent is given exactly by \ud835\udc37\u03a9, while the one-shot error \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00 is an inversely monotonic function of it, it suffices to characterise the properties of\ud835\udc37\u03a9 to fully understand the behaviour of the errors in both the one-shot and exponential settings.\nProposition 3. For all states \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf0e, and for all \ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1):\n(i) \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) \u2265 0, with equality if and only if \ud835\udf0c = \ud835\udf0e. Consequently, \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) \u2264 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00, with equality if and only if \ud835\udf0c = \ud835\udf0e.\n(ii) Both \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) and \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) are symmetric under the exchange of \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf0e, i.e. \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) = \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0e\u2225\ud835\udf0c) and \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) = \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0e, \ud835\udf0c).\n11\n(iii) For all positive numbers \ud835\udf06, \ud835\udf07, we have \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf0e) = \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e), and analogously \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf0e) = \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e).\n(iv) \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) = \u221e if and only if supp \ud835\udf0c \u2260 supp \ud835\udf0e. Hence, \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) = 0 if and only if \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf0e have non-identical supports.\n(v) \ud835\udc37\u03a9 satisfies the data-processing inequality under all positive maps; specifically, for every positive linear map \u2130,\n\ud835\udc37\u03a9 ( \u2130(\ud835\udf0c) Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) \u2130(\ud835\udf0e)Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0e) ) = \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\u2130(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225\u2130(\ud835\udf0e)) \u2264 \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). (45) Hence, \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00 ( \u2130(\ud835\udf0c) Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) , \u2130(\ud835\udf0e) Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0e) ) \u2265 \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e).\nProof. (i) holds because \ud835\udf0c \u2264 \ud835\udf0e and \ud835\udf0e \u2264 \ud835\udf0c can only be true if \ud835\udf0c = \ud835\udf0e. (ii) is an immediate consequence of the manifestly symmetric definition (15), together with Theorem 1. (iii) follows from the fact that \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf0e) = log \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf07 +\ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e), which is immediate from the definition. (iv) holds because \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) < \u221e if and only if supp \ud835\udf0c \u2286 supp \ud835\udf0e. (v) is a consequence of (iii) coupled with the fact that for all \ud835\udf06 such that \ud835\udf0c \u2264 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0e, the positivity of \u2130 ensures that \ud835\udf06\u2130(\ud835\udf0e) \u2212 \u2130(\ud835\udf0c) = \u2130(\ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0e \u2212 \ud835\udf0c) \u2265 0, so \ud835\udc37max(\u2130(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225\u2130(\ud835\udf0e)) \u2264 \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). Remark. The symmetry shown in Proposition 3(ii) is a priori highly non-obvious, and indeed one of the remarkable consequences of Theorem 1. Indeed, we started by looking at the error in asymmetric postselected hypothesis testing, but the expression we obtained is symmetric under the exchange of the two states. This can be understood as a consequence of the fact that, for all states \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e with supp \ud835\udf0c = supp \ud835\udf0e, there exists a completely positive map \u2130 such that \u2130(\ud835\udf0c) = \ud835\udf0e and \u2130(\ud835\udf0e) = \ud835\udc58\ud835\udf0c for some \ud835\udc58 \u2208 (0,\u221e) [54, Theorem 21]. Applying the data-processing inequality of Proposition 3(v) together with the scaling invariance (iii), we see that we must have \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) = \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0e\u2225\ud835\udf0c).\nIn all of the above, we have assumed that \ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1). The case \ud835\udf00 = 0 requires a separate treatment. Proposition 4. It holds that\n\ud835\udefd0(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) = {\n1 supp \ud835\udf0e \u2286 supp \ud835\udf0c, 0 otherwise.\n(46)\nProof. If supp \ud835\udf0e \u2286 supp \ud835\udf0c, then Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c = 0 implies that Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0e = 0. Any feasible pair {\ud835\udc401 , \ud835\udc402} such that Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e \u2260 0 then satisfies\nTr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e] = Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e = 1. (47)\nFor the case supp \ud835\udf0e \u2288 supp \ud835\udf0c, by hypothesis we know that there exists a pure state \ud835\udf13 such that Tr\ud835\udf13\ud835\udf0e > 0 but Tr\ud835\udf13\ud835\udf0c = 0. Pick \ud835\udc401 = \ud835\udeff1, \ud835\udc402 = (1 \u2212 \ud835\udeff)\ud835\udf13 for some \ud835\udeff \u2208 (0, 1) to conclude that any value of\nTr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e] = \ud835\udeff \ud835\udeff + (1 \u2212 \ud835\udeff)Tr\ud835\udf13\ud835\udf0e (48)\nis achievable. Taking the limit \ud835\udeff \u2192 0 gives the stated result.\nIt is a curious fact that \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) is symmetric in its arguments for \ud835\udf00 > 0 (Proposition 3(ii)), but no longer so for \ud835\udf00 = 0. This asymmetry is due to the situation where supp \ud835\udf0e is strictly contained in supp \ud835\udf0c. In this case, \ud835\udf0c can be distinguished from \ud835\udf0e, but not the other way around: consider the POVM {1\u2212\u03a0\ud835\udf0e , 0,\u03a0\ud835\udf0e} which allows us to conclude, whenever we obtain a conclusive outcome, that the state in our possession is \ud835\udf0c; however, the probability of a conclusive outcome when measuring \ud835\udf0e is zero. This problem is avoided for \ud835\udf00 > 0.\n12\nD. Composite postselected hypothesis testing\nIn the setting of composite hypothesis testing, we wish to distinguish between a given state \ud835\udf0c and a whole set of quantum states, denoted \u2131 . Let us first consider the case of conventional (nonpostselected) hypothesis testing. Here, for a given measurement \ud835\udc40, the performance is quantified with the worst-case type II error, i.e.\n\ud835\udefd\u2131 (\ud835\udc40) B sup \ud835\udf0e\u2208\u2131 \ud835\udefd(\ud835\udc40) = sup \ud835\udf0e\u2208\u2131 Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e, (49)\nand the optimised error is defined as \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00,\u2131 (\ud835\udf0c) B inf { \ud835\udefd\u2131 (\ud835\udc40) \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc40) \u2264 \ud835\udf00}. Brand\u00e3o and Plenio [15] conjectured a remarkable extension of the quantum Stein\u2019s lemma to composite hypothesis testing: namely, that for every family of sets (\u2131\ud835\udc5b)\ud835\udc5b satisfying a small number of regularity properties (including convexity and closedness under tensor product, partial trace, and permutations of systems), it holds that\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00,\u2131\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b) ? = \ud835\udc37\u221e\u2131 (\ud835\udf0c), (50)\nwhere \ud835\udc37\u221e\u2131 is the regularised relative entropy, \ud835\udc37 \u221e \u2131 (\ud835\udf0c) B lim\ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \ud835\udc5b min\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5b\u2208\u2131\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc37(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5b). Although a proof of this result was claimed in [15], issues with the derivation were recently uncovered [16], and (50) is therefore not known to hold in general.\nWe show that an analogue of the above result holds true in the setting of postselected hypothesis testing. To this end, define\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00,\u2131 (\ud835\udf0c) B inf \ud835\udc40\u2208\u21333\n{ \ud835\udefd\u2131 (\ud835\udc40) \ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc40) \u2264 \ud835\udf00} = inf\n\ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u22650 { sup \ud835\udf0e\u2208\u2131 Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e Tr [(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e] \ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 \u2264 1, Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0cTr [(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0c] \u2264 \ud835\udf00 } .\n(51)\nWe then show that the asymptotic error exponent of composite postselected hypothesis testing is given exactly by the regularisation of the Hilbert projective metric \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) optimised over the sets \u2131\ud835\udc5b .\nTheorem 5. For every convex and closed set of quantum states \u2131 , \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00,\u2131 (\ud835\udf0c) = (\n\ud835\udf00 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 min\ud835\udf0e\u2208\u2131 \u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) + 1\n)\u22121 . (52)\nAs a consequence, for all \ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1) and for all families of sets (\u2131\ud835\udc5b)\ud835\udc5b that are convex and closed, we have that\nlim inf \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00,\u2131\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udf0c \u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc37\u221e\u03a9,\u2131 (\ud835\udf0c), (53)\nwhere\n\ud835\udc37\u221e\u03a9,\u2131 (\ud835\udf0c) = lim inf\ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \ud835\udc5b min \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5b\u2208\u2131\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5b). (54)\nIf the sets (\u2131\ud835\udc5b)\ud835\udc5b are closed under tensor product, i.e. if \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5b\u2297\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5a \u2208 \u2131\ud835\udc5b+\ud835\udc5a for all \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5b \u2208 \u2131\ud835\udc5b and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc5a \u2208 \u2131\ud835\udc5a , then lim inf in (53)\u2013(54) can be replaced with lim, because the limits are achieved.\n13\nWe remark here that the quantity min\ud835\udf0e\u2208\u2131 \u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) can be computed as the optimal value of a conic linear optimisation problem [57]; when membership in the set \u2131 can be expressed using linear matrix inequalities, this reduces to a semidefinite program.\nProof.

It was shown, in particular, that the asymptotic error exponent in (conventional) asymmetric hypothesis testing (Eq. (50)) gives exactly the rate at which quantum entanglement can be distilled, i.e. converted to pure maximally entangled states, under the class of non-entangling quantum channels. This relation is mirrored exactly in postselected hypothesis testing: the quantity \ud835\udc37\u221e\u03a9,\u2131 (\ud835\udf0c) in Theorem 5 was recently shown to give the rate of distillation under probabilistic non-entangling operations [56], and here we have shown that it is also precisely the asymptotic error exponent.\nIII. SYMMETRIC CASE\nA. One-shot symmetric hypothesis testing error\nConsider the discrimination of two states, \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf0e, with their respective priors being \ud835\udc5d and \ud835\udc5e. Let us recall the definition of the postselected probability of error \ud835\udc5derr:\n\ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = inf \ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u22650, \ud835\udc401+\ud835\udc402\u22641 \ud835\udc5d Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c + \ud835\udc5e Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc5d Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0c] + \ud835\udc5e Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e] . (61)\nWe note that a closely related figure of merit appeared previously in [39], motivated by a framework generalising the setting of unambiguous state discrimination (cf. also [43]). There, the authors computed the postselected probability of success, which is just 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) in our notation. However, the asymptotic properties of this quantity were not studied, nor was its relation with the Thompson metric observed.\nOur first result establishes that the one-shot postselected discrimination error is given by a simple function of the Thompson metric, or rather its non-logarithmic variant\n\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) B 2\ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). (62)\nNote that below we will apply the Thompson metric also to rescaled quantum states as \u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e). In such a case, we use the exact same definition of the max-relative entropy as for normalised states, which gives\n\ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) = log inf { \ud835\udf06 \u2208 R+ \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c \u2264 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e} = log \ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc5e + \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e).\n(63)\nTheorem 6. For all states \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e and for all priors \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d \u2208 (0, 1), we have \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = ( \u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) + 1 )\u22121 . (64)\n15\nProof. We first derive the dual formulation of the Thompson metric. Writing \u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) = inf { max{\ud835\udf061 ,\ud835\udf062} 1\ud835\udf061 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e \u2264 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c \u2264 \ud835\udf062 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e }\n= inf { \ud835\udf06 | \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e \u2264 \ud835\udf06 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c \u2264 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e } ,\n(65)\nwe obtain the dual program as \u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) = sup { \ud835\udc5e Tr\ud835\udc34\ud835\udf0e + \ud835\udc5d Tr \ud835\udc35\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc34, \ud835\udc35 \u2265 0, \ud835\udc5e Tr \ud835\udc35\ud835\udf0e + \ud835\udc5d Tr\ud835\udc34\ud835\udf0c = 1} = sup\n\ud835\udc34,\ud835\udc35\u22650\n\ud835\udc5e Tr\ud835\udc34\ud835\udf0e + \ud835\udc5d Tr \ud835\udc35\ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc5e Tr \ud835\udc35\ud835\udf0e + \ud835\udc5d Tr\ud835\udc34\ud835\udf0c .\n(66)\nThe fact that we were justified in claiming that the optimal value of (65) equals the optimal value of (66) follows from the strong duality of the optimisation problem, easily seen by noticing that \ud835\udc34 = \ud835\udc35 = 1 are strongly feasible solutions and invoking Slater\u2019s theorem [63, Thm. 28.2].\nAs before, we see that the constraint \ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 \u2264 1 in the definition of \ud835\udc5derr is superfluous and we can ignore it without loss of generality. Notice then that\n\ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e)\u22121 = sup \ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u22650 \ud835\udc5e Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0e] + \ud835\udc5d Tr[(\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402)\ud835\udf0c] \ud835\udc5e Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e + \ud835\udc5d Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c\n= sup \ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u22650\n( 1 + \ud835\udc5e Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0e + \ud835\udc5d Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0c\n\ud835\udc5e Tr \ud835\udc401\ud835\udf0e + \ud835\udc5d Tr \ud835\udc402\ud835\udf0c ) = ( 1 + \u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) ) ,\n(67)\nwhere we used the dual program for the Thompson metric (66). This establishes the desired equivalence between the two problems.\nAchievability. A measurement that achieves the error \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) can be constructed again using the fact that \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) = log\n( \ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc5e \ud835\udf0e\u22121/2\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0e\u22121/2 \u221e) . Below, we will assume that \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) = \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) without loss of generality. Let |\ud835\udf13max\u27e9 be an eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the operator \ud835\udf0e\u22121/2\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0e\u22121/2. Then, define\n\ud835\udc4a = \ud835\udf0e\u22121/2 |\ud835\udf13max\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udf13max | \ud835\udf0e\u22121/2. (68)\nThis operator satisfies Tr\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udf0e = 1 and Tr\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udf0c = \ud835\udf0e\u22121/2\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0e\u22121/2 \u221e. Then, define the three-outcome\nPOVM { \ud835\udc4a\n\u27e8\ud835\udf13max | \ud835\udf0e\u22121 |\ud835\udf13max\u27e9 , 0, 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc4a \u27e8\ud835\udf13max | \ud835\udf0e\u22121 |\ud835\udf13max\u27e9\n} , (69)\nwhere we used that the largest (and the only non-zero) eigenvalue of \ud835\udc4a is \u27e8\ud835\udf13max | \ud835\udf0e\u22121 |\ud835\udf13max\u27e9. Although the probability of conclusively discriminating \ud835\udf0c is zero, the average error \ud835\udc5derr indeed matches the optimal value of (1+ \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e\n\ud835\udf0e\u22121/2\ud835\udf0c\ud835\udf0e\u22121/2 \u221e)\u22121. Note that when \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) = \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e\u2225\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c), the role of \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf0e is interchanged in the above discussion.\nB. Symmetric hypothesis testing error exponent\nUsing the additivity of \ud835\udc37max and the property that \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) = \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) + log \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5e , we have that\n\ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = max { log \ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc5e + \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e), log\n\ud835\udc5e \ud835\udc5d + \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0e\u2225\ud835\udf0c)\n} . (70)\n16\nFor large enough \ud835\udc5b, the maximum on the right-hand side will be determined only by the maximum between \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) and \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0e\u2225\ud835\udf0c), which implies that\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e 1 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e), (71)\nas long as the priors \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e are non-zero. Theorem 6 then immediately gives the asymptotic regularisation of the symmetric distinguishability error.\nCorollary 7 (Asymptotic error exponent of symmetric postselected hypothesis testing). For all states \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e and for all priors \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d \u2208 (0, 1),\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). (72)\nAs in the asymmetric case, the expression for\u2212 log \ud835\udc5derr (\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) contains no \ud835\udc5b-dependent terms of order lower than 1. Furthermore, and again in analogy with what happens in the asymmetric case, there is a product strategy achieving the asymptotically optimal conditional error probability in symmetric discrimination. It consists in making the measurement {\ud835\udc401 , \ud835\udc402 , \ud835\udc40?} detailed in (69) on each copy of the state, guessing \ud835\udf0c if the outcome \u20181\u2019 is obtained \ud835\udc5b times, and declaring an inconclusive result in any other case.\nFinally, we remark that the exact expression for many-copy discrimination error simplifies slightly for the case \ud835\udc5d = \ud835\udc5e = 12 , where the fact that \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) yields\n\u2212 log \ud835\udc5derr ( \ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b 12 , 12 ) = log (\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e)\ud835\udc5b + 1) (73) for every \ud835\udc5b.\nC. Properties of the symmetric error\nProposition 8. For all states \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf0e, and all priors \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d \u2208 (0, 1):\n(i) \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) \u2265 0, with equality if and only if \ud835\udf0c = \ud835\udf0e and \ud835\udc5d = \ud835\udc5e. Hence, \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) \u2264 12 , with equality if and only if \ud835\udf0c = \ud835\udf0e and \ud835\udc5d = \ud835\udc5e.\n(ii) \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) = \u221e if and only if supp \ud835\udf0c \u2260 supp \ud835\udf0e. Hence, \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = 0 if and only if \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf0e have different supports.\n(iii) For every positive linear map \u2130, the inequality \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc5d\u2130(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225\ud835\udc5e\u2130(\ud835\udf0e)) \u2264 \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) holds true.\nWe note that our conclusion in point (ii) was previously shown in [40].\nProof. (i) follows from the fact that \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c \u2264 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e and \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c \u2265 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e can both be true iff \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c = \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e, which is possible if and only if \ud835\udc5d = \ud835\udc5e and \ud835\udf0c = \ud835\udf0e due to \ud835\udf0c and \ud835\udf0e being normalised states. (ii) is a consequence of the fact that \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) < \u221e \u21d0\u21d2 supp \ud835\udf0c \u2286 supp \ud835\udf0e. (iii) is immediate because \u2130(\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e \u2212 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c) = \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5e\u2130(\ud835\udf0e) \u2212 \ud835\udc5d\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) \u2265 0 for every \ud835\udf06 such that \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c \u2264 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e due to the positivity of \u2130.\nNote that the monotonicity \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) \u2265 \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc5d\u2130(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225\ud835\udc5e\u2130(\ud835\udf0e)) does not mean that we can renormalise the state at the output, as we did in Proposition 3 for the asymmetric error. Indeed, in such\n17\na case we only get the inequality \u039e ( \ud835\udc5d\n\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) \ud835\udc5e \u2130(\ud835\udf0e)Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0e) ) \u2264 max {Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0e)Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0c)2\ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e) , Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0c)Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0e)2\ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e\u2225\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c)} \u2264 max { Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0e) Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) , Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0e) } \u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0e).\n(74)\nTo see that \u039e (\n\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) \u2130(\ud835\udf0e)Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0e) ) \u2270 \u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) in general, consider e.g. \ud835\udf0c = ( 2/3 00 1/3 ) and \ud835\udf0e = 1/2, in which case it is easy to verify that \u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) = 3/2. Setting \u2130(\u00b7) B \ud835\udc37(\u00b7)\ud835\udc37 with \ud835\udc37 B ( \u221a \ud835\udefe 0\n0 1/\u221a\ud835\udefe\n) and\n\ud835\udefe > 1, we find \u039e (\n\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) \u2130(\ud835\udf0e)Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0e) ) = 2\ud835\udefe2+1\ud835\udefe2+1 > 3/2 = \u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). IV. QUANTUM CHANNEL DISCRIMINATION\nA. One-shot channel hypothesis testing\nWe will now consider quantum channels, that is, completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) linear maps acting between the spaces of operators on the Hilbert spaces of two quantum systems, \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35. We denote such channels as \u2133 : \ud835\udc34 \u2192 \ud835\udc35 for simplicity. Complete positivity refers here to the property that not only is the map \u2133 positive, i.e. it maps positive operators to positive operators, but so is id \u2297 \u2133, where the ancillary space \ud835\udc45 is arbitrary. The set of quantum states of systems \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 will be denoted \ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc35, respectively.\nIf we only have access to a single copy of two channels \u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 : \ud835\udc34 \u2192 \ud835\udc35, there is only one thing we can do to discriminate them: feed in some state \ud835\udf0c into the channel, and then perform a distinguishing measurement at the output. However, a crucial insight here is that using a larger, entangled state and measurement can help discriminate the channels better than simply measuring \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c) for some \ud835\udf0c \u2208 \ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc34 [64]. Because of this, one performs channel hypothesis testing by measuring id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c) for some state \ud835\udf0c \u2208 \ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34, where id denotes the identity channel on the ancillary space \ud835\udc45, with the latter space arbitrary. We therefore define the postselected asymmetric and symmetric hypothesis testing errors as\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9) B inf\ud835\udf0c\u2208\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c), id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c)),\n\ud835\udc5derr(\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) B inf\ud835\udf0c\u2208\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc5derr(id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c), id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c) | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e).\n(75)\nFrom Theorems 1 and 6, we immediately have that\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9) = inf\ud835\udf0c\u2208\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34 [ \ud835\udf00 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 \u03a9(id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c)) + 1 ]\u22121 ,\n\ud835\udc5derr(\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = inf\ud835\udf0c\u2208\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34 [ \u039e ( \ud835\udc5d id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225\ud835\udc5e id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c) ) + 1 ]\u22121 .\n(76)\nIt may not be immediately obvious if these optimisation problems can be evaluated. However, by exploiting a property of the max-relative entropy noticed in [22], we can show that it suffices to take as input the maximally entangled state \u03a6+ = |\u03a6+\u27e9\u27e8\u03a6+ | with |\u03a6+\u27e9 = 1\u221a\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc34\n\u2211\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc56=1 |\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u27e9, which\nreduces the problem to evaluating \ud835\udc37max between two fixed states. We state this in the form of the following lemma.\n18\nLemma 9. For all channels \u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 : \ud835\udc34 \u2192 \ud835\udc35, define\n\u03a9(\u2133\u2225\ud835\udca9) B sup \ud835\udf0c\u2208\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34 \u03a9(id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c))\n\u039e(\u2133\u2225\ud835\udca9) B sup \ud835\udf0c\u2208\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34\n\u039e ( id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c) ) .\n(77)\nThen,\n\u03a9(\u2133\u2225\ud835\udca9) = \u03a9(\ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ) \u039e(\u2133\u2225\ud835\udca9) = \u039e(\ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ),\n(78)\nwhere \ud835\udc3d\u2133 and \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 denote the Choi states of the channels, defined as \ud835\udc3d\u2133 B id \u2297 \u2133(\u03a6+).\nProof. We will consider the Hilbert projective metric \u03a9, with the case of the Thompson metric \u039e being analogous.\nFirst, the bound \u03a9(\u2133\u2225\ud835\udca9) \u2265 \u03a9(\ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ) follows from the definition. For the other direction, observe that for any state \ud835\udf0c it holds that\n\ud835\udc37\u03a9 ( id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225 id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c)) = \ud835\udc37max( id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225 id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c)) + \ud835\udc37max( id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225 id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c))\n\u2264 sup \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc37max( id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225 id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c))\n+ sup \ud835\udf0c\u2032 \ud835\udc37max( id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c\u2032)\u2225 id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c\u2032))\n= \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ) + \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 \u2225\ud835\udc3d\u2133) = \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ),\n(79)\nwhere the second-to-last line follows because\nsup \ud835\udf0c \ud835\udc37max ( id \u2297 \u2133(\ud835\udf0c)\u2225 id \u2297 \ud835\udca9(\ud835\udf0c)) = \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ) (80)\nholds for all channels \u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 [22, Lemma 12]. Since this upper bound applies to any \ud835\udf0c, it holds also for the supremum, thus matching the lower bound.\nLemma 9 then immediately gives the following result, which establishes closed-form expressions for the asymmetric and symmetric error in postselected channel hypothesis testing.\nCorollary 10. For all \ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1) and \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d \u2208 (0, 1), we have that \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9) = ( \ud835\udf00 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 \u03a9(\ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ) + 1 )\u22121 ,\n\ud835\udc5derr(\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = ( \u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ) + 1 )\u22121 .\n(81)\nB. Asymptotic channel hypothesis testing\nWhen given \ud835\udc5b uses of a channel, the basic strategy is the so-called parallel channel discrimination, which simply puts the channel to be discriminated in a tensor product \u2133\u2297\ud835\udc5b and optimises over\n19\nall input states and measurements. Let us then define the \ud835\udc5b-copy parallel distinguishability errors as\n\ud835\udefd parallel \ud835\udf00 (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5b) B \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\u2133\u2297\ud835\udc5b ,\ud835\udca9\u2297\ud835\udc5b)\n= inf \ud835\udf0c\u2208\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34\u2297\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(id \u2297 \u2133\u2297\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udf0c), id \u2297 \ud835\udca9\u2297\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udf0c)),\n\ud835\udc5d parallel err (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e | \ud835\udc5b) B \ud835\udc5derr(\u2133\u2297\ud835\udc5b ,\ud835\udca9\u2297\ud835\udc5b | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e)\n= inf \ud835\udf0c\u2208\ud835\udc9f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc34\u2297\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc5derr(id \u2297 \u2133\u2297\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udf0c), id \u2297 \ud835\udca9\u2297\ud835\udc5b(\ud835\udf0c) | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e).\n(82)\nwhere the ancillary space \ud835\udc45 is a priori arbitrary. We stress that, although the channels are in a tensor product as\u2133\u2297\ud835\udc5b and\ud835\udca9\u2297\ud835\udc5b , the input states \ud835\udf0cmay be entangled, and the measurements at the output may be joint over all systems. Exact expressions for these quantities follow immediately from Corollary 10, showing also that it suffices to take the \ud835\udc5b-copy maximally entangled input state \u03a6\u2297\ud835\udc5b+ in the above. In particular, no entanglement between different copies is required in the preparation of the optimal input states. Furthermore, due to the discussion in Sections II A and III B, we know that also joint measurements are not necessary, and that an asymptotically optimal performance can be achieved by product strategies alone. These two facts, together, would considerably simplify any practical realisation of the above channel discrimination scheme.\nTo consider more general channel discrimination schemes, most works employ the formalism of adaptive discrimination schemes [21, 22, 25, 34, 65\u201367]. However, as we mentioned previously, it is known that broader types of channel manipulation protocols \u2014 in particular, ones that use more exotic transformation structures such as superposition of causal orders \u2014 can provide advantages over adaptive protocols [28, 30\u201332]. We will therefore aim to characterise the most general protocols allowed by the laws of quantum physics, without assuming anything whatsoever about their structure.\nTo discuss a general \ud835\udc5b-channel manipulation protocol, let us consider an \ud835\udc5b-linear map \u03a5 that takes \ud835\udc5b channels as input and outputs a single quantum state. Specifically, using (\ud835\udc34 \u2192 \ud835\udc35) to denote the space of all linear maps from \ud835\udc34 to \ud835\udc35, the map \u03a5 can be considered as a map from the space (\ud835\udc34 \u2192 \ud835\udc35)\u00d7\ud835\udc5b to (C \u2192 \ud835\udc45), where the latter is just the space of linear operators on some quantum system \ud835\udc45 of arbitrary dimension. In order for \u03a5 to be a valid channel transformation, we assume that it satisfies\n\u21331 , . . . ,\u2133\ud835\udc5b \u2208 CP(A \u2192 B) \u21d2 \u03a5(\u21331 , . . . ,\u2133n) \u2265 0, (83)\nwith CP(A \u2192 B) denoting the set of all completely positive maps between the two spaces. That is, the sole assumption we make is that the map \u03a5 is positive: it maps any \ud835\udc5b-tuple of completely positive maps into a positive operator. We do not enforce any form of complete positivity of this transformation, nor do we assume normalisation (trace preservation). By construction, any adaptive protocol is included under such a definition. We will use P\ud835\udc5b to denote the set of all \ud835\udc5b-linear maps \u03a5 : (\ud835\udc34 \u2192 \ud835\udc35)\u00d7\ud835\udc5b \u2192 (C\u2192 \ud835\udc45) satisfying (83).\nWe then define\n\ud835\udefd any \ud835\udf00 (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5b) B inf\u03a5\u2208P\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00 ( \u03a5(\u2133\u00d7\ud835\udc5b),\u03a5(\ud835\udca9\u00d7\ud835\udc5b) ) \ud835\udc5d\nany err (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e | \ud835\udc5b) B inf\u03a5\u2208P\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc5derr ( \u03a5(\u2133\u00d7\ud835\udc5b),\u03a5(\ud835\udca9\u00d7\ud835\udc5b) | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e ) ,\n(84)\nwhere \u2133\u00d7\ud835\udc5b denotes the \ud835\udc5b-tuple (\u2133 , . . . ,\u2133). With these definitions in place, we are ready to state our main result on channel discrimination.\n20\nTheorem 11. For all \ud835\udc5b \u2208 N, we have that\n\ud835\udefd any \ud835\udf00 (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udefd parallel \ud835\udf00 (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5b),\n\ud835\udc5d any err (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e | \ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc5d parallel err (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e | \ud835\udc5b).\n(85)\nIn particular, the asymptotic exponent of asymmetric postselected channel discrimination is given by the Hilbert projective metric between the Choi operators of the channels, regardless of whether only parallel or any general discrimination schemes are employed: for all \ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1),\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd any \ud835\udf00 (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5b) = lim\ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e\u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd parallel \ud835\udf00 (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5b)\n= \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\u2133\u2225\ud835\udca9) = \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ).\n(86)\nSimilarly, for all types of discrimination protocols, the asymptotic exponent of symmetric postselected channel discrimination is given by the Thompson metric between the Choi operators of the channels. That is, for all priors \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d \u2208 (0, 1),\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udc5d anyerr (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e | \ud835\udc5b) = lim\ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e\u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udc5d parallelerr (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e | \ud835\udc5b)\n= \ud835\udc37\u039e(\u2133\u2225\ud835\udca9) = \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ).\n(87)\nThe result establishes a complete equivalence of parallel discrimination strategies and more general protocols, not only at the asymptotic level but also for any finite number of channel uses. The computation of the asymmetric (Stein) exponent is an analogue of a corresponding result in conventional discrimination of quantum channels [22\u201324], but strictly stronger: Theorem 11 applies even beyond adaptive discrimination strategies, and furthermore proves the strong converse property of postselected channel discrimination, which is not known to hold in the conventional setting. The evaluation of the symmetric (Chernoff) exponent has no known analogue in conventional hypothesis testing of quantum channels.\nProof. The inclusion of parallel protocols in general channel discrimination protocols implies that\n\ud835\udefd any \ud835\udf00 (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5b) \u2264 \ud835\udefd parallel \ud835\udf00 (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5b) = ( \ud835\udf00 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00 \u03a9(\ud835\udc3d \u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc3d \u2297\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udca9 ) + 1 )\u22121 ,\n\ud835\udc5d any err (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e | \ud835\udc5b) \u2264 \ud835\udc5d parallel err (\u2133 ,\ud835\udca9 | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e | \ud835\udc5b) = ( \u039e(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc3d\u2297\ud835\udc5b\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc3d \u2297\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udca9 ) + 1 )\u22121 .\n(88)\nThe equalities in the above follow by Corollary 10. For the other direction, we employ the result of [68, Theorem 13], which states that\n\ud835\udc37max ( \u03a5(\u2133\u00d7\ud835\udc5b)\u2225\u03a5(\ud835\udca9\u00d7\ud835\udc5b) ) \u2264 \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2225\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ) (89)\nfor every \u03a5 \u2208 P\ud835\udc5b . To see that Eq. (89) is true, and in particular that the assumptions of linearity and positivity of the channel transformations are sufficient, consider any feasible\ud835\udf06 such that \ud835\udc3d\u2133 \u2264 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udca9 ,\n21\ni.e. \ud835\udf06\ud835\udca9 \u2212\u2133 is a completely positive map.

By the properties of P\ud835\udc5b (Eq. (83)), all of the terms on the right-hand side are positive operators, ensuring that \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5b \u03a5(\ud835\udca9 , . . . ,\ud835\udca9) \u2265 \u03a5(\u2133 , . . . ,\u2133) and thus \ud835\udc37max (\u03a5(\u2133\u00d7\ud835\udc5b)\u2225\u03a5(\ud835\udca9\u00d7\ud835\udc5b)) \u2264 \ud835\udc5b log\ud835\udf06.

Composite channel hypothesis testing\nThe case of composite channel discrimination can be considered very similarly.

RESOURCE THEORY OF ASYMMETRIC DISTINGUISHABILITY\nThe resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability was introduced in [69, 70] as a way to treat the distinguishability of quantum states operationally. Just as general resource theories [71] are concerned with transforming quantum states under some set of restricted, \u2018free\u2019 operations, the theory of distinguishability studies the transformations of pairs of quantum states (\u2018boxes\u2019) under channels that act as (\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) \u2192 (\u2133(\ud835\udf0c),\u2133(\ud835\udf0e)), and therefore do not increase the distinguishability between the two states. The standard resourceful box, representing a unit of \u2018perfect distinguishability\u2019, is represented by the pair (|0\u27e9\u27e80| , 1212). In this context, the task of distinguishability distillation was defined as transforming a given box (\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) into tensor powers of the standard box, (|0\u27e9\u27e80|\u2297\ud835\udc5a , 12\ud835\udc5a 1\u2297\ud835\udc5a2 ). An equivalent variant of this task can be defined by considering the transformation (\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) \u2192 (|0\u27e9\u27e80| ,\ud835\udf0b2\ud835\udc5a ) instead, where \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc58 B 1\ud835\udc58 |0\u27e9\u27e80| + \ud835\udc58\u22121 \ud835\udc58\n|1\u27e9\u27e81|, with the advantage that the latter approach allows the parameter \ud835\udc5a to vary continuously.\nA result of [70] was to identify the one-shot distillable distinguishability with the hypothesis testing relative entropy \ud835\udc37\ud835\udf00\n\ud835\udc3b [72, 73], which is equal to the optimised type II error in hypothesis\ntesting: \ud835\udc37\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc3b (\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) B \u2212 log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). A natural extension of this result to the asymptotic case where\n23\n(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) \u2192 (|0\u27e9\u27e80|\u2297\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b , 12\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b 1\u2297\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b2 ), coupled with the quantum Stein\u2019s lemma, shows that the value of asymptotically distillable distinguishability can be identified with the relative entropy \ud835\udc37(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e), recovering and extending a finding of [69] (cf. also [74]).\nWe can obtain an analogous result in our setting, giving an operational interpretation in the resource theory of asymmetric distinguishability to the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy\n\ud835\udc37 \ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) B \u2212 log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). (100)\nTo do so, the transformations under quantum channels need to be replaced with transformations under probabilistic maps.\nCorollary 14. Define the probabilistically distillable distinguishability as\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc51,prob(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) B log sup\n\u2130\u2208CPTNI\n{ \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc39 ( \u2130(\ud835\udf0c)Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) , |0\u27e9\u27e80|) \u2265 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00, \u2130(\ud835\udf0e)Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0e) = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc58 } , (101) where \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udf14, \ud835\udf0f) =\n\u221a\ud835\udf14\u221a\ud835\udf0f 21 is the fidelity and CPTNI denotes all completely positive and trace\u2013nonincreasing maps. Then\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc51,prob(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) = \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). (102)\nWe remark that the fidelity can be replaced with the trace distance 12 \u2130(\ud835\udf0c)Tr\u2130(\ud835\udf0c) \u2212 |0\u27e9\u27e80| 1 in the\nabove without affecting the result.\nProof. Applying [57, Corollary 14] gives that\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc51,prob(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) = log ( \ud835\udf00 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf00\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) + 1 ) . (103)\nBut in Theorem 1 we have identified the right-hand side with \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udf00 \ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e), and so the stated result follows.\nAn asymptotic extension of this result can be used to show that the rate of distinguishability distillation using probabilistic (CPTNI) operations is given by \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). This was also recently shown in [56] through a more general approach applicable to broader resource theories.\nThe work [70] studied the reverse task of distinguishability dilution, that is, the transformation from the maximal box to a given pair of quantum states. In this context, a connection with the max-relative entropy\ud835\udc37max was obtained. In an analogous way, in the conceptually related resource theory of symmetric distinguishability [58], the corresponding task of dilution was connected with the Thompson metric \ud835\udc37\u039e. In contrast, in our probabilistic setting, the task of dilution trivialises \u2014 any state can be obtained from a pure state probabilistically [57].\nVI. GENERAL PROBABILISTIC THEORIES\nThe framework of general probabilistic theories (GPTs) [75\u201377] encompasses both quantum and classical probability theory, providing a natural way to study the properties of very general physical theories, and in particular to formalise the similarities and differences between them. Although concepts such as states and measurements can be defined in any such setting, studying the optimal errors in the asymptotic regime did not appear possible \u2014 the optimal error exponents encountered in classical and quantum theory involve quantities such as the quantum relative entropy \ud835\udc37(\u00b7\u2225\u00b7) and\n24\nthe Chernoff divergence \ud835\udf09(\u00b7\u2225\u00b7), both of which require the properties of classical or quantum theory even to be defined. Because of this, no results whatsoever have been known about asymptotic hypothesis testing in broader GPTs. Our framework, however, can be straightforwardly adapted also to such general theories, and we will see that our findings on state discrimination in Sections II and III hold in arbitrary GPTs verbatim.\nA. Definitions\nTo define a GPT, one first identifies the compact and convex set \ud835\udcae of states within a real vector space \ud835\udcb1, here assumed to be finite dimensional. In analogy with the geometry of quantum theory, the affine hull of the set \ud835\udcae is required to have co-dimension 1 within \ud835\udcb1, and to not contain the zero vector.3 The cone generated by \ud835\udcae, namely \ud835\udc9e B { \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0c\n\ud835\udf06 \u2208 R+ , \ud835\udf0c \u2208 \ud835\udcae}, is used to induce a partial order on the space \ud835\udcb1 as \ud835\udc65 \u2264\ud835\udc9e \ud835\udc66 \u21d0\u21d2 \ud835\udc66 \u2212 \ud835\udc65 \u2208 \ud835\udc9e. The compactness of \ud835\udcae, which implies that \ud835\udc9e is pointed, or \ud835\udc9e \u2229 (\u2212\ud835\udc9e) = {0}, indeed means that this is a partial order. Furthermore, the fact that the affine hull of \ud835\udcae is full dimensional entails that \ud835\udc9e is generating, i.e. span(\ud835\udc9e) = \ud835\udcb1.\nThe dual space \ud835\udcb1*, i.e. the space of continuous linear functionals \ud835\udc40 : \ud835\udcb1 \u2192 R, then has a partial order \ud835\udc4b \u2264\ud835\udc9e* \ud835\udc4c \u21d0\u21d2 \ud835\udc4c \u2212 \ud835\udc4b \u2208 \ud835\udc9e* induced by the dual cone \ud835\udc9e* B { \ud835\udc40 \u2208 \ud835\udcb1* \u27e8\ud835\udc40, \ud835\udf0c\u27e9 \u2265 0 \u2200\ud835\udf0c \u2208 \ud835\udcae}, where we write \u27e8\ud835\udc40, \ud835\udc65\u27e9 = \ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc65) for every \ud835\udc65 \u2208 \ud835\udcb1, \ud835\udc40 \u2208 \ud835\udcb1*. We use the notation \ud835\udc4b <\ud835\udc9e* \ud835\udc4c to denote \ud835\udc4c \u2212 \ud835\udc4b \u2208 int(\ud835\udc9e*).\nIn order to define measurements in this theory, we also need to identify the set of effects, that is, elements of the dual space which yield physical measurement outcomes. First, a fixed unit effect \ud835\udc48 >\ud835\udc9e* 0 is defined as the unique element of \ud835\udcb1* such that \u27e8\ud835\udc48, \ud835\udf0c\u27e9 = 1 \u2200\ud835\udf0c \u2208 \ud835\udcae. The so-called no restriction hypothesis [75, 79, 80] then allows us to assume that every element \ud835\udc40 \u2208 \ud835\udcb1* such that \u27e8\ud835\udc40, \ud835\udf0c\u27e9 \u2208 [0, 1] \u2200\ud835\udf0c \u2208 \ud835\udcae is a valid effect, and thus a valid measurement operator; this can be equivalently understood as 0 \u2264\ud835\udc9e* \ud835\udc40 \u2264\ud835\udc9e* \ud835\udc48 . A measurement is then a collection of effects {\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56}\ud835\udc56 such that \u2211\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc48 \u2014 in other words, a collection such that the measurement outcome probabilities \u27e8\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udf0c\u27e9 sum to unity for every state \ud835\udf0c. We remark that both quantum and classical probability theory are special cases of the above. Although the Hilbert space underlying the setting of quantum mechanics is complex, the space where density operators live \u2014 corresponding to \ud835\udcb1 here \u2014 is nevertheless a real vector space, which is why the general assumptions of GPTs encompass quantum mechanics. Specifically, in the quantum case, \ud835\udcb1 is the space of self-adjoint operators acting on some complex Hilbert space, \ud835\udc9e and \ud835\udc9e* are both cones of postive semidefinite operators, and the unit effect \ud835\udc48 is the identity.\nWe will use the tuple (\ud835\udcb1 , \ud835\udc9e , \ud835\udc48) to denote a GPT as above, as the theory is uniquely determined by the three choices. Given two GPTs, (\ud835\udcb1\ud835\udc34 , \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34 , \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc34) and (\ud835\udcb1\ud835\udc35 , \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc35 , \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc35), we then wish to define a bipartite structure that combines the two. Under natural assumptions including the so-called local tomography principle, which states that bipartite states should be fully determined by the statistics of local measurements, it holds that \ud835\udcb1\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 is isomorphic to \ud835\udcb1\ud835\udc34 \u2297\ud835\udcb1\ud835\udc35 [81, 82], which means that we can identify \ud835\udcb1\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 = \ud835\udcb1\ud835\udc34 \u2297\ud835\udcb1\ud835\udc35 and \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 = \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc34 \u2297\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc35 without loss of generality. Interestingly, this does not uniquely determine a bipartite cone \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35; the only thing that can be concluded is that [83]\n\ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34 \u2297 min \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc35 \u2286 \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 \u2286 \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34 \u2297 max \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc35 (104)\n3 This seemingly ad hoc set of axioms is actually well justified from a foundational perspective. We refer the interested reader to [78, Chapters 1\u20132] for more details on these points as well as complete derivations.\n25\nwhere the minimal tensor product and the maximal tensor product are defined, respectively, as\n\ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34 \u2297 min \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc35 B conv(\ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34 \u2297 \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc35),\n\ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34 \u2297 max \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc35 B ( \ud835\udc9e\u2217\ud835\udc34 \u2297min\ud835\udc9e \u2217 \ud835\udc35 ) *.\n(105)\nFor every pair of non-classical GPTs, it holds that \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34 \u2297 min \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc35 \u2260 \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34 \u2297 max \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc35 [84], and the difference between these two cones is paramount to understanding properties of multipartite GPTs, in particular the existence of phenomena such as entanglement [83, 85].\nDespite the fact that many aspects of GPTs crucially depend on the specific choice of a multipartite cone \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35, our results will apply to any choice of \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 as in (104), making them universally applicable. We remark in particular that \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34 \u2297 \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc35 \u2286 \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 and \ud835\udc9e\u2217\ud835\udc34 \u2297 \ud835\udc9e \u2217 \ud835\udc35 \u2286 \ud835\udc9e\u2217 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 for all valid choices of \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35. The extension of the above to the tensor product of more than two GPTs is immediate.\nB. Extension of results\nThe task of state discrimination, in both the conventional and postselected settings, can be formulated in exactly the same way as we have done it in Section I; specifically,\n\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e) = inf \ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u2265\ud835\udc9e*0\n{ \u27e8\ud835\udc401 , \ud835\udf0e\u27e9\n\u27e8\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 , \ud835\udf0e\u27e9 \ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 \u2264\ud835\udc9e* \ud835\udc48, \u27e8\ud835\udc402 , \ud835\udf0c\u27e9\u27e8\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 , \ud835\udf0c\u27e9 \u2264 \ud835\udf00} \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = inf\n\ud835\udc401 ,\ud835\udc402\u2265\ud835\udc9e*0, \ud835\udc401+\ud835\udc402\u2264\ud835\udc9e*\ud835\udc48\n\ud835\udc5d \u27e8\ud835\udc402 , \ud835\udf0c\u27e9 + \ud835\udc5e \u27e8\ud835\udc401 , \ud835\udf0e\u27e9 \ud835\udc5d \u27e8\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 , \ud835\udf0c\u27e9 + \ud835\udc5e \u27e8\ud835\udc401 + \ud835\udc402 , \ud835\udf0e\u27e9 , (106)\nwhere \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e \u2208 \ud835\udcae and \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d \u2208 (0, 1) as before. The equivalent of the max-relative entropy can also be defined in the same way,\n\ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) B log inf { \ud835\udf06 \u2208 R+ \ud835\udf0c \u2264\ud835\udc9e \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0e} , (107) with the definitions of \ud835\udc37\u03a9 and \ud835\udc37\u039e naturally extending to the GPT formalism using the above quantity.\nThe results of our Theorem 1 (asymmetric error) and Theorem 6 (symmetric error) then apply to any GPT exactly as stated under the replacement Tr(\ud835\udc40\u00b7) \u21a6\u2192 \u27e8\ud835\udc40, \u00b7\u27e9 \u2014 there is no need to adjust any of the proofs, as we have not made use of any properties of quantum mechanics, with our proofs resting on the linearity of the trace and convex (Lagrange) duality, both of which hold for arbitrary GPTs defined as in Section VI A.\nThis correspondence is not too surprising, given that many results on one-shot state discrimination can be mapped between quantum mechanics and GPTs [86, 87]. What is more remarkable about the setting of postselected hypothesis testing is that the asymptotic results \u2014 namely, Corollary 2 and Corollary 7 \u2014 are also valid in arbitrary GPTs, with no other assumptions needed. This is because of the easily verified additivity of \ud835\udc37max, which we formalise below.\nLemma 15. Given a local GPT (\ud835\udcb1 , \ud835\udc9e , \ud835\udc48), consider any \ud835\udc5b-copy GPT (\ud835\udcb1\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5b), where \ud835\udcb1\ud835\udc5b = \u2297\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udcb1, \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc5b = \u2297\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc48 , and \u2297\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56=1\nmin \ud835\udc9e \u2286 \ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc5b \u2286\n\u2297\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56=1\nmax \ud835\udc9e. Then, for all \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e \u2208 \ud835\udcae,\n\ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e). (108)\n26\nProof. Consider any feasible \ud835\udf06 such that \ud835\udf0c \u2264\ud835\udc9e \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0e. Then, \ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2264\ud835\udc9e\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0e)\u2297\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b ; this can be seen by using the fact that \ud835\udc9e \u2297\nmin \ud835\udc9e \u2286 \ud835\udc9e2 to show that\n\ud835\udf062(\ud835\udf0e \u2297 \ud835\udf0e) \u2212 \ud835\udf0c \u2297 \ud835\udf0c = (\ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0e \u2212 \ud835\udf0c) \u2297 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0e + \ud835\udf0c \u2297 (\ud835\udf06\ud835\udf0e \u2212 \ud835\udf0c) \u2265\ud835\udc9e2 0 (109)\nand extending to arbitrary \ud835\udc5b by induction. This implies that \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b) \u2264 \ud835\udc5b log\ud835\udf06, and hence \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) \u2264 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e).\nFor the other direction, we write \ud835\udc37max in its dual form as\n\ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) = log sup \ud835\udc4a\u2265\ud835\udc9e*0\n\u27e8\ud835\udc4a, \ud835\udf0c\u27e9 \u27e8\ud835\udc4a, \ud835\udf0e\u27e9 . (110)\nThe fact that \u2297\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc9e* \u2286 \ud835\udc9e\u2217\ud835\udc5b immediately implies that any feasible solution \ud835\udc4a to \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) gives a feasible solution to \ud835\udc37max(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) as \ud835\udc4a\u2297\ud835\udc5b , concluding the proof.\nThe above lemma tells us that \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) and \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b \u2225\ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) for all normalised \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e \u2208 \ud835\udcae. The asymptotic results of Corollaries 2 and 7 thus follow directly; namely, we have that\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf00(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc37\u03a9(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) (111)\nand\nlim \ud835\udc5b\u2192\u221e \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5b log \ud835\udc5derr(\ud835\udf0c\u2297\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udf0e\u2297\ud835\udc5b | \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e) = \ud835\udc37\u039e(\ud835\udf0c\u2225\ud835\udf0e) (112)\nfor all \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udf0e \u2208 \ud835\udcae, all \ud835\udf00 \u2208 (0, 1), and all \ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc5e = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5d \u2208 (0, 1). Theorem 5, which establishes a postselected generalisation of the quantum Stein\u2019s lemma in the composite setting, also immediately holds in every GPT. The proof is, once again, noticed not to use any assumptions save for linearity and convex duality.\nWe thus see that virtually all of our results on state discrimination immediately extend to GPTs, without requiring any restrictive assumptions on the latter. On the other hand, although we expect at least some of our channel discrimination results to also be generalisable to GPTs under some reasonable assumptions, we should note that this is far from immediate \u2014 even defining a \u2018channel\u2019 is no trivial task in a framework so general, and tools such as the Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism might no longer be available to us. We thus leave the question of investigating channel discrimination in this setting as an open problem.\nVII. DISCUSSION\nThe approach of our work is inherently different from conventional quantum hypothesis testing, yet we hope that it can ultimately prove helpful in shedding light also on the latter. The distinguishing feature of our results, and perhaps an unexpected finding, is how significantly the whole framework simplifies in the postselected setting: the optimal probabilities can be given straightforward closed-form expressions; the case of composite hypothesis testing reduces to a simple extension of the i.i.d. case; all terms but those linear in \ud835\udc5b disappear from the asymptotic expansions; and, importantly, the task of channel discrimination not only admits efficiently computable error probabilities and exponents, but in fact reduces all discrimination strategies to the much simpler case of parallel protocols. This allowed us to essentially characterise completely the task of postselected quantum hypothesis testing with just a few concise proofs \u2014 something that,\n27\nin the conventional setting, has been a multi-decade endeavour requiring significant effort and the development of highly specialised methods.\nAn underlying property of our framework is the need to condition on a conclusive outcome of the measurement. This is an easily realisable operation: simply repeat the measurement protocol, disregarding measurement data corresponding to inconclusive outcomes. It is, however, conceivable that the conclusive outcome may have a low probability of occurrence, meaning that many repetitions of the measurement protocol would be needed to successfully discriminate the states or channels. Such a difference indeed makes direct comparisons between \ud835\udc5b-copy distinguishability protocols in the postselected and conventional settings difficult to perform. However, as we argued in [56], allowing postselection is much more easily justified in the limit of infinitely many i.i.d. copies, where the definition of a rate may be adjusted depending on what \u2018cost function\u2019 we wish to employ: if we are interested in error rates per number of copies of states generated, then the conventional setting appears more appropriate; if, however, we instead focus on how many copies of states need to be manipulated at once, then any protocol may be repeated without incurring an additional cost, and a postselected setting is thus perfectly natural. The latter assumption is not necessarily an extravagant one \u2014 generating many copies of states is far easier than coherently manipulating them with current technologies.\nThe idea of postselection has previously appeared in a range of contexts in quantum information, including \u2014 besides the aforementioned state discrimination [35\u201337] \u2014 quantum computing [88], metrology [89\u201393], connections with spacetime geometry [94\u201396], and manipulation of quantum entanglement [97\u201399] as well as more general quantum resources [54, 56, 57]. In such settings, our results can be viewed as ultimate limits that cannot be exceeded even if postselection is permitted: the optimal discrimination error bounds shown in our work cannot be beat by any measurement strategy, postselected or not, even in permissive frameworks such as ones allowing the increased distinguishing power of postselected closed timelike curves [94, 96].\nUltimately, although it might be contentious to claim that it has directly led to practical advancements, postselection has unquestionably contributed to the understanding of the foundations of quantum mechanics [100\u2013102], and even formed the conceptual basis of the first proposals for quantum supremacy experiments [103]. In a similar manner, we hope that our results can find use both in the formalisation of the foundations of quantum information, as well as in the study of the limits of practical state and channel discrimination protocols.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Yonglong Li and Marco Tomamichel for discussions on related settings studied in classical hypothesis testing [48].
