    "abstractText": "Complex scalar fields charged under approximate U(1) symmetries appear in well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model. One example is the field that contains the QCD axion field associated with the Peccei-Quinn symmetry; others include flat directions in supersymmetric theories with baryon, lepton, or flavor charges. These fields may take on large values and rotate in field space in the early universe. The relevant approximate U(1) symmetry ensures that the angular direction of the complex field is light during inflation and that the rotation is thermodynamically stable and is long-lived. These properties allow rotating complex scalar fields to naturally serve as curvatons and explain the observed perturbations of the universe. The scenario imprints non-Gaussianity in the curvature perturbations, likely at a level detectable in future large scale structure observations. The rotation can also explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe without producing excessive isocurvature perturbations. 1 ar X iv :2 20 2. 01 78 5v 1 [ he pph ] 3 F eb 2 02 2",

            "text": "In the simplest inflationary cosmology, an inflaton field is not only responsible for solving the horizon and flatness problems, but also for the adiabatic perturbations that seed the structure of the universe. However, these perturbations could arise from fluctuations imprinted in another field that is light during the inflationary epoch, the so-called curvaton [1\u20133]. The curvaton must be also long-lived so that it may come to dominate the energy density of the universe; this ensures the non-Gaussianity of cosmic perturbations is not too large [4]. Also, for a curvaton scenario to be successful, the observed baryon asymmetry and dark matter must originate from the curvaton itself or the entropy created from it; otherwise too-large matter isocurvature perturbations are produced [4].\nBut what is the identity of the curvaton? This question is pressing given the nonminimality of the curvaton scenario, coupled with the required special properties of the curvaton, namely its lightness and longevity. Here, we show that a rotating complex scalar field associated with an approximate U(1) symmetry can naturally play the role of a curvaton, because of the lightness of the angular direction and the longevity of the rotation. Complex scalar fields associated with approximate U(1) symmetries are ubiquitous in theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). In the axion solution to the strong CP problem [5\u20138], a complex scalar field associated with the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is introduced, and the PQ symmetry is explicitly broken by the QCD anomaly, so the symmetry is only approximate. In supersymmetric theories, scalar superpartners of SM particles are introduced, and combinations of them are charged under approximate symmetries such as baryon number plus lepton number (B + L) or flavor symmetries.\nBecause these symmetries are only approximate, it is plausible that they may also be explicitly broken by a higher-dimensional potential for our complex field P . Then rotations of P , which correspond to a non-zero U(1) charge, may be induced by a mechanism employed in Affleck-Dine baryogenesis [9\u201311]; namely, a \u201ckick\u201d may be given to the angular direction by the higher-dimensional explicit breaking. A large early-universe field value for P may result from a negative Hubble-induced mass term; such a large field value enhances the importance of the U(1)-breaking term. The angular direction of P remains light during inflation because of the approximate U(1) symmetry and thus obtains quantum fluctuations [12\u201316]. These fluctuations lead to fluctuations in the U(1) charge induced by the kick.\nThe rotation initially contains both angular and radial motion, but once P is thermalized via interactions with the thermal bath, the radial motion dissipates, and the rotation becomes circular [17]. Upon thermalization, a small fraction of the charge is transferred into a particle-antiparticle asymmetry in the thermal bath, but it is free-energetically favored to keep almost all of the charge in the form of rotation [17, 18]. This thermodynamic stability ensures the longevity of the rotation.\nWe assume that P has a nearly quadratic potential. This is indeed the case for the flat directions in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) (see [19] for a survey of MSSM flat directions) and for a class of PQ symmetry breaking fields. With this assumption, the energy density of the rotation decreases due to cosmic expansion as matter, so this energy density can eventually exceed that of radiation. The present-day entropy of the Universe can then be created by the (partial) washout of the U(1) charge, and the fluctuations of the U(1) charge create curvature perturbations; the rotation functions as a curvaton.\nSimilar to the conventional curvaton that arises from an oscillating field [4], this scenario predicts an observable amount of local non-Gaussianity in the curvature perturbations. In most of the parameter space, the predicted local non-Gaussianity is allowed by the current CMB limit [20] but can be detected by future observations of small scale structure [21, 22].\nOur scenario can somewhat mitigate the \u03b7\u2212problem; generically, there is no reason that the \u03b7 parameter of the inflaton is small [23\u201326]. In a curvaton scenario, a sufficiently small \u03b7 associated with the inflaton potential is still required so that slow-roll inflation can occur. But in a standard inflationary scenario, even smaller values of \u03b7 must hold to reproduce the observed small tilt of the perturbation spectrum. And while anthropic considerations might explain the \u03b7 necessary for inflation, it is hard to understand how they might motivate even smaller values of \u03b7. (See, however, [27\u201329].) Consistency with the observed spectral tilt will require the \u03b7 parameter of the curvaton itself to be smaller than O(0.01), but that can be understood by the approximate U(1) symmetry in our scenario.\nThe washout required in our scenario can occur from explicit breaking of the U(1) symmetry. In the case that the complex scalar is protected by a B + L symmetry, the washout can be due to the weak sphaleron process. If the relevant symmetry is the PQ symmetry, as would be the case for the axion, strong sphalerons could do the job. (As we will discuss, the washout actually involves a combination of processes, so that no remaining linear combination of approximate symmetries protects the rotation.) The washout rate is suppressed\nby the square of the ratio between the temperature and the radius of the rotation [17], so it is suppressed at early times but can become effective as the radius shrinks by redshifting.\nIn this paper, we discuss two well-motivated examples mentioned above, flat directions in the MSSM and a PQ symmetry breaking field. For the former, washout easily occurs since the radius of the rotation can become arbitrarily small, and the washout rate becomes larger than the Hubble expansion rate. For the latter, whether or not the washout is effective is non-trivial since the radius of rotation cannot be smaller than the axion decay constant. Also, in the time slice where the PQ charge is uniform, the axion field itself is not uniform. A consequence is that domain walls without boundaries may be produced from the fluctuation of the axion field. Such domain walls could lead to an unacceptable cosmology. The fluctuations can also produce matter isocurvature perturbations through misalignment [30\u201332] axion dark matter production. We argue how these problems can be avoided by the resultant symmetry restoration as arising from either thermal trapping after the washout or an era of parametric resonance in the early stage of the rotation.\nThe rotation has implications for the baryon asymmetry and dark matter. The U(1) charge of the MSSM flat directions can be converted into a baryon asymmetry through B\u2212L violating interactions [33\u201337]. The PQ charge in the axion rotation can be converted into a baryon asymmetry (axiogenesis) [17, 36, 38\u201342]. The kinetic energy of the axion rotation may also be the source of the axion dark matter density (kinetic misalignment) [43, 44]. Since the rotation dominates the energy density of the universe, and the entropy of the universe almost entirely comes from it, baryon and dark matter may be produced from the U(1) charge without producing matter isocurvature perturbations. In this scenario, three essential ingredients of the universe\u2014the dark matter, the baryon asymmetry, and the density fluctuations\u2014can all originate from the rotation of a complex field.\nOur mechanism requires a nearly quadratic potential for the radial direction of the complex field so that the rotation can dominate the universe. This is naturally realized in supersymmetric theories. Motivations of supersymmetry cannot be stressed too much; it is the unique extension of the space-time symmetry, achieves precise gauge coupling unification, relaxes the hierarchy problem, and provides the lightest supersymmetric particle as a dark matter candidate. We therefore perform our analysis in the context of supersymmetric theories, but the key idea can be applied to non-supersymmetric theories if the potential for the radial direction is nearly quadratic.\nCurvaton models that share some similarities with the present scenario have been investigated in the literature. For example, axion-like fields were proposed as curvaton candidates in order to understand the lightness of the curvaton [45\u201348]. However, in these works, the motion of the axion fields was not rotation but rather oscillation (as driven by the vacuum potential). For the axion-like curvaton field to dominate and decay, the required mass is much larger than that of the QCD axion, so the most well-motivated axion cannot do the job in that case. MSSM flat directions acting as curvatons are discussed in Refs. [49\u201352]. The possibility of producing cosmic perturbations from the fluctuation of the angular direction of a rotating complex field is discussed in Refs. [53, 54]. They, however, do not take into account the thermodynamical stability of the rotation, and in these scenarios the energy density of the angular mode is at the most comparable to that of the radial mode. This not only leads to non-Gaussianity that is too large unless the energy densities are comparable, but it also makes baryogenesis from the charge in the rotation impossible, as correlated baryon isocurvature perturbations become too large. Ref. [55] considers the generation of curvature perturbations from the decay of Q-balls created from the rotation. In this case, the energy density dominantly comes from the angular mode, and the non-Gaussianity is not too large. However, because of fluctuations in the Q-ball lifetimes, if dark matter or baryon are produced from Q-balls, correlated matter isocurvature perturbations are generically produced. We will discuss the conditions for avoiding Q-ball formation in our scenario.\nThis paper is organized as follows. The dynamics of rotating fields are reviewed in Sec. 2. We compute the spectrum of the curvature perturbations in Sec. 3. The case of the PQ symmetry breaking field is discussed in Sec. 4. Discussion including comments on baryogenesis from the rotation is given in Sec. 5. In the Appendices, we discuss the thermalization of rotating MSSM flat directions, provide details on the numerical computation of the charge density of the rotating field, and discuss cosmic strings that rotate in field space."

(2.1)\nWe assume that P has a (nearly) quadratic U(1) symmetric potential. As we will see, this allows the rotation to dominate the energy density of the universe and thus produce the curvature perturbations of the universe without generating too-large non-Gaussianity. Since the assumption is naturally realized in supersymmetric theories, we discuss the dynamics of rotations in the context of supersymmetric theories.\n2.1. Initiation of the rotation\nThe U(1) symmetry may be explicitly broken by a higher-dimensional operator in the\nsuperpotential1 that is negligible at the vacuum,\nW = P n+1\nMn\u22122 , (2.2)\nwhere M is a dimensionful parameter. The effect of such explicit U(1) breaking may be enhanced in the early universe, and it may initiate the rotation of P by the Affleck-Dine mechanism [9\u201311], which we review below.\nThe scalar potential of P is given by\nV = (n+ 1)2\nM2n\u22124 |P |2n +m2S|P |2 \u2212 cHH2|P |2 +\n( (n\u2212 2)a\nU(1) mS\nP n+1 Mn\u22122 + h.c.\n) , (2.3)\nwhere the first term is from the F term of P , the second term is from the supersymmetry breaking at the vacuum, the third term is from the supersymmetry breaking in the early universe, the so-called Hubble-induced mass, and the last term is from R symmetry breaking at the vacuum and the superpotential in Eq. (2.2), the so-called A term. The constant a U(1) is expected to be O(m3/2/mS), with mS the mass of the radial mode of P and m3/2 the gravitino mass. If the soft mass of S is given by gravity mediation, a U(1) = O(1) is expected.\nAssuming a positive cH >\u223c O(1) during inflation, the radial direction of P is fixed at a\nlarge field value where the first and the third terms balance,\n|P | =\n[ c\n1/2 H HinfM n\u22122 n1/2(n+ 1)\n] 1 n\u22121\n, (2.4)\n1 U(1) symmetry breaking in the Ka\u0308hler potential can also initiate the rotation [56]. For this case, however,\nthe field value of P must be around the cutoff scale for the initiation of the rotation to be effective, and\ntheoretical control is lost. In particular, the angular direction can obtain a mass as large as the Hubble\nscale and may not obtain fluctuations.\nwhere Hinf is the Hubble scale during inflation. For Hinf mS, the mass of the angular direction given by the last term in Eq. (2.3) is much smaller than Hinf , and the angular direction obtains fluctuations. As we will see in the next section, the fluctuations can produce the observed curvature perturbations of the Universe.\nAfter inflation, P is no longer fixed at the field value in Eq. (2.4) but evolves as the Hubble scale changes. During this period, the inflaton oscillates around the minimum of its potential and eventually decays into radiation. We assume that the thermal potential of P is negligible when its rotation is initiated, which is the case when the field value of P is large and/or the reheat temperature following inflation is small enough. We also assume that after inflation, cH remains positive, or negative but is smaller than O(1). Then the radial direction follows an attractor solution as long as mS H [11, 57],\n|P | = 3(1 + w)HMn\u22122 2n1/2(n+ 1) ( 4cH 9(1 + w)2 +\n2 (n\u2212 1)(1 + w) \u2212 n (n\u2212 1)2\n)1 2  1n\u22121 , (2.5) where w = 1/3 for radiation domination and 0 for matter domination.\nWhen 3H becomes comparable to mS, oscillations in P are induced by the vacuum potential. At the same time, the last term in Eq. (2.3) gives a kick to P in the angular direction, and P begins to rotate around the origin. Because of cosmic expansion, the field value of P decreases, and shortly after the beginning of the rotation, the explicit U(1) breaking potential becomes negligible. P then continues to rotate while preserving the angular momentum in field space (the U(1) charge density) up to the dilution by cosmic expansion,\nn\u03b8 = i(P\u0307P \u2217 \u2212 P\u0307 \u2217P ) = \u2212\u03b8\u0307S2 \u221d R\u22123, (2.6)\nwhere R is the scale factor of the universe. The above dynamics can be explicitly seen from the equation for n\u03b8,\nn\u0307\u03b8 + 3Hn\u03b8 = \u2202V\n\u2202\u03b8 , (2.7)\nwhere the right-hand side is responsible for the kick.\nIt is convenient to normalize the charge density by the entropy density s,\nY\u03b8 \u2261 n\u03b8 s , (2.8)\nsince Y\u03b8 remains constant as long as entropy is conserved. We may evaluate Y\u03b8 in the following way. The potential gradient in the angular direction is about a U(1) times that in the radial direction when the rotation is initiated at 3H ' mS; see Eqs. (2.3) and (2.5). Therefore, the kick induces \u03b8\u0307 ' a U(1) mS. Here we assume that the initial angle is not close to the minimum nor the maximum of the potential generated by the explicit breaking term. Then the U(1) charge density at the time of the initiation of the rotation is about a U(1) mSS 2 i , where Si is the field value of S when the rotation begins. The resultant Y\u03b8 is given by\nY\u03b8 ' 50a U(1) ( 100 TeV mS )1 2 ( Si 1016 GeV )2 (200 g\u2217 )1 4 : TR & 1011 GeV ( mS 100 TeV )1 2 ( 200 g\u2217 )1 4\n4a U(1)\n( TR\n1010 GeV ) ( 100 TeV mS ) ( Si 1016 GeV )2 : TR . 1011 GeV ( mS 100 TeV )1 2 ( 200 g\u2217 )1 4 . (2.9)\nHere TR is the reheat temperature after inflation, and we assume that no entropy is produced after the completion of the reheating by the inflaton. (The case with entropy production from the radial mode of P is discussed in Appendix A.) The first (second) expression corresponds to the case where the rotation begins after (before) the completion of the reheating. Y\u03b8 for the second case can be estimated by first computing the redshift-invariant ratio n\u03b8/\u03c1inf with \u03c1inf the inflaton energy density. This ratio can be computed straightforwardly at the onset of the rotation and can then be converted to n\u03b8/s at the completion of reheating.\n2.2. Evolution of the rotation\nThe evolution of the rotation after its initiation is discussed in Ref. [17]. At first, the rotation contains both radial and angular motion. The rotation is thermalized via its interaction with the thermal bath. The radial mode is dissipated, but because of U(1) charge conservation, the angular mode is nearly unaffected; while some U(1) charge is transferred into particle-antiparticle asymmetries in the thermal bath, it is free-energetically favorable to keep almost all of the charge in the form of rotation as long as the U(1) charge density is larger than mST 2 [17, 18]. This can be seen in the following way. The chemical potential of the rotation is \u03b8\u0307, so in equilibrium, the chemical potential of the U(1) charge asymmetry of the bath is also O(\u03b8\u0307). The result is that the bath asymmetry is O(\u03b8\u0307T 2), which is suppressed relative to the charge in the rotation n\u03b8 = \u2212\u03b8\u0307S2\u2014this proves the thermodynamic stability of the rotation. The angular motion is retained; the result is nearly circular motion without ellipticity. Eventually, the charge can be washed out by explicit breaking of the U(1)\nsymmetry, as discussed in Sec. 2.4. Here we discuss the evolution well before the washout.\nWhen the motion is circular, the equation of motion of S requires that\n\u03b8\u03072 = V \u2032(S)\nS , (2.10)\nwhich is as large as m2S. Charge conservation requires n\u03b8 \u221d R\u22123. Thus, for the quadratic potential at hand, the evolution of \u03b8\u0307, S, and the energy density of the rotation \u03c1\u03b8 is\n\u03b8\u0307 \u221d R0, S2 \u221d R\u22123, \u03c1\u03b8 \u221d R\u22123. (2.11)\nThe energy density of the rotation redshifts more slowly than radiation (R\u22123 vs. R\u22124), and it can come to dominate the energy density of the universe. The temperature at which this transition from radiation to matter domination occurs is\nTRM = 4\n3 mSY\u03b8 ' 130 TeV ( mS TeV )( Y\u03b8 100 ) . (2.12)\nDynamics of the rotation is extensively investigated in [17, 36, 41, 43, 58, 59] for a PQ symmetry breaking field\u2014including the thermalization of the radial mode and possible entropy production from it\u2014and it is found that the circular rotation can indeed dominate the universe [59] for a wide range of interesting parameters. In Appendix A, we demonstrate that rotations of MSSM flat directions can similarly come to dominate. There, we also discuss the case where the rotation dominates the universe before the completion of the thermalization.\nNote that Eq. (2.10) relates \u03b8\u0307 and S, so one variable is sufficient to specify the state of the rotation. As we will see, n\u03b8 is a convenient variable to compute the curvature perturbations produced from the rotation.\n2.3. Q-ball formation and parametric resonance\nIn the above discussion, we assumed that the rotation is coherent. We now discuss two processes that can create inhomogeneities in P : Q-ball formation and parametric resonance. We find that the possibility of Q-ball formation can place non-trivial constraints on the potential of the flat direction. Parametric resonance, on the other hand, is not problematic but will play an important role in the case where the rotation of the PQ field is the curvaton.\nA purely quadratic potential of S is at the boundary of the condition for Q-ball formation, so small perturbations to the potential could lead to Q-balls. Indeed, the potential of S is not\npurely quadratic but receives a logarithmic correction Km2S|P |2ln|P |2 because of quantum corrections. If K < 0, Q-balls may form [60\u201364]. If Q-balls come to dominate the energy density of the universe, they will induce too-large isocurvature perturbations if the baryon asymmetry is produced by the rotation, as explained in Sec. 3. (See [55] for the case of Q-ball formation with naturally compensated isocurvature perturbations.) For the PQ symmetrybreaking field, K > 0 can be achieved by the Yukawa coupling between P and other fields, such as KSVZ (Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov) [65, 66] quarks, that have positive scalar soft mass squared. For MSSM flat directions, requiring K > 0 restricts the possible choice of the flat directions depending on the mass spectrum, as the quantum corrections from the gaugino masses and gauge interactions make negative contributions to K. For scalar masses mS \u223c m\u03bb with m\u03bb the gaugino masses, if the flat direction contains Q3 or u\u03043, the corrections from the top Yukawa and scalar masses can dominate K, ensuring K > 0. For large tan\u03b2, d\u03043, e\u03043, and L3 also work. For scalar masses mS > 10m\u03bb (natural because of the chiral symmetry that can suppress gaugino masses) as indeed occurs in the withoutsinglet scenario [67], even flat directions that exclusively include the first and the second generations can have K > 0 since the logarithmic correction to the S potential from the gaugino masses are suppressed by (m\u03bb/mS) 2, while the two-loop corrections from the gauge interactions and scalar masses [68] can generate positive K = 10\u22124 and 10\u22123 for non-colored and colored scalars, respectively. But even in the case where K > 0, thermal corrections could, in principle, also lead to production of Q-balls. However, as is shown in Appendix A, such thermally produced Q-balls disappear by the time the circular rotation dominates the universe, and the analyses in the following sections are unaffected. In summary, production of Q-balls from a thermal potential is harmless, and Q-balls produced from the vacuum potential\u2014that might give dangerous isocurvature perturbations\u2014can be avoided by the choice of flat direction or the superpartner spectrum.\nThere is another process that can create inhomogeneities in P . Even for a logarithmic potential with a positive K, before thermalization when the rotation has non-zero ellipticity, fluctuations of P around the rotating background grow [36, 44] via parametric resonance [69\u2013 73]. If the thermalization occurs after parametric resonance is efficient, the amplitude of the fluctuations of P becomes as large as the zero mode amplitude.\nParametric resonance, however, does not affect production of the curvature perturbations discussed in Sec. 3. Even if large fluctuations are produced by parametric resonance, they\nare limited to sub-horizon scales since the super-horizon modes do not have instability. This means parametric resonance leaves unaffected\u2014on the super-horizon scales\u2014both the U(1) charge density n\u03b8 and fluctuations imprinted in it during inflation. Moreover, once thermalization occurs, P becomes homogeneous within the Hubble horizon, and since the horizon size at this time is much larger than the inverse of the frequency of the rotation \u03b8\u0307\u22121, the gradient term is negligible in the dynamics of the rotation. The energy density of the rotation evolves as in the coherent case. Nevertheless, as we will see in Sec. 4.3, parametric resonance plays a crucial role in avoiding isocurvature and domain wall problems when the U(1) symmetry is the PQ symmetry.\n2.4. Entropy production from the rotation\nIn order for the rotation to act as a curvaton, the energy density of the rotation must be transferred into the bath. Indeed, the U(1) charge in the rotation can be slowly washed out via explicit breaking of the U(1) symmetry and produce entropy. For washout to occur, all (approximate) symmetries that protect the charge must be explicitly broken.\nTo illustrate this, consider a toy model of QCD with two flavors u and d where the U(1) symmetry has a QCD anomaly. The Boltzmann equations governing the charge density are\nn\u0307u = \u2212\u03b3unu \u2212 \u03b3ss ( nu + nd \u2212 1\n2 \u03b8\u0307T 2 ) n\u0307d = \u2212\u03b3dnd \u2212 \u03b3ss ( nu + nd \u2212 1\n2 \u03b8\u0307T 2 ) n\u0307\u03b8 = \u2212\u03b3ss ( nu + nd \u2212 1\n2 \u03b8\u0307T 2\n) . (2.13)\nHere nu and nd are chiral asymmetry of u and d, respectively, and \u03b3u,d and \u03b3ss are the chiral symmetry breaking rates arising from the masses of u, d and the strong sphaleron processes,\n\u03b3u,d ' \u03b13m2u,d/T, \u03b3ss ' 100\u03b153T. (2.14)\nSolving for nu,d by taking n\u0307u,d = 0 and substituting them into the equation for n\u0307\u03b8, we obtain\nn\u0307\u03b8 = \u2212 ( \u03b3\u22121u + \u03b3 \u22121 d + \u03b3 \u22121 ss )\u22121 T 2 2S2 n\u03b8 \u2261 \u2212\u03b3\u03b8n\u03b8, (2.15)\nwhere we have used n\u03b8 = \u2212S2\u03b8\u0307. One can see that the washout rate for n\u03b8 vanishes if the up- or down-quark mass is zero despite the explicit U(1) symmetry breaking by the QCD\nanomaly. This is because a linear combination of the U(1) symmetry and a quark chiral symmetry remains exact in the massless quark limit. Hence, the washout rate of the U(1) charge \u03b3\u03b8 is roughly given by\n\u03b3\u03b8 ' min(\u03b3u, \u03b3d, \u03b3ss)\u00d7 T 2\n2S2 . (2.16)\nThat is, the washout rate is given by the rate of the bottleneck process times a further suppression factor T 2/(2S2). This additional suppression comes from the smallness of the chiral asymmetries nu,d at the quasi-equilibrium state, nu,d \u223c \u03b8\u0307T 2 \u223c n\u03b8T 2/(2S2).\nGoing beyond our toy model, washout generically requires all linear combinations of the U(1) symmetry with other symmetries be explicitly broken. As an example, consider the u\u03041u\u03042d\u03042e\u03041 supersymmetric flat direction with S > T , which completely breaks SU(3)c\u00d7U(1)Y . This breaking means that the strong sphaleron rate is exponentially suppressed, so that the chiral symmetries of u\u03041, u\u03042, and d\u03041 are broken only by yu, yc, and yd, respectively. The e\u03041 chiral symmetry is broken by ye. (The chiral symmetry breaking rates are given by y 2S2/T rather than by y2T , assuming yS < T .) B + L is broken by the weak sphaleron process. L1 \u2212 L2 and L1 \u2212 L3 can be broken by slepton mixing. B1 \u2212 B2 and B1 \u2212 B3 are broken by the CKM mixing and/or squark mixing. The PQ (an approximate symmetry in the MSSM in the limit of \u00b5 = 0) and R symmetry must be also broken, since otherwise a linear combination of these symmetries and B+L remains unbroken. The PQ symmetry is broken by the \u00b5 or B\u00b5 term, while the R symmetry is broken by the gaugino mass, the B\u00b5 term, or A terms. The washout rate will be controlled by the minimum of all these breakings. A similar story holds for QQQL directions, but in this case, since the SU(2)L gauge symmetry is broken by the flat direction, effective B + L violation by weak sphalerons can occur only for small S; see the discussion below for the modification of the washout rate for this case.\nSome of the MSSM flat directions have non-zero B\u2212L charges. For this case, the washout of the B \u2212 L charge can be achieved by R-parity violation or light right-handed neutrinos. The curvaton could also be a flat direction with neither B nor L charge but with flavor charges, such as Q1u\u03042L1e\u03042. Washout of the flavor charges can occur via yc, y\u00b5, 1-2 squark or CKM mixing, and 1-2 slepton mixing. This flat direction also has non-vanishing PQ and R charge, so the \u00b5 or B\u00b5 term and a source of R-symmetry breaking are also required.\nIn all cases, the washout may be initially ineffective because of the rate suppression at large S, and the rotation is stable. However, as S decreases the washout becomes effective\nand the entropy production from the rotation begins. The temperature of the universe during the entropy production is given by\nT 4 \u223c \u03c1\u03b8 \u03b3\u03b8 H . (2.17)\nSince this equation depends on T , \u03c1(n\u03b8), S(n\u03b8), and H(\u03c1\u03b8(n\u03b8), T ), the temperature T after the entropy production begins is determined as a function of n\u03b8. The uniform energy density slice is therefore the uniform n\u03b8 slice. As we will see in Sec. 3, this enables the computation of the curvature perturbation via the \u03b4N formalism [74\u201376] using the uniform n\u03b8 slice. The rotation is completely washed out once \u03b3\u03b8 becomes larger than H.\nThe above estimation of the washout rate implicitly assumes mS < T . As discussed in Sec. 2.2, the rotation provides chemical potentials to particles in the thermal bath \u00b5bath \u223c \u03b8\u0307 = mS. So for mS < T , the distribution of particles in the thermal bath is nearly identical to one with \u00b5bath = 0, and the energy density of the thermal bath as a whole and the typical energy of particles are not affected by the presence of the rotation. However, if washout does not occur before T drops below mS, the energy density of the bath is affected by the presence of the large chemical potential. Indeed, the energy density of the bath with T \u00b5bath is kept at \u03c1bath \u223c \u00b54bath \u223c m4S and the typical energy of particles in the thermal bath at O(mS). This deviation from the standard scaling of the energy density of radiation \u221d R\u22124 is due to significant energy transfer from the rotation to the bath. We emphasize that this occurs even for U(1) charge-conserving (not washout) processes. The radiation energy of the universe dominantly comes from the rotation, and the uniform-n\u03b8 slice is again a uniform energy density slice. The U(1) charge should ultimately be washed out, so that the universe eventually reverts to a standard radiation-dominated universe. To find the washout rate in this phase, we may replace T with mS in our earlier estimate of the washout rate. In this phase, prior to washout, the temperature drops in proportion to R\u22123, as can be seen from the entropy density \u221d \u00b52bathT \u223c m2ST , so T becomes much smaller than mS.2\nIf the washout rate is sufficiently small, S may drop belowmS(> T ) before the U(1) charge is washed out. For example, the washout of QQQL involving non-perturbative processes of the weak interaction is ineffective for S > \u00b5bath \u223c mS [77, 78], and so this stage is reached. In this stage, the chemical potential of the system is no longer kept at O(mS); since the\n2 The decrease of the temperature can be slower because of the entropy production from the partial washout\nof the rotation.\nU(1) charge in the rotation of P does not dominate the total charge, a fixed \u00b5bath \u223c mS would mean that the total U(1) charge would not decrease in proportion to R\u22123, which is in contradiction with charge conservation. Thus, the chemical potential must decrease. Since the temperature and the chemical potential become smaller than mS, the abundance of P (and hence the field value of P ) is exponentially suppressed, and the U(1) charge is mostly stored in the particle-antiparticle asymmetry of particles lighter than mS, such as SM particles. The temperature as well as the chemical potential decrease in proportion to R\u22121. The universe is dominated by radiation. The factor T 2/S2 in the washout rate is absent. At this point, if P is an MSSM flat direction, since there is no suppression of the washout rate by a large field value of S, the washout of the U(1) charge is effective and the chemical potentials will eventually vanish.3 Note that once P relaxes to a smaller field value, the weak gauge symmetry is restored, and the non-perturbative B + L-violating processes no longer receive an exponential suppression."

            "text": "During inflation, the angular direction \u03b8 remains nearly massless. As is the case for any massless field [12\u201316], inflation imprints fluctuations along the \u03b8 direction [82\u201384], and the fluctuation \u03b4\u03b8(x) follows a Gaussian distribution with a width Hinf/(2\u03c0Sinf). The fluctuation in the angular direction leads to the fluctuation of the magnitude of the kick discussed in the previous section. This, in turn, leads to variations in the charge density n\u03b8. In this section, we discuss how the curvature perturbations of the universe arise from the fluctuation of n\u03b8.\n3.1. Curvature perturbations\nWe compute the spectrum of the curvature perturbations with the \u03b4N formalism [74\u201376], which relies on a computation of the number of e-foldings, N , between an initial flat time slice and a final uniform-density slice. The fluctuations in the number of e-foldings between these slices \u03b4N(x) give the curvature perturbations \u03b6(x).\n3 Exceptions are lepton flavor charges Li\u2212Lj , whose washout may be ineffective if the slepton mass matrices\nare very nearly diagonal. See [42] for the estimation of the washout rate involving sfermion mixing. This would result in YLi\u2212Lj \u223c 1/g\u2217 \u223c 0.01, until they are washed out by the neutrino oscillation at 1-10 MeV [79, 80]. The large lepton flavor charge leads to non-zero baryon asymmetry even if B \u2212L = 0 [81].\nWe take the initial flat time slice ti at a time where the energy is dominated by the inflaton (or the radiation produced by it) and the U(1) charge is conserved. In this slicing, the U(1) charge has spatial fluctuations that originate from the fluctuation of the initial value of the angular direction produced during inflation; recall the U(1) charge is created by the kick to the angular direction whose magnitude depends on the angle, see Eqs. (2.3) and (2.7). Fluctuations that are observable in the CMB and large scale structure formation correspond to long-wavelength modes, and so the evolution of the charge density is unaffected by gradients in the energy density. Spatial fluctuations are therefore completely determined by the initial value of the angular direction \u03b8i before the initiation of the rotation, so we can parameterize the charge density by\nn\u03b8(ti,x) \u2261 ni(\u03b8i(x)). (3.1)\nSince the radiation density of the universe is eventually dominated by that created from the (partial) washout of the rotation, see Eq. (2.17), a slice with uniform charge will give a slice with uniform energy density. We therefore take the final slice tf to be a uniform charge slice,\nn\u03b8(tf ,x) = n\u03b8(tf ). (3.2)\nThe number of e-foldings between the two slices, N , is given by\nn\u03b8(ti,x)\u00d7 exp(\u22123N(ti, tf ,x)) = n\u03b8(tf ). (3.3)\nCurvature perturbations are given by the variation of N between the two time slices [74\u201376]:\n\u03b6(x) = \u03b4N(x) = 1\n3 \u03b4ln(ni(\u03b8i(x))) =\n1 3 n\u2032i ni \u03b4\u03b8(x) + nin \u2032\u2032 i \u2212 n\u20322i 6n2i (\u03b4\u03b8(x))2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (3.4)\nwhere the primes denote the derivative with respect to \u03b8i. From the fluctuation \u03b4\u03b8 \u223c Hinf/(2\u03c0Sinf), we obtain a power spectrum of the curvature perturbations\nP\u03b6(k) = ( n\u2032i 3ni )2( Hinf(k) 2\u03c0Sinf(k) )2 . (3.5)\nThe observed value is P\u03b6(k) = 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22129 at k = 0.05 (Mpc)\u22121 [85], so the inflation scale may be related to the value of S during inflation Sinf and the charge density as\nHinf ' 9\u00d7 1011 GeV (\nSinf 1016 GeV\n)( 10\n(n\u2032i/3ni) 2\n)1 2 . (3.6)\nStarting with the potential in Eq. (2.3), the dependence of the function ni on \u03b8i can be evaluated analytically in the limit where the kick in the angular direction is weak (a U(1) 1 or a \u03b8i close to an integer multiple of \u03c0/(n + 1)) and the ellipticity of the rotation is large. In this case, the right-hand side of Eq. (2.7) can be treated perturbatively, neglecting the change of the angle around the time of the initiation. We then find\nlim a U(1)\u21920\nni(\u03b8i) \u221d \u2202V\n\u2202\u03b8i \u221d sin((n+ 1)\u03b8i). (3.7)\nIn this limit,\nlim a U(1)\u21920 ( n\u2032i 3ni )2 = (n+ 1)2 cos2 ((n+ 1)\u03b8i) 9 sin2 ((n+ 1)\u03b8i) . (3.8)\nNote the enhancement of the fluctuation for large n.\nIf the kick is strong and the rotation becomes nearly circular, analytical evaluation is difficult. In this regime, we employ a numerical computation as described in Appendix B. The resultant value of (n\u2032i/3ni) 2 is shown in Fig. 1 for several reference points. As the kick becomes weak, the result approaches the analytical approximation, while for a U(1) = O(1), the deviation becomes significant. When (n+ 1)\u03b8i/\u03c0 is close to an integer, the kick is weak for all values of a U(1) and the analytical approximation works well. Other non-trivial features of the curves can be understood from ni(\u03b8i) in Fig. 3, which is described in Appendix B. In particular, for a U(1) close to unity, the angular direction oscillates before the rotation begins and ni(\u03b8i) non-trivially depends on \u03b8i. In these figures, it is assumed that the universe is radiation dominated when the rotation is initiated, but the case with matter domination is qualitatively similar. Here we take n = 7, which corresponds to the MSSM flat directions lifted by W = (u\u0304u\u0304d\u0304e\u0304)2, (QQQL)2, (Qu\u0304Qd\u0304)2, (Qu\u0304Le\u0304)2 [19]. For larger n with a fixed a U(1) , the kick becomes stronger (see Eq. (B.3)), so the deviation from Eq. (3.8) becomes larger.\nWe now comment on the case with Q-ball formation discussed in Sec. 2.3 and the impact of such Q-balls on perturbations. When the potential of S is flatter than a quadratic one, fluctuations around the rotation have instability modes. Q-balls form when the growth rate of the fluctuations by the instability becomes comparable to the Hubble expansion rate, which means that the total energy density of the universe when this condition holds is fixed.4 If the production occurs before the circular rotation comes to dominate, the uniform-\n4 If the potential of S is significantly is different from the quadratic one (e.g., the thermal log potential and\ngauge-mediated contributions above the mediation scale), the growth rate can depend on n\u03b8. Still, when the growth rate becomes comparable to the Hubble expansion rate is not uniquely determined by n\u03b8, so the modulated reheating contribution discussed below persists.\ndensity slice does not coincide with the uniform-n\u03b8 slice, so n\u03b8 fluctuates when the Q-balls form. The charge of Q-balls depends on n\u03b8 when they are produced [62, 86\u201388] so also fluctuates. The lifetime of the Q-balls, which is regulated by the Pauli-blocking near their surface [89], depends on the charge, so the lifetime of the Q-balls also fluctuates. When the Q-balls evaporate, this induces extra curvature perturbations [55], as in the modulated reheating scenario [90, 91].5 Although there is no problem in this scenario as far as the curvature perturbations are concerned, if the baryon asymmetry is also produced from the rotation, this extra source of curvature perturbations leads to too-large correlated baryon isocurvature perturbations. As we discussed in Sec. 2.3, the vacuum potential does not support the Q-ball solution for a class of MSSM flat directions and PQ symmetry breaking fields.\nHowever, even if the vacuum potential does not allow for the Q-ball solution, the ther5 If the microscopic decay rate of the Q-ball constituents is much smaller than the evaporation rate (not the\ncase for MSSM flat directions in gravity mediation), the Q-ball decay rate is determined by the microscopic\none, and the modulated reheating effect is absent. Still, if the S potential significantly deviates from a\nquadratic one, as in gauge mediation, the energy per charge can depend on the charge of Q-balls [92]; this\nmay create extra curvature perturbations.\nmal potential may. As we discuss in Appendix A, however, such thermally induced Q-balls disappear by the time the rotation would dominate the universe. After the Q-balls disappear, the rotation becomes nearly homogeneous again, and the above analysis is applicable. Therefore, vacuum potentials that do not admit Q-ball formation, such as those identified in Sec. 2.3, will be free of the isocurvature problem discussed above.\n3.2. Spectral index\nThe spectral index in the rotating case is given by ns = 1\u2212 2 ( n\u2212 2 n\u2212 1 ) + 2\u03b7\u03b8\u03b8, \u03b7\u03b8\u03b8 = V\u03b8\u03b8 S2infH 2 inf , (3.9) where is the first slow-roll parameter of the inflaton. This is similar to the usual curvaton scenario, but with an extra factor (n \u2212 2)/(n \u2212 1), which comes from the dependence of Sinf on Hinf . The observed spectral index ns = 0.9665 \u00b1 0.0038 [85] requires that ' 0.02 or \u03b7\u03b8\u03b8 ' \u22120.02. The former requires large field inflation models [93]. The latter would require explicit U(1) breaking. This cannot originate from the a U(1) term in Eq. (2.3); the mass of the angular direction there is comparable to the Hubble scale at the time of the kick (3H ' mS) and is much smaller than the Hubble scale during inflation.6 An extra U(1)-breaking is necessary.\nAn extra U(1)-breaking potential may be provided by an extra U(1)-breaking term in either the super- or Ka\u0308hler-potential. The resultant U(1)-breaking potential must be of higher power in P than that in Eq. (2.3), so that the U(1) breaking is negligible by the time P begins rotation while it can give \u03b7\u03b8\u03b8 \u223c \u22120.01 during inflation.\nAlternately, explicit U(1) breaking may be provided from an extra A term associated with the superpotential term in Eq. (2.2) from coupling to the inflaton sector. Such a term, namely, a Hubble-induced A term, readily arises in inflation models without an R symmetry. Even for R-symmetric models, a Hubble-induced A term can arise from spontaneous R symmetry breaking in the inflaton sector and the Ka\u0308hler potential\nK = 1\nM2\u2217 ZZ\u2020PP \u2020, (3.10)\n6 While this is not the case if the Hubble scale during inflation is not much above mS , to explain the\nmagnitude of the curvature perturbations, the required Sinf is small (see Eq. (3.5)). In this case the rotation cannot dominate the universe unless mS is above 10 9 GeV.\nwhere Z is a chiral multiplet whose F term (= \u221a\n3HinfMPl) is responsible for the inflaton\npotential with MPl the reduced Planck mass, and M\u2217 is the cut-off scale. The resultant A term potential is as large as\nnZinf HinfMPl M2\u2217\nP n+1 Mn\u22122 + h.c. (3.11)\nThe axion mass from this A term is O(0.1)Hinf if n3/2ZinfMPl/M2\u2217 is O(0.01). Here we use Eq. (2.4) to evaluate the field value of P . For example, for M\u2217 \u223c MPl and n = 10, the required Zinf is O(0.001)MPl and is much below the Planck scale. Because of the smallness, the extra A term of the required size can be easily obtained even in small field inflation models such as new inflation and hybrid inflation. The required Zinf is even smaller if M\u2217 is below the Planck scale. Note that, however, the Hubble induced A term can increase during inflation if Zinf increases during inflation. If the axion mass from the Hubble induced A-term becomes as large as the Hubble scale, the fluctuation of the angular direction is damped and the curvature perturbation cannot be explained. Also, if the R symmetry is (approximately) continuous, a linear combination of the phase degree of freedom of the inflaton and the axion remains massless. In order to obtain \u03b7\u03b8\u03b8 \u223c \u22120.01, the massless direction must be dominantly the inflaton component. We leave the investigation of the compatibility of our scenario with various inflation models for future work.\n3.3. Non-Gaussianity\nJust like the case of the oscillating curvaton, the curvature perturbations created from the axion rotation have non-Gaussianity of the local type. The local non-Gaussianity parameter fNL is defined by\n\u03b6(x) ' g(x) + 3 5 fNL \u00d7 g(x)2, (3.12)\nwhere g(x) follows a gaussian distribution. Comparing this with Eq. (3.4), we obtain\nfNL = \u2212 5\n2\n( 1\u2212 nin \u2032\u2032 i\nn\u20322i\n) . (3.13)\nThe non-Gaussianity becomes large as n\u2032i approaches 0, since small n \u2032 means that the first order,Gaussian part of \u03b6 becomes small and the second order part that leads to non-Gaussianity is relatively enhanced. This is in contrast to the curvaton from an oscillating field with a\nmass term, where fNL = \u22125/4 when the curvaton dominates, and larger |fNL| requires that the curvaton is subdominant when it decays.\nIn the limit of weak kick, fNL can be analytically obtained using Eq. (3.7),\nlim a U(1)\u21920\nfNL = \u2212 5\n2 cos2 ((n+ 1)\u03b8i) \u2264 \u22122.5. (3.14)\nThis is consistent with the bound from the observations of the CMB, fNL = \u22120.9 \u00b1 5.1 (68% C.L.) [20] for a majority of \u03b8i, and can be detected via future observations of small scale structures [21, 22] that are sensitive to O(1) fNL. A numerical evaluation of fNL for several reference points are given in Fig. 2. When the kick is strong, it largely deviates from the elliptical case, but the magnitude of fNL is generically O(1) or larger, although it can be much smaller for a fine-tuned \u03b8i for a U(1) \u223c 1. Note that the sign of fNL can be positive for a U(1) \u223c 1, but only for a small range of \u03b8i. Here we take n = 7. As mentioned before, a larger n corresponds to a larger kick for fixed a U(1) , which means that the deviation from the analytical estimation in Eq. (3.14) becomes larger. The conclusion that a sizable fNL is produced for all but perhaps a small range of \u03b8i is robust to the choice of n."

            "text": "Having discussed general dynamics of rotating fields and how perturbations are induced in this scenario, we now discuss the case where a rotating axion acts as a curvaton. The explicit breaking in Eq. (2.2) is expected in theories where the PQ symmetry arises as an accidental symmetry [94\u201398]. Most of the discussion for generic complex fields is applicable to the PQ symmetry breaking field, but here we discuss few differences arising from the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry at the vacuum.\n4.1. Nearly quadratic potential and kination phase\nThus far we have assumed a nearly quadratic potential at large S. For a PQ breaking field, this may be explicitly realized in different ways. For example, the potential may be given by the supersymmetry breaking soft mass of P that is positive at UV but becomes negative at IR by renormalization group running [99],\nV (P ) = m2S|P |2 ( ln 2|P |2 f 2a \u2212 1 ) . (4.1)\nAnother example is a model with two PQ symmetry breaking fields P and P\u0304 ,\nW = X(PP\u0304 \u2212 v2P ), Vsoft = m2P |P |2 +m2P\u0304 |P\u0304 | 2, (4.2)\nwhere X is a chiral field whose F -term fixes P and P\u0304 on the moduli space PP\u0304 = v2P . For P vP or P\u0304 vP , the saxion potential is again nearly quadratic with mS ' mP or mP\u0304 , respectively. However, the latter model has difficulty in avoiding a domain-wall problem as we will see in Sec. 4.3.\nIn these models, Eq. (2.10) and n\u03b8 \u221d R\u22123 require that [17] \u03b8\u0307 \u221d R0 S2 \u221d R\u22123 : S fa,\n\u03c1\u03b8 \u221d R\u22123\n \u03b8\u0307 \u221d R\u22123 S2 \u221d R0 : S ' fa.\n\u03c1\u03b8 \u221d R\u22126\n(4.3)\nUnlike the case where the U(1) symmetry is not spontaneously broken at the vacuum, the rotation eventually evolves as kination (\u03c1\u03b8 \u221d R\u22126) and redshifts faster than radiation does. Therefore, the PQ charge does not have to be washed out completely\u2014cosmic expansion\nwill eventually make the axion rotation subdominant. To successfully act as a curvaton, it is enough that the entropy of the universe dominantly comes from the washout of the rotation.\nThe kination domination preceded by matter domination imprints a peculiar signal on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves [59, 100, 101] because it changes the expansion history of the universe relative to the standard radiation-dominated universe. In our setup, because of the entropy production from the rotation, gravitational waves at high frequencies are suppressed in comparison with the spectrum shown in these references, leaving a different signature. Also, Refs. [59, 100, 101] assumed that the PQ charge of the axion rotation decreases only by redshifting. As a result, unless the kination domination ends at a sufficiently high temperature, the axion rotation overproduces axion dark matter by kinetic misalignment [43]. This puts a lower bound on the frequency of the gravitational waves that can be affected by the kination domination. If the axion rotation is mostly washed out, this lower bound can be relaxed or removed.\n4.2. Washout of PQ charge\nAccording to the generic discussion in Sec. 2.4, the washout rate is given by the smallest of the strong sphaleron rate and chiral symmetry breaking rates times T 2/S2. However, unlike MSSM flat directions, S stops decreasing once it reaches S = fa and the washout of the rotation is not guaranteed. Indeed, if the up-quark chiral symmetry is broken only by the up Yukawa coupling yu as in the SM, scattering involving this coupling can provide the bottleneck process, and hence the washout rate is given by\n\u03b3\u03b8 ' \u03b13y2u T 3\nS2 . (4.4)\nSince yu is small and S stops decreasing at fa, the axion rotation cannot produce entropy and therefore cannot act as the curvaton. The chiral symmetry breaking rate may be, however, larger in theories beyond the SM. For example, squark mixing in the MSSM can lead to more effective washout, and consequently, entropy production from the rotation [42].\n4.3. Fluctuations of the axion field\nAlthough the energy density of the rotation is homogeneous in the uniform-n\u03b8 time slice as discussed in Sec. 2.2, the angle \u03b8 may not be so. If fluctuations in \u03b8 are too large, domain\nwall and isocurvature problems can arise.\nWe now calculate the fluctuations in \u03b8. The change in the angle from an initial time to\nthe final time tf is\n\u2206\u03b8 = \u222b tf \u03b8\u0307dt = \u222b n\u03b8(tf ) n\u03b8 S2 dn\u03b8 n\u0307\u03b8 = \u22121 3 \u222b n\u03b8(tf ) dn\u03b8 HS2 . (4.5)\nIn the epoch prior to washout, H is not uniquely determined by n\u03b8. That means that in this integration, H fluctuates. This leads to a fluctuation of \u03b8 produced per Hubble time of\n\u03b4\u03b8 \u223c n\u03b8 S2 \u03b4H H2 = \u03b8\u0307 H \u03b4H H \u223c \u03b8\u0307 H \u03b4\u03c1tot \u03c1tot , (4.6)\nwhere \u03c1tot is the total energy density of the universe and \u03b4\u03c1tot is its fluctuation defined on the uniform-n\u03b8 slice, for which \u03b4\u03c1tot = \u03b4\u03c1rad. Using entropy conservation \u03b4s/s = const, one can see that \u03b4\u03c1tot/\u03c1tot \u221d \u03c1rad/\u03c1tot. Therefore, before the rotation dominates, \u03b8\u0307/H \u221d R2 and \u03b4\u03c1tot/\u03c1tot \u221d R0. After the rotation dominates but before behaving as kination, \u03b8\u0307/H \u221d R3/2 and \u03b4\u03c1tot/\u03c1tot \u221d R\u22121. During kination domination, \u03b8\u0307/H \u221d R0 and \u03b4\u03c1tot/\u03c1tot \u221d R2. The fluctuation produced per Hubble time is larger at later times.\nWhat is the minimum possible value of \u03b4\u03b8? This occurs when the entropy is produced from the axion rotation immediately following the time when rotation comes to dominate.7 This minimizes the amount of time where H is not determined by n\u03b8. For this case,\n\u03b8\u0307 H ' \u03b8\u0307 \u03b8\u0307Sdom/MPl = MPl Sdom , \u03b4H H ' \u03b4n\u03b8 n\u03b8 = 3\u03b6, \u03b4\u03b8 ' MPl Sdom 3\u03b6 \u223c MPl Sdom \u00d7 10\u22124, (4.7)\nwhere Sdom is the field value of S when the rotation energy density dominates. One might think that this fluctuation could be reduced by choosing a very large Sdom. However, the circular axion rotation can dominate the universe only after the radial mode is thermalized, and for large values of S, the interaction of P with the thermal bath is suppressed and thermalization does not occur.\nLet us then estimate the maximal value of Sdom. It is maximized when the initial rotation has an O(1) ellipticity, dominates the universe, and is thermalized with the largest possible 7 In realistic situations, the entropy production can begin only much later, since the washout of the rotation\nrequires multiple explicit symmetry breaking, including the strong sphaleron process, as is discussed\nin Sec. 2.4. Entropy production immediately following domination could occur in principle if the PQ\nsymmetry is explicitly broken by interactions other than QCD but in a way that the extra explicit\nbreaking is negligible in the present universe so as not to spoil the solution to the strong CP problem.\nthermalization rate. For this case, the domination occurs immediately following thermalization, upon which the bath inherits its energy density from the radial mode. The assumption of O(1) ellipticity ensures that the angular mode has a comparable density. For thermalization via a Yukawa coupling y of P with a fermion, the thermalization rate is \u0393th ' 0.1y2T . Since yS < T is required for the fermion to be in the thermal bath, \u0393th < 0.1T 3/S2. With this bound on the rate, using \u0393th = 3H and \u03c0 2g\u2217T 4/30 = m2SS 2, we obtain\nSdom < 3\u00d7 1012 GeV\u00d7 ( mS\n106 GeV\n)1/3 . (4.8)\nCombining this result with Eq. (4.7) means \u03b4\u03b8 1 unless mS & 5\u00d71011 GeV. Even with the extremely optimistic assumptions we have made, mS > fa would be required to avoid \u03b4\u03b8 & 1, and the PQ symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken by the potentials in Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2). Therefore, large \u03b4\u03b8 is unavoidable unless there exists a more efficient thermalization mechanism.\nThe large \u03b4\u03b8 1 leads to the production of domain walls around the epoch of the QCD phase transition. Unlike the case with spontaneous PQ symmetry breaking after inflation, there are no PQ strings in the universe. Therefore, these domain walls cannot have boundaries made of strings, and hence cannot disappear by shrinking even if the domain wall number is unity. Note that \u03b4\u03b8 originates from the fluctuation of the PQ charge, so exists in long-wavelength modes. Therefore, the size of the domain walls ranges from the horizon size to the super-horizon size. Although domain walls annihilate as they enter the horizon, large domain walls continue to enter the horizon, and the universe is eventually dominated by domain walls.\nIn addition to the domain wall problem, which results when \u03b4\u03b8 & 1, fluctuations in \u03b8 can lead to fluctuations in the dark matter abundance produced by the misalignment and kinetic misalignment mechanisms. This will produce correlated dark matter isocurvature perturbations. This gives an even stronger constraint on \u03b4\u03b8. The constraint can be analytically derived if the rotation stops before the axion can begin oscillation, ma ' 3H. In this case, the axion abundance is simply determined by the misalignment contribution \u2126mish 2 [30\u201332] with the misalignment angle \u03b8mis and the fluctuation \u03b4\u03b8 around it. Since \u2126mish 2 \u221d \u03b82mis, the dark matter isocurvature perturbation is\nPSDM = 4(\u03b4\u03b8)2\n\u03b82mis\n( \u2126mish 2\n\u2126DMh2\n)2 ' 10\u22126(\u03b4\u03b8)2\u03b82mis ( fa\n109 GeV\n)2.38 . (4.9)\nThe constraint from the CMB measurements PSDM/P\u03b6 < 10\u22123 [85] gives\n\u03b4\u03b8 < 0.02 1\n\u03b8mis\n( 108 GeV\nfa\n)1.19 . (4.10)\nEven for the smallest possible fa \u223c 108 GeV, for the natural value \u03b8mis = O(1), Sdom & 1016 GeV is required; see Eq. (4.7). The thermalization must somehow occur right after the initiation of the rotation. Even the tuned case \u03b8mis \u223c \u03b4\u03b8 requires Sdom & 1015 GeV. If the rotation continues after the axion would begin oscillation, the axion dark matter is dominantly given by the kinetic misalignment mechanism. In this case, the axion dark matter abundance may non-trivially depend on \u03b4\u03b8. We do not discuss this case in this paper, but we expect a strong constraint from isocurvature perturbations.\nThese problems can be avoided by the restoration of the PQ symmetry. Here we discuss three ways in which the restoration of the PQ symmetry may occur\u2014via thermal trapping, parametric resonance, or Q-ball formation\u2014and how the domain wall and isocurvature problems from \u03b4\u03b8 are solved. The thermal trapping can occur after washout, so the curvaton has already imprinted adiabatic perturbations on the bath, and the trapping has no effect on their spectrum. Parametric resonance and Q-ball formation occur before adiabatic perturbations are produced, but as discussed in Sec. 2.3, they also do not affect the generation of adiabatic perturbations.\nSymmetry restoration via a thermal potential may occur for the one-field model of Eq. (4.1). Let us derive the condition for this PQ restoration to occur. If the rotation is completely washed out when the field value of the radial direction is Swo > fa, the temperature of the universe at that time is given by m2SS 2 wo = \u03c0 2g\u2217T 4 wo/30. A Yukawa coupling y of P with fermions gives a thermal mass \u223c yTwo as long as fermions are in the bath (yfa < Two). If this thermal mass exceeds the vacuum value, yTwo > mS, P will be trapped at the origin and \u03b4\u03b8 disappears. This removes both the domain wall and isocurvature problems. yTwo > mS and yfa < Two may be simultaneously satisfied if Swo & 10fa. Even if yfa > Two, the two-loop thermal log correction [102] gives a thermal mass \u223c \u03b13T 2/fa. This is larger than mS and the trapping at the origin occurs if Swo & 100fa. As discussed in Sec. 2.4, the washout rate is suppressed by the minimum of several rates (see Ref. [42] for details), so it is not always straightforward to have washout occur early enough. For gravity mediation with mS \u223c m\u03bb, we find that because of the suppression by the R symmetry breaking by the gluino mass, Swo > 10fa is possible only for fa close to the astrophysical\nlower bound of 108 GeV. Swo > 100fa requires additional R symmetry breaking beyond the MSSM. These strong requirements may be avoided if mS m\u03bb as in gauge mediation, but that requires more analysis (e.g., how the PQ symmetry is spontaneously broken in gauge mediation [103\u2013105]), and is beyond the scope of the present paper.\nThe parametric resonance discussed in Sec. 2.3 may also restore the PQ symmetry and solve the domain-wall and isocurvature problems. Even if the PQ symmetry is restored after parametric resonance in the sense that the spatial average of P is zero, P is not fixed to the origin (unlike the thermal trapping case), and \u03b4\u03b8 remains, and one might worry that the domain wall problem persists. However, cosmic strings can form [106\u2013112]. As we demonstrate in Appendix C, solutions for cosmic strings with non-zero n\u03b8 exist if the potential is steeper than the quadratic one. This is indeed the case for the vacuum potential of the PQ field. Thus, we expect that cosmic strings form as long as the PQ field potential is dominated by the vacuum one when parametric resonance occurs and the PQ symmetry is restored. Consequently, domain walls will have boundaries made of cosmic strings and so can decay as long as the domain wall number is unity. Another way to see the absence of the domain wall problem in the presence of the strings is that at the singularities at the string cores (P = 0), \u03b4\u03b8 is no longer well-defined. The long-wavelength isocurvature perturbations of the misalignment axion dark matter are also absent, because the misalignment abundance is determined by the randomized \u03b8 that results following the symmetry restoration, and is no longer sensitive to the \u03b4\u03b8 created by the rotation. For the one-field model in Eq. (4.1), we expect that the symmetry is indeed restored by parametric resonance, and therefore the model is free of the domain wall and isocurvature problems. For the two-field model in Eq. (4.2), the PQ symmetry is not restored as the two fields are strongly fixed at PP\u0304 = v2P where the PQ symmetry is broken. The domain walls do not obtain boundaries, and the domain wall problem persists.\nFinally, it may be possible to restore the PQ symmetry by Q-ball formation. As we discussed in Sec. 2.3, Q-balls can form when the potential of the PQ field is flatter than the quadratic one. This is indeed the case when the potential is dominated by the thermal contribution. For such a potential, fluctuations around the rotation have tachyonic instability modes and grow, and Q-balls eventually form. It may be that these large fluctuations lead to the restoration of the PQ symmetry as in parametric resonance; whether or not this actually occurs needs to be checked by a lattice computation. Also, after Q-ball formation,\nalmost all of the charge is stored in the Q-balls, and field values of S are small outside the Q-balls. Then thermal trapping can occur and the PQ symmetry can be restored. The PQ symmetry restoration, either by large fluctuations or thermal trapping, can solve the domain wall and isocurvature problems."

            "text": "In this paper, we discussed the generation of the curvature perturbations of the universe from the rotation of a complex field charged under an approximate U(1) symmetry. The scenario predicts an observable amount of local non-Gaussianity.\nThe rotation can be initiated by the Affleck-Dine mechanism. The angular direction of the complex field remains light during inflation and obtains fluctuations, which leads to the fluctuations of the U(1) charge of the rotation. The rotation is thermalized by its interaction with the thermal bath, and the radial mode is dissipated. On the other hand, the angular mode is thermodynamically stable against dissipation into the thermal bath and can be longlived, dominating the universe. Explicit U(1) symmetry breaking can eventually wash out the U(1) charge, and the angular mode can be dissipated to create entropy. The fluctuation of the charge then creates the curvature perturbations.\nThe rotation can also generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe. The baryon asymmetry, however, cannot directly come from the U(1) charge of the rotation as in Affleck-Dine baryogenesis, since the rotation is washed out to generate the entropy of the universe. For the axion, the washout can be partial, but the axion rotation does not carry baryon number. Indirect production is possible both for generic flat directions and the axion; the U(1) charge in the rotation may be transferred into asymmetries in the thermal bath prior to washout, and these asymmetries can be processed into B\u2212L asymmetry via B\u2212L breaking interactions, and the B\u2212L asymmetry is not washed out later. This possibility is discussed in Refs. [33, 34], where it is argued that an interaction that simultaneously breaks U(1) and B \u2212 L is required. However, as is discussed in [35, 36] in the context of axion rotations, such a special interaction is actually unnecessary, and B \u2212 L production occurs for generic B\u2212L breaking interactions, such as dimension-5 Majorana neutrino mass terms [35, 36] and R-parity violation [42]. As long as B \u2212 L production dominantly occurs after the entropy production from the washout of the rotation begins, the fluctuation of nB/s is absent, so\nno isocurvature perturbations are produced. This is in contrast with the case where the angular mode is assumed to have the same lifetime as the radial mode (which is unlikely as we argued), for which nB/s will fluctuate.\nFor the axion rotation, it is also possible to produce the baryon asymmetry by the weak anomaly [17], since the washout of the rotation can be only partial, and the rotation can continue even around the electroweak phase transition. Although only B + L is produced by the weak sphaleron transition [113, 114] and baryon asymmetry produced at high temperatures is washed out, a baryon asymmetry proportional to the axion velocity around the electroweak phase transition remains. For the QCD axion with the standard electroweak phase transition temperature \u223c 100 GeV, the required axion velocity is so large that the kinetic misalignment mechanism overproduces axion dark matter. Successful baryongenesis is possible for a larger electroweak phase transition temperature [17] or axion-like particles [38]. Such a baryon asymmetry would be produced much after the entropy production, and the isocurvature perturbation is absent.\nThe rotation can also produce dark matter via the kinetic misalignment mechanism [43], where the kinetic energy of the axion rotation is transferred into the axion dark matter density. The production occurs around temperatures of a GeV, long after entropy is produced, so no isocurvature perturbations are produced at the long-wavelength scales that are relevant for the CMB. The axion case without complete washout, however, requires parametric resonance at the early stage of the rotation as is discussed in Sec. 4.3. The parametric resonance also produces axion dark matter whose abundance is comparable to or larger than that from the kinetic misalignment mechanism [36, 44, 115]. Since this occurs before the entropy production, dark matter isocurvature is produced. In order for the kinetic misalignment mechanism to produce dominant component of dark matter without too large isocurvature perturbations, axions from the parametric resonance must be dissipated, e.g., by thermalization.\nDark matter and baryon asymmetry do not have to come from the rotation. As long as they are produced after the entropy is produced by the (partial) washout of the rotation, matter isocurvature perturbations are not produced. Viable examples include the freeze-out production of the LSP dark matter around the TeV scale and electroweak baryogenesis.\nAs we have demonstrated in this paper, rotations of complex fields can produce the curvature perturbations of the universe. The thermodynamic stability, which allows the\nrotation to persist, was a crucial ingredient for the success of the scenario. The persistence of the rotation also opens the possibility that the rotation can have impacts throughout the history of the Universe. As discussed above, because the axion rotation can survive to temperatures of 100-1000 GeV, it can produce the baryon asymmetry via axiogenesis with weak sphaleron processes. It can even survive to temperatures of a GeV, in which case it is relevant for the production of axion dark matter via kinetic misalignment. It will be interesting to investigate further possible cosmological roles of rotating fields.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe work was supported by the DoE office of science under grant DE-SC0011842 at the\nUniversity of Minnesota (R.C.) and DE-SC0007859 (A.P.) at the University of Michigan.\nAppendix A: Thermalization of MSSM flat directions\nIn this appendix, we discuss the thermalization of the rotation for some examples of\nMSSM flat directions.\nFirst, let us consider a u\u0304iu\u0304j d\u0304ke\u0304` flat direction that receives a large field value during inflation. The subscripts are generation indices with i 6= j. The large S field value breaks SU(3)c \u00d7 U(1)Y , but SU(2)L remains unbroken, so SU(2)L charged particles and gauge bosons interact efficiently and form a thermal bath after inflation. This flat direction has Yukawa couplings to Q, L, Hu, and Hd. If a Yukawa coupling y is large and yS > T , the particles that couple to S via the Yukawa coupling have exponentially small thermal abundance, but S has one-loop suppressed coupling to the SU(2)L gauge boson. If a Yukawa coupling is small and yS < T , S may be thermalized via the Yukawa interaction.\n1. Thermalization via SU(2)L gauge bosons\nWe first discuss the thermalization by the SU(2)L gauge boson, whose rate is [116, 117]\n\u0393th,W ' 10\u22125 T 3\nS2 . (A.1)\nAssuming a large enough initial value of Si, the thermalization occurs after the flat direction dominates the energy density of the universe. Then just after the thermalization, m2SS 2 '\n\u03c02g\u2217T 4 th/30 and \u0393th,W ' 3H ' 3(\u03c02g\u2217T 4th/90)1/2/MPl, so\nTth ' 7\u00d7 106 GeV ( mS\n100 TeV\n)2 3 ( 150\ng\u2217(Tth)\n)1 2 , (A.2)\nSth ' 4\u00d7 109 GeV ( mS\n100 TeV\n)1 3 ( 150\ng\u2217(Tth)\n)1 2 . (A.3)\nNote that Sth Tth, so the U(1) charge can indeed remain mostly in the circular rotation after thermalization. Henceforth, we use the number of degrees of freedom g\u2217 = 150 as a reference point, as the flat direction gives large masses to SU(3)c\u00d7U(1)Y gauge multiplets.\nIf the ellipticity of the initial rotation is O(1), which is the case in gravity mediation, the circular rotation remaining after thermalization has a comparable energy density to radiation, so the domination by the circular rotation follows immediately after the completion of thermalization. If the washout rate of the rotation is smaller than the thermalization rate in Eq. (A.1), washout occurs long after the domination by the circular rotation, and our computation of the curvature perturbation is applicable. This is expected to hold because effective washout requires multiple symmetry breakings, as discussed in Sec. 2.4.\nThere are several consistency conditions for our analysis on the thermalization by the SU(2)L gauge boson to be applicable. First, we assumed ySth > Tth. This is satisfied when\nmS . 10 7 GeV ( y 0.01 )3 . (A.4)\nSince at least one of u\u0304iu\u0304j must be a charm or top, this condition is always satisfied for mS < 10 7 GeV. Second, we assumed that the rotation is initiated by the zero-temperature potential. However, the coupling of the flat direction with the weak gauge boson generates a two-loop suppressed thermal-log potential [102]\nVth ' \u03b122T 4 ln ( y2S2\nT 2\n) , (A.5)\nand we will use \u03b12 = 1/20 in what follows. To ensure that rotation is initiated by the zero-temperature potential rather than the thermal one requires\nSi &  1016 GeV ( 150 g\u2217 )1 2\n: TR & 1011 GeV ( mS 100 TeV )1 2 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 4\n1015 GeV (\nTR 1010 GeV ) ( 100 TeV mS )1 2 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 4 : TR . 1011 GeV ( mS 100 TeV )1 2 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 4 , (A.6)\nwhere Si is the field value of S when 3H ' mS and TR is the reheat temperature after inflation. The first line corresponds to the initiation of the rotation during radiation domination,\nwhile the second line is during matter domination by the inflaton. This condition restricts M and/or n to be sufficiently large; see Eq. (2.5). For example, for mS = 10 5 GeV, n = 7 and M = MPl fulfills this condition. If this condition is violated, the kick in the angular direction becomes relatively weak. Then, the circular rotation comes to dominate only long after the completion of the thermalization, and there is a danger that washout will happen first. In this case, the rotation cannot be the curvaton. Finally, we have assumed the initial rotation dominates the universe before thermalization. This occurs if\nSi & 10 16 GeV ( mS 100 TeV ) 1 12 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 8\n: TR & 1011 GeV ( mS 100 TeV )1 2 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 4\n4\u00d7 1016 GeV (\nmS 100 TeV\n)1 3 ( 1010 GeV\nTR\n)1 2 (\n150 g\u2217\n)1 4 : TR . 1011 GeV ( mS 100 TeV )1 2 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 4 .\n(A.7)\nFor a low reheat temperature, it is possible that Eq. (A.6) is satisfied while Eq. (A.7) is not. In this case, while the rotation is initiated by the vacuum potential and so the kick to the angular direction is unsuppressed, thermalization occurs during radiation domination. This means the remaining circular rotation can dominate the universe at a temperature TRM only long after the completion of the thermalization, and again there is the danger that washout will occur prior to TRM. The charge yield of the rotation is given by the second case of Eq. (2.9) with a U(1) = O(m3/2/mS) and TRM is given by Eq. (2.12). For Y\u03b8 < 0.1, however, Eq. (2.12) gives SRM < TRM. This means matter domination by the rotation actually does not occur, since the rotation is no longer stable for S < T ; almost all of the charge in the rotation is transferred into the particle-antiparticle asymmetry in the bath, and the rotation dissipates before it has a chance to dominate the energy density.8 In this case, the rotation cannot act as a successful curvaton, since the non-Gaussianity of the curvature perturbations becomes too large.\n2. Thermalization via Yukawa couplings\nWe next consider the thermalization by a Yukawa coupling, whose rate is [117]\n\u0393th,y ' \u03b12y2T, (A.8)\n8 This is true for MSSM flat directions. However, for generic scalar fields, it is a logical possibility that\nafter the rotation thermalizes, it decouples from the thermal bath again. In this case, the rotation can\nbe stable even if S < T so can come to dominate the universe. Once the rotation recouples to the bath\nafterward, the entropy of the universe can be dominantly created from the rotation.\nand we use \u03b12 = 1/30 in the following. Assuming the thermalization after the flat direction dominates the energy density of the universe,\nTth ' 6\u00d7 106 GeV (\ny\n3\u00d7 10\u22125\n)2( 150\ng\u2217(Tth)\n)1 2 , (A.9)\nSth ' 2\u00d7 109 GeV (\ny\n3\u00d7 10\u22125\n)4( 100 TeV\nmS\n)( 150\ng\u2217(Tth)\n)1 2 .

(A.11)\nThis condition must be satisfied for max(yui , yuj) or max(ydk , ye`), since they give masses to Hu and Hd, respectively. max(yui , yuj) \u2265 yc violates this condition for realistic mS, and the thermalization by the up-type Yukawa coupling cannot occur.\nThe thermalization by y is more effective than that by the one-loop suppressed coupling\nwith the SU(2)L gauge boson if\ny & 3\u00d7 10\u22125 ( mS\n100 TeV\n)1 3 . (A.12)\nFor mS = 100\u20131000 TeV, the observed Higgs mass requires that tan\u03b2 <\u223c 3, so the conditions in Eqs. (A.11) and (A.12) can be satisfied only by yd. For 1 TeV < mS . 100 TeV, tan\u03b2 can be larger and these two conditions can be satisfied by yd and ye.\nThe Yukawa coupling can also impact the initiation of the rotation, by giving a one-loop thermal mass \u223c yT when the rotation is initiated. The thermal potential is ineffective if one of the following two conditions are met for both max(yui , yuj) and max(ydk , ye`).\nSi & 10 16 GeV ( 10\u22125 y ) ( mS 100 TeV )1 2 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 4\n: TR & 1011 GeV ( mS 100 TeV )1 2 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 4\n4\u00d7 1015 GeV ( 10\u22125\ny\n) ( mS\n100 TeV\n)1 4 (\nTR 1010 GeV\n)1 2 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 8 : TR . 1011 GeV ( mS 100 TeV )1 2 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 4\nmS & 2\u00d7 10 7 GeV ( y 10\u22125 )2 (150 g\u2217 )1 2\n: TR & 2\u00d7 1012 GeV ( y 10\u22125 ) ( 150 g\u2217 )1 2\n600 TeV (\ny 10\u22125\n)4 3 (\nTR 1010 GeV\n)2 3 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 6 : TR . 2\u00d7 1012 GeV ( y 10\u22125 ) ( 150 g\u2217 )1 2 . (A.13)\nThe condition on Si comes from the case where the particles have masses above T , ySi > Trot, so the thermal potential is exponentially suppressed. Here Trot is the temperature at which\nthe rotation is initiated by the vacuum potential, i.e., mS = 3H(Trot). The condition onmS is when the thermal mass is present but negligible compared to the vacuum mass, yTrot < mS.\nThe condition for the flat direction to dominate the energy of the universe before the\ncompletion of the thermalization is given by\nSi & 9\u00d7 10 15 GeV ( y 3\u00d710\u22125 ) ( 100 TeV mS )1 4 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 8\n: TR & 1011 GeV ( mS 100 TeV )1 2 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 4\n3\u00d7 1016 GeV (\ny 3\u00d710\u22125\n) ( 1010 GeV\nTR\n)1 2 (\n150 g\u2217\n)1 4 : TR . 1011 GeV ( mS 100 TeV )1 2 ( 150 g\u2217 )1 4\n(A.14)\nIf this condition is violated, the charge yield is given by Eq. (2.9) and the circular rotation dominates the universe at the temperature given by Eq. (2.12).\nBased on the above computation, one can see that the circular rotation can indeed dominate the universe for sufficiently large Si and/or TR. A similar analysis is applicable to QQQL, Qu\u0304Le\u0304, and Qu\u0304Qd\u0304 flat directions, which keep a U(1), SU(2), and U(1) gauge symmetry unbroken, respectively. The SU(2)L gauge symmetry in the above analysis should be replaced by the unbroken gauge symmetry. All of these directions have B \u2212 L = 0, so can be washed out by the interactions and masses in the MSSM.\n3. Q-balls\nIn the above discussion, we neglected the possible production of Q-balls. Since the thermal potential is flatter than the quadratic one, when it dominates over the vacuum potential, Q-balls can form [118, 119]. However, we argue that those Q-balls disappear before the circular rotation dominates the universe. The condition for a Q-ball solution to exist is that V (S, T )/S2 has a global minimum at S0 6= 0 [60]. It is also required that the distance between Q-balls should be larger then the radii of Q-balls [120]; otherwise Q-balls coalesce and then the field configuration reverts to a nearly homogeneous rotation. This condition is equivalent to requiring that the charge density inside Q-balls \u223c mSS20 be larger than the average charge density of the universe n\u03b8. In our setup, the latter is violated first; in order to serve as a curvaton, the rotation must dominate the universe, so n\u03b8 is quite large.\nFirst we consider the case with yS > T . Then the combination of the thermal log potential in Eq. (A.5) and the zero temperature potential (with correction Km2S|P |2ln|P |2) gives a global minimum for V (S, T )/S2 at an S0 given by Km 2 SS 2 0 \u223c \u03b122T 4. The Q-balls\ndisappear when\nmSS 2 0\nn\u03b8 \u223c \u03b1\n2 2T 4\nKmSn\u03b8 \u223c 10\n\u22125\nK\nT\nTRM < 1. (A.15)\nIn the second equality, we have replaced n\u03b8 in favor of the temperature TRM where the rotation dominates using Eq. (2.12). As we discussed in Sec. 2.3, the two-loop corrections from the gauge interactions and scalar masses generate K \u223c 10\u22123, so the Q-balls disappear well before the circular rotation dominates at TRM.\nWe next consider the case with yS < T . The one-loop thermal potential induced by the\nYukawa coupling is, in the high temperature expansion,\nV (S, T ) ' 1 24 y2S2T 2 \u2212 1 12\u03c0 y3S3T + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A.16)\nThen, the location of the minimum S0 is found where y 3TS0/(12\u03c0) \u223c Km2S. Then Q-balls disappear when\nmSS 2 0\nn\u03b8 \u223c (12\u03c0K) 2m5S y6T 2n\u03b8 < T 4 12\u03c0KmSn\u03b8 \u223c 10\n\u22123\nK\nT\nTRM < 1 (A.17)\nwhere we imposed yS0 < T in the first inequality, so that the one-loop thermal potential is not exponentially suppressed. Even for this optimal Yukawa coupling, the Q-balls disappear before the circular rotation dominates.\nAppendix B: Numerical computation of the charge fluctuation\nIn this Appendix, we compute the dependence of the charge density on the initial angle\n\u03b8i. The equation of motion of the field P is\nd2P\ndt2 + 3H\ndP dt + \u2202V \u2202P \u2217 = 0. (B.1)\nWe make the time and field value dimensionless by the following change of variables,\nt = 1\nmS z, P =\n[ mSM n\u22122\nn1/2(n+ 1)\n] 1 n\u22121\np. (B.2)\nUsing the potential in Eq. (2.3), the resulting equation of motion is given by\np\u0308+ 2\n(1 + w)z p\u0307+ p|p|2n\u22122 + a U(1) n\u2212 2 n1/2 p\u2217n + p\u2212 cH 4 9(1 + w)2z2 p = 0, (B.3)\nwhere the dots represent derivatives with respect to z. Here, \u03c9 = 1/3 and 0 for radiation domination and matter domination, respectively. When z 1, the fourth and fifth terms are negligible and p follows an attractor solution if n > 3 for matter domination and n > 5 for radiation domination [11, 57]:\n|p(z)| = ((\n4cH 9(1 + w)2 + 2 (n\u2212 1)(1 + w) \u2212 n (n\u2212 1)2\n) 1\nz2\n) 1 2n\u22122\n. (B.4)\nOne can show that Eq. (B.4) is indeed an attractor by the change of variables p = z\u22121/(n\u22121)\u00d7 \u03c8 and z \u221d exp(3(1 + w)N/2). Then the potential terms for \u03c8 as well as its minimum are N -independent, and the sign of the friction term of the equation of motion of \u03c8 is positive if n > 1 + 2(1 + w)/(1\u2212 w).\nWe numerically solve Eq. (B.3) starting from z = z0 1 with an initial condition\nfollowing the attractor solution,\np(z0) =\n(( 4cH\n9(1 + w)2 +\n2 (n\u2212 1)(1 + w) \u2212 n (n\u2212 1)2\n) 1\nz20\n) 1 2n\u22122\n\u00d7 exp(i\u03b8i), 0 \u2264 \u03b8i \u2264 2\u03c0\nn+ 1 ,\np\u2032(z0) =\u2212 1\n(n\u2212 1)z0 \u00d7 p(z0), (B.5)\nand compute the charge density \u221d i(p\u2217p\u2032 \u2212 pp\u2217\u2032) as a function of \u03b8i at a fixed time zi 1 such that the explicit PQ breaking is negligible. This is the case for zi & 10. As long as\nthe universe is dominated by the inflaton or the radiation created from it at z = zi, we may identify zi as a flat time slice.\nIn Fig. 3, we show the charge density in an arbitrary unit for n = 7 for several values\nof a U(1) . Here we assume radiation domination. For small a U(1) , the sign of the charge is simply determined by the sign of the potential gradient in the angular direction at \u03b8i and is negative for 0 < (n + 1)\u03b8i < \u03c0 and positive for \u03c0 < (n + 1)\u03b8i < 2\u03c0. For a U(1) = O(1), the angular direction oscillates before the explicit breaking becomes ineffective, and the charge non-trivially depends on \u03b8i.\nAppendix C: Rotating string\nIn this Appendix, we demonstrate the existence of cosmic strings that rotate in field space. The rotating string is analogous to vortices that appear in Bose-Einstein condensation in condensed matter systems. The existence of these strings is important for the successful collapse of the domain walls following PQ restoration via parametric resonance, as discussed in Sec. 4.3. We consider a rotating configuration with cylindrical symmetry:\nP = 1\u221a 2 S(r)ei\u03c9t+im\u03c6, (C.1)\nwith m an integer, (r, \u03c6) the cylindrical coordinate variables, S(0) = 0, and S(\u221e) = S\u221e. The equation of motion gives\nd2S dr2 + 1 r dS dr \u2212 m 2 r2 S + \u03c92S \u2212 V \u2032(S) = 0. (C.2)\nAt r =\u221e, the last two terms dominate, so we obtain a relation between \u03c9 and S\u221e,\n\u03c92 = V \u2032(S\u221e)\nS\u221e . (C.3)\nIn the cosmology we consider, we may estimate \u03c9 and S\u221e from this relation for fixed charge density n\u03b8 = \u03c9S 2 \u221e.\nWe may demonstrate the existence of cosmic string solutions by employing the technique used to show a bounce solution in tunneling problems [121] and a Q-ball solution [60], wherein we regard S as a trajectory with r as a time variable. The equation of motion of S is that of a particle moving in 1D with a 1/r friction term and a \u201ctime\u201d-dependent potential\nVeff(S) = 1\n2\n( \u03c92 \u2212 m 2\nr2\n) S2 \u2212 V (S). (C.4)\nAround r \u223c 0, the first three terms in Eq. (C.2) dominate and S increases in proportion to r|m|,\nS(r)\u2192 br|m| (r \u2192 0), (C.5)\nwhere b is a constant determined by satisfying the condition S(\u221e) = S\u221e. At large r, the potential Veff becomes r-independent. If\nV \u2032\u2032eff(S\u221e) = \u03c9 2 \u2212 V \u2032\u2032(S\u221e) =\nV \u2032(S\u221e)\nS\u221e \u2212 V \u2032\u2032(S\u221e) < 0, (C.6)\nnamely, V (S) is steeper than a quadratic potential at S\u221e, then Veff has a maximum at S\u221e for r \u2192 \u221e. If b is too small, S does not reach S\u221e and goes back to 0. If b is too large, S goes over the maximum and runs away to infinity. Therefore, there is a value of b such that S lands onto S\u221e at r = \u221e. This solution corresponds to a cosmic string. The core size is determined by the curvature of Veff ,\nr\u22121c \u2261 \u221a \u2212V \u2032\u2032eff(S\u221e) = \u221a V \u2032\u2032(S\u221e)\u2212 V \u2032(S\u221e)\nS\u221e . (C.7)\nThe condition for the string solution to exist, namely, a potential V (S) steeper than a quadratic one, is complementary to the condition for the Q-ball solution to exist, a potential\nflatter than a quadratic one [60]. Note also unlike the usual case without rotations, the cosmic string solutions do not require V (S) itself to have a minimum at non-zero S; this is because of the centrifugal potential. This allows rotating strings even for the MSSM flat directions. Like non-rotating global strings, the tension of the rotating string is IR-divergent, which is cut off by the distance between strings.\nAs an example, let us consider the following potential, typical of MSSM flat directions,\nV (S) = 1\n2 m2SS 2\n( 1 +K ln ( S2 +m2S m2S )) . (C.8)\nThe logarithmic term arises as a result of quantum correction that has an IR cutoff at the soft mass scale mS. If K > 0, the potential is steeper than a quadratic one, and we expect that a rotating cosmic string solution exists. It is convenient to normalize S by S\u221e and r by rc, i.e., \u03c3 = S/S\u221e and \u03c1 = r/rc. In these variables, the equation of motion is\nd2\u03c3 d\u03c12 + 1 \u03c1 d\u03c3 d\u03c1 \u2212 m 2 \u03c12 \u03c3 +\n(\u22062 + 1) 2 (\n1 \u22062\u03c32+1 \u2212 1 \u22062+1\n\u2212 ln (\n\u22062\u03c32+1 \u22062+1 )) 2\u22062 (\u22062 + 2) \u03c3 = 0, (C.9)\nwhere \u2206 = S\u221e/mS. Here \u03c9 is chosen according to Eq. (C.3). Note that the K-dependence disappears from the equation of motion. In Fig. 4, we show normalized profiles of the string solutions, where the various curves correspond to different choices of m. Here we take \u2206 = 50, but the normalized profile is nearly independent of S\u221e/mS as long as S\u221e mS. This is because in the limit S\u221e mS, the last term in Eq. (C.9) simplifies to \u2212\u03c3 ln\u03c3, which is independent of \u2206. In this limit, rc ' 1/( \u221a 2KmS).\n[1] K. Enqvist and M. S.
