 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the binding kinetics of E-4031 and E-4031-17 using more detailed protocols to understand differences in drug trapping and dissociation. This could provide insights into the role of the methanesulphonate group in binding kinetics.

2. Evaluate additional E-4031 analogues lacking other polar substituents to further probe structure-activity relationships. This could identify other chemical groups not critical for high affinity binding. 

3. Conduct mutagenesis studies pairing inactivation-attenuating mutations like N588K with pore helix mutations like S624A to better understand their interplay in enabling high affinity binding.

4. Solve a high-resolution hERG channel structure with E-4031-17 bound to definitively identify binding poses and interactions. This could clarify roles of key residues like F656.

5. Evaluate activity of E-4031-17 in an in vivo model (e.g. guinea pig cardiomyocytes) to determine if binding differences translate to functional differences in native cells. This could have implications for drug development.
