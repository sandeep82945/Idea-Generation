The carcinogenic properties of these compounds have been strongly supported by a number of epidemiological and animal studies (reviewed in International Agency for Research on Cancer 1 ). Furthermore, these studies implicated diverse Cr(VI) compounds of variable solubility, suggesting that their carcinogenicity is attributable to Cr(VI) generally rather than to only some specific Cr(VI) compounds.\nThe cellular and molecular changes underlying the biological effects of Cr(VI) exposure that may be responsible for cancer induction are incompletely understood.

In typical physiologically normal intracellular onditions (pH 7.0\u20137.4), the main form of Cr(VI) is chromate anion rO 2 \u22124 (Fig. 2 ). Consistent with this finding, CrO 2 \u2212 4 and HCrO \u2212 4 repesent 76% and 24% of Cr(VI) species, respectively, at pH 7.4 and otal Cr(VI) concentration 1 \u03bcM to 10 mM. 5 In contrast, at pH 2\u2013 , the prevalent species are HCrO \u22124 and dichromate Cr 2 O 2 \u2212 7 anions Fig. 2 ), and the main species at pH < 1 is H 2 Cr O 4 . 6 In the stomach uid with pH \u22482 and the total Cr(VI) of 10 \u03bcM, the distribution f Cr(VI) species was reportedly 94% HCrO \u22124 , 5% H 2 Cr O 4 , and 1% r 2 O 2 \u22127 . 5 The biological activity of Cr(VI) is contingent on the cellular upake of HCrO \u22124 and CrO 2 \u2212 4 , which occurs rapidly via sulfate and ossibly other anion transporters 8 found in the cell membrane f all mammalian cells. 9 This is made possible due to the strucural similarity between the tetrahedral chromate ( CrO 2 \u22124 ) or hyrochromate ( HCrO \u22124 ) anions and sulfate (SO 4 2 \u2212) anions. Another ritical feature of the biological activity of Cr(VI) is the redox eactivity between extracellular or intracellular reductants [e.g. lutathione (GSH), l -ascorbic acid, cysteine, hydrogen peroxide]\nig. 3 Latimer diagram for chromium species.

The Latimer diagram for Cr pecies implies that the most stable oxidation state for chromium s Cr(III), with positive potential on the left and negative potential n the right. Notably, some Cr species generated by the intracelular reduction of Cr(VI) can also undergo disproportionation rections and change their oxidation state without reactions with ther redox-active compounds. The species that can disproporionate are Cr(V) and Cr(IV) (Section Cr(V) and Cr(IV)), which have n the Latimer diagram higher potential to the right of the species han the potential on the left (Fig. 3 ). Chromium (VI) compounds are not considered reactive toward urified DNA in buffered solutions under physiological condiions. Consequently, their ability to induce DNA damage in exosed cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo was explained by the ptake-reduction model of Cr(VI)-mediated genotoxicity. 10 Based n this model, Cr(VI) species taken up by cells undergo intracelluar reduction, which is predominantly driven by l -ascorbate, gluathione, and cysteine, to form the DNA-reactive and/or oxidative amage-inducing intermediates Cr(V), Cr(IV) and eventually the hermodynamically stable Cr(III), which accumulates in cells via ts binding to DNA and other molecules. 11 , 12\nhromium VI lthough Cr(VI) itself is not DNA-reactive, results of cell-free studes in buffered solutions provide some support for the existence f interactions between DNA and Cr(VI) compounds. For instance, study that employed chromium trioxide (CrO 3 ) demonstrated n interaction between Cr(VI) and calf thymus DNA at high CrO 3 oncentrations (0.2\u20132 mmol/L) using several spectral analytical ethods. 13 Another study demonstrated the ability of CrO 3 at igh concentrations ( > 80 \u03bcM) to cause DNA damage and induce NA strand breaks, as well as linearization and degradation of upercoiled circular plasmid DNA; however, the results indicated onsiderably lower DNA-damaging potency of CrO 3 relative to rCl 3 . 14 Both these studies suggested intercalative interaction etween CrO 3 and DNA and implied that Cr(VI) and Cr(III) Section Cr(III)) differ in their modes of interaction with DNA. imilar results were also found for Cr(VI) in the form of the hromate anion ( CrO 2 \u22124 ), which showed a weak complexation ith DNA at high molar ratios (r) of CrO 2 \u22124 to nucleotides ( r > 1) ut not at low molar ratios ( r = 1:20 to r = 1:1). 15 However, the very igh concentrations of CrO 3 or CrO 2 \u2212 4 at which the interactions\nith DNA were observed in these studies are of unclear biological elevance to typical environmental exposures. In general, Cr(VI) species do not show interaction with DNA xcept for experiments in which DNA was exposed to high oncentrations of CrO 3 or chromates in vitro . One plausible xplanation is that this is due to the strong electrostatic repulions between negatively charged CrO 2 \u22124 anions and phosphate roups in the DNA backbone that suppresses interactions\nin acid conditions.

Interestingly, low micromolar concentrations of CrO 2 \u22124 were shown to block the intercalation of the anticancer drug mitoxantrone into a DNA double helix in calf-thymus DNA. 16 Nevertheless, this effect was not caused by competition between mitoxantrone and CrO 2 \u22124 in binding to DNA but rather via a Cr(VI)-mediated oxidative modification of guanine residues, which reportedly reduced the stacking interactions of intercalated mitoxantrone. 16\nIn contrast to Cr(VI), the intermediate species Cr(V) and Cr(IV) and the terminal Cr(III) species, generated during the intracellular reduction of Cr(VI), can induce DNA damage through their direct interactions with DNA, or indirectly via oxidative damage. 17 Reduction of Cr(VI) in cell-free or cell-based systems, or in vivo , generates variable amounts of the intermediate chromium species depending on the nature and concentration of the reducers, concentrations of Cr-species, and other conditions. 18 It has been suggested that the abundance of specific intermediate species could be a major factor determining the DNA-damaging activity of Cr(VI). 19\nIt should be noted that studies performed in some cell-free or cell-based systems, which do not fully reflect physiological conditions and concentrations of intracellular reducers, may not truly reflect cellular and molecular processes that occur in human tissues under environmental exposures to Cr(VI). This limitation affects mechanistic cell-free studies that used certain nonphysiological buffers and cell-based studies that employed ascorbate-depleted cells grown in standard cell culture media. 20 Because ascorbate represents a major intracellular reductant of Cr(VI), 21 restoration of ascorbate in cell-based systems is necessary for a correct assessment of the fate of Cr(VI) and DNA damage following its intracellular uptake.\nReduction of Cr(VI) is a kinetically controlled process, and the role of specific reductants reflects their reaction rates with Cr(VI) compounds and their intracellular concentrations. The highest rate of Cr(VI) reduction was found for ascorbate, followed by cysteine and glutathione, with respective rate ratios of 61:13:1. 22 Because typical intracellular concentrations of ascorbate (1\u20132 mM) and glutathione (1\u201310 mM) are comparable and considerably higher than that of cysteine (0.03\u20130.2 mM), 23 the principal intracellular reducer of Cr(VI) is ascorbate, accounting for 80\u201390% of its metabolism. 11 , 12 Ascorbate and glutathione also display a synergistic effect on the reduction of Cr(VI), as the rate of this reduction by a mixture of ascorbate and glutathione under physiologically relevant conditions was found to be higher than the sum of the reduction rates of each of these reductants. 24\nReduction of Cr(VI) by ascorbate generates variable amounts of Cr(V), Cr(IV), and carbon-based radicals. 25 At physiologically relevant molar ratios of ascorbate to Cr(VI) that exceed 2:1, the only detectable intermediate reduction product is reportedly Cr(IV). The presence of Cr(V) is detectable only at nonphysiological ratios of the equimolar or lower ratio of ascorbate to Cr(VI) or in ascorbate-depleted cells. 12 , 25 Reduction of Cr(VI) by ascorbate under physiologically relevant conditions is a low oxidantgenerating process that remarkably differs from the reduction of Cr(VI) by glutathione, which generates substantially more reactive oxygen species (ROS). 26 However, despite reduced oxidative damage in cells with restored ascorbate, these cells can still experience a large increase in genotoxicity, as shown in one study by an increased frequency of DNA double-strand break markers. 26 Another study found an increased formation of DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) and intracellular chromium accumulation in ascorbate pretreated Chinese hamster V-79 cells exposed to Cr(VI). 27 As a result, ascorbate under physiologically relevant con-\nditions appears to increase genotoxicity by a nonoxidative mechanism, which can presumably include the formation of Cr-DNA and ascorbate-Cr-DNA adducts.\nThe reduced form of glutathione is a major intracellular reducer of Cr(VI) in cells cultured without restoration of l -ascorbate. Reduction by GSH can be a one- or two-electron process, 12 but more typically, it proceeds as a one-electron process sequentially producing Cr(V), Cr(IV), and Cr(III) species. 28 Aiyar et al . detected two Cr(V)-glutathione complexes and glutathione thiyl radical produced by a reaction between Cr 2 O 2 \u22127 (1.35 mM) and glutathione (2.7 mM) in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). 29 However, a reaction of Cr(VI) with glutathione and hydrogen peroxide yielded different products depending on the sequence in which Cr(VI) reacted with each of these reductants. If Cr(VI) reacted with GSH first and then with hydrogen peroxide, a dramatic increase of hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) was observed, presumably due to a Fenton-like reaction between Cr(V)-complexes and hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4 a). 29 In contrast, however, the reaction of Cr(VI) with a pre-incubated mixture of glutathione and hydrogen peroxide produced substantially less \u2022OH radical, and no evidence was found for the production of glutathione thiyl radical and Cr(V)-glutathione complexes. 29 Similarly, the reaction of Cr(VI) with DNA in the presence of GSH alone led to a substantially higher Cr-DNA binding than this reaction in the presence of a GSH-hydrogen peroxide mixture. 30 These results suggest that Cr-DNA binding was mediated by Cr(V)-glutathione complexes. Likewise, pre-incubation of DNA with Cr(VI) and glutathione, followed by the addition of hydrogen peroxide, induced the formation of significantly more DNA strand breaks than the reaction of Cr(VI) with a mixture of GSH and hydrogen peroxide or the reaction of Cr(VI) with hydrogen peroxide alone. This result is consistent with the highest generation of \u2022OH radical when preformed Cr(V)-glutathione complexes react with hydrogen peroxide. A similar result was reported for a reaction between Cr(VI), riboflavin, and hydrogen peroxide, in which higher generation of hydroxyl radical and higher production of DNA single-strand breaks was attributed to the formation of Cr(V) intermediate that subsequently reacted with hydrogen peroxide. 31\nReduction by cysteine in the presence of variable amounts of glutathione is also a one- or two-electron process; however, the one-electron process dominates in the physiological range of concentrations. 32 The reaction of Cr(VI) with calf thymus DNA in the presence of cysteine resulted in the formation of the DNACr(cysteine) 2-4 cross-links. 33 Nevertheless, the maximal amount of bound chromium per nucleotide was found to be \u223c10-fold lower than that measured for the reaction of Cr(VI) with DNA in the presence of GSH. 33"

This \u201ctetraperoxochromate(V) theory\u201d of Cr(VI)ediated carcinogenesis was also challenged by Shi and Dalal, 34\nho argued that CrO 3 \u22128 is not significantly formed by the reuction of Cr(VI) with biologically relevant reductants and that rO 8 3- does not generate significant amounts of hydroxyl radical. nstead, these investigators showed that Cr(V) forms complexes ith biological reductants that subsequently react with hydroen peroxide and generate \u2022OH radicals via a Fenton-like reaction Fig. 4 a). 34\nBesides conflicting views on specific forms of Cr(V) for the genration of ROS, controversies also arose over the relative role of he ROS-mediated indirect DNA damage vs. Cr(V)-mediated direct xidation of DNA. For instance, Casadevall et al . disputed the imortance of the \u2022OH radicals in the DNA damage caused by the eduction of Cr(VI) with glutathione or l -ascorbic acid and emphaized direct oxidation of 2-deoxyribose without \u2022OH radicals from enton-like reaction. 39 This direct oxidation reportedly proceeds hrough Cr(V)-mediated abstraction of hydrogen atoms at the 2- eoxyribose moiety and leads to the generation of the singletrand breaks and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites (AP-sites). 39 , 40 Reorted generation of AP-sites in DNA exposed to Cr(VI) in the presnce of ascorbate or glutathione 41 , 42 provides support for this diect metal-mediated oxidation of deoxyribose sugar moiety. To elucidate the specific role of Cr(V) in the modification of NA separately from other species generated by the reduction of r(VI), Shi et al . 34 studied the reaction of DNA with a Cr(V) comlex bis(2-ethy-2-hydroxybutyrato) oxochromate(V) in a cell-free ystem. Treatment with this complex induced damage in short NA fragments of the TP53 gene, accompanied by the formation f adducts at the dG and dA positions and oxidative damage at he dG positions. These findings were interpreted as evidence for he ability of Cr(V) to interact with the N7 atom of purines and orm the Cr(V)-dG and Cr(V)-dA DNA adducts. Furthermore, oberved oxidative damage at the dG sites with the formation of the -OHdG residues was reportedly caused by hydroxyl radicals genrated through the Fenton-like reaction (Fig. 4 a). 34\nA similar approach to study the DNA reactivity of Cr(V) as taken by Bose et al ., 35 , 36 who used the anionic comlex of Cr(V) with multidentate ligand bis(hydroxyethyl)aminoris(hydroxymethyl)methane, which is stable at neutral pH. These nvestigators confirmed cleavage of ssDNA proceeding through he oxidation of 2-deoxyribose to furfural and 5-methylene-2uranone (5-MF) and the release of all four DNA bases. Of note, the eaction of this Cr(V) complex with dsDNA induced only singletrand breaks and no double-strand breaks, possibly due to steric imitations in the Cr(V)-dsDNA complexes and rapid disproporionation of Cr(V) (Fig. 4 f). 35\nThis process was reportedly initiated by coordination between r(V) and the phosphodiester backbone of the DNA and was likely ollowed by hydrogen abstraction from the C1 \u2032 and C5 \u2032 positions\nf the 2-deoxyribose. 35 , 36 In contrast to others, these investigators riginally did not observe 8-OHdG, possibly due to the use of Bisris buffer that scavenges hydroxyl radicals needed for oxidation f guanine; nevertheless, the possibility of direct Cr(V)-mediated xidation of guanine residues has not been ruled out. In a subseuent study reported by Bose et al ., 36 the formation of 2-deoxy-8ydroxyguanosine was observed, but the authors concluded that OH radicals did not participate in the oxidation of dG residues, nd the formation of 8-OHdG was attributed to the direct oxidaion of dG by Cr(V). 36 Importantly, Cr(V) was shown to oxidize the -OHdG residues further and generate spiroiminohydantoin sites, hich can arrest DNA polymerase and induce a high degree of isincorporation of dA opposite to these sites during the replicaion of DNA, resulting in G \u2192 T transversions. 43 Intriguingly, the formation of the Cr(V) intermediate has een demonstrated not only in vitro by electron paramagnetic esonance spectroscopy (EPR) spectroscopy in Cr(VI)-treated cells ultured in traditional media without ascorbate restoration, 44 ut also in vivo , in the liver and kidney of mice exposed to Cr(VI) y intravenous administration. 44 In this animal study, the EPR ignal intensity corresponding to Cr(V) was decreased in animals retreated with metal ion chelators, ascorbate, or glutathione but ncreased following pretreatment with NADH. 44\nCr(IV) has been speculated to be the ultimate carcinogen in r(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. 36 This species is the major tranient form of intracellular reduction of Cr(VI) in cells with physological levels of ascorbate. In the presence of hydrogen peroxde, Cr(IV) generates hydroxyl radicals, and acts as a more potent enton-like reagent than Cr(V) (Fig. 4 b). This reaction has been hown to cause DNA strand breaks 45 and oxidative damage at he dG positions. 45 , 46 which can be prevented by hydroxyl radical cavengers. 46 In addition, this reaction generates Cr(V), which can ause DNA damage through the same direct and indirect mechaisms discussed earlier in this section, though the relative contriution to the oxidative DNA damage was shown to be much higher or Cr(IV) than for Cr(V). 45 Likewise, Wakeman et al . 47 showed that table complexes of Cr(IV) and Cr(V) induce DNA double-strand reaks in HCT116 cells exposed to these compounds, but Cr(IV) isplayed lower cytotoxicity and higher mutagenicity than Cr(V). 47 aken together, although uncertainties remain, in comparison to r(V), Cr(IV) is (i) a more relevant product of intracellular reducion of Cr(VI) under physiological conditions, (ii) a more potent NA strand breaks-inducing agent, (iii) a more potent source of OH radicals via Fenton-like reaction, and (iv) a more mutagenic nd less cytotoxic agent. These findings suggest that Cr(IV) may e more relevant to Cr(VI)-mediated carcinogenesis than Cr(V). It should be noted that Cr(IV) can produce Cr(V) also by disroportionation (Fig. 4 c) or by a comproportionation reaction with r(VI) (Fig. 4 d). These processes were suggested to be the source f transient Cr(V) detected in some studies performed with cells hat had physiological levels of ascorbate. 11 , 12 However, considerng the higher mutagenicity and lower cytotoxicity of Cr(IV) reltive to Cr(V), 47 the carcinogenic relevance of Cr(V) produced by hese reactions from Cr(IV) remains to be elucidated.\nr(III) r(III) is a thermodynamically stable chromium species produced y the reduction of Cr(VI) with biological reducing agents. This rocess proceeds through intermediary species Cr(V) and Cr(IV) hat transiently exist in variable amounts, depending on the naure of the reducers and other conditions. In the aqueous soutions, Cr(III) salts are typically aquated and form complexes\nFig. 5 Hydrolysis and olation reactions of Cr(III) hexaaqua species in solutions with pH > 4.

Coordinated aqua molecules can hydrolyze to coordinated OH \u2212 and subsequently undergo olation reactions that generate polynuclear complexes with Cr(III) connected by bridging OH groups (Fig. 5 ). 48 Because Cr(III) is a final intracellular form of chromium, the interaction of Cr(III) with DNA has been considered to play a crucial role in the carcinogenicity of Cr(VI). 15 In buffered solutions with pH 6.5\u20137.5, Cr(III) was shown to bind to DNA with 6\u20137 Cr(III) cations bound per 500 DNA base-pairs (bp) at low concentrations ( r = 1:40 Cr: DNA bp), and 30\u201335 Cr(III) cations per 500 bp at higher concentrations ( r = 1:4 Cr: DNA bp). In addition, higher concentrations of Cr(III) induce condensation of DNA starting at a Cr(III): DNA base pair ratio of r = 1:10. 15 Interaction of Cr(III) with DNA is reportedly responsible for the formation of DNA lesions, of which most common are the binary Cr(III)-DNA adducts. 49 These adducts are generated by interactions between DNA and positively charged, labile aqua Cr(III) complexes [Cr(H 2 O) 6-n (OH) n ] (3-n) + , in which OH \u2212 represents a coordinated hydroxide anion produced by the hydrolysis of a coordinated water molecule. Binary Cr-DNA adducts account for 75\u2013 95% of the total DNA-bound chromium in Cr(VI)-treated cells with restored ascorbate levels. 12 However, the level of these adducts may be an overestimate because some of them may have been formed by disruption of ternary ligand-Cr(III)-DNA adducts during DNA isolation. In addition, the typically high concentrations of various ligands available in cells and capable of forming ternary complexes with Cr(III) argue against such a high proportion of the binary adducts. 50 It should be noted, however, that some investigators argue that binary Cr-DNA adducts are not formed by the reaction of Cr(III) complexes with DNA and attribute a more substantial role to Cr(V) than to Cr(III) in the formation of binary DNA adducts. 30 , 51\nThis discrepancy can be likely caused by the different abilities of various Cr(III) complexes to form DNA adducts, which is high for positively charged labile aqua Cr(III) complexes, but low for stable Cr(III)-amino acid complexes. For this reason, Cr(III) complexes with organic ligands, which are formed by intracellular reduction of Cr(VI), may show diminished DNA reactivity. 52 While some fraction of binary Cr(III)-DNA adducts may be formed by the initial interaction of DNA with Cr(V) species, a rapid and extensive formation of binary Cr-DNA adducts in Cr(VI)-treated cells with physiological levels of ascorbate implies that direct interaction of Cr(III) with DNA is at least one of the major mechanisms of the generation of these binary adducts. 11\nThe structure of binary Cr(III)-DNA adducts also remains a subject of ongoing scientific discussion due to conflicting available in-\nformation. At low Cr(III)/DNA ratios (1:80 to 1:20), these adducts reportedly display the structure of chelates, in which Cr(III) binds DNA through guanines and the backbone \u2212PO 2 -groups (Fig. 6 ). 13 , 15\nThe formation of chelates was supported by an in vitro study that examined the reduction of Cr(VI) with ascorbate. The reaction produced adducts that could not be disrupted by phosphate treatment at lower concentrations of ascorbate (0.2 mM) but were unstable at higher concentrations of ascorbate (1 mM). 53 This finding implies a bifunctional mode of Cr(III) binding to DNA, presumably involving N 7 -dG and phosphate groups. In addition, there is the possibility that at least a fraction of Cr(III) could bind through multi-coordinated oligomers. As a result, binary adducts formed at low and high ascorbate levels seem to be different, with the former being resistant and the latter susceptible to phosphate-induced dissociation. 20\nTwo different forms of Cr(III)-DNA adducts were suggested by a study that examined DNAzyme Ce13d reacted with CrCl 3 . The results showed that Cr(III) first binds to the DNA phosphate backbone through weak electrostatic interactions, which can be weakened by inorganic phosphate. In the next step, Cr(III) slowly coordinates with all four nucleobases following the binding kinetics\no l D f n\nc r t s [ t o C d s C m o d a N s\nw w p l c c g n p t c t a p c p c i c b\nC m a t c\np d t d t d s r t d a v\nD T o o t t\na a D m b t n C t t f i t l D c d O D o d c d M\nM v o t r j v n p i t\nl C t a r a l i g i\na C g c t h C\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m etallom ics/article/15/8/m fad045/7231092 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nrder of G > C > T \u2248 A and forms highly stable interstrand crossinks. 54 Arakawa et al . estimated binding constants of Cr(III) with NA in neutral solutions at r = 1:40 to be K = 1.8 \u00d7 10 3 (mol/L) \u22121 or guanine, K = 1.25 \u00d7 10 3 (mol/L) \u22121 for phosphate, and concluded egligible direct binding of Cr(III) to the A-T base pairs. 15\nIn contrast, a more recent study using 14-mer selfomplementary oligodeoxyribonucleotides and low Cr(III)/DNA atios challenged the importance of phosphate groups in he formation of these binary adducts. 55 The results of this tudy supported that Cr(III) is coordinated with N 7 of dG as a Cr(H 2 O) 5 ] + complex, which is located within the major groove of he DNA, without the direct participation of neighboring bases f phosphate groups. 55 However, it is important to note that the rCl 3 .6H 2 O utilized in this study underwent multiple cycles of issolution in D 2 O and heating to dryness to suppress the water ignal interference in the 1 H NMR spectra. The heating labile aqua r(III) complexes results in the hydrolysis of coordinated water olecules into OH groups, subsequently leading to the formation f polynuclear Cr(III) complexes through olation reactions. 56 Aditionally, the reactions between Cr(III) and DNA were performed t low temperatures that do not mimic physiological conditions. otwithstanding these limitations, the preliminary results of this tudy also support the formation of interstrand cross-links. 56\nThe formation of DNA interstrand cross-links is consistent ith increased sensitivity to Cr(VI)-mediated cytotoxicity, which as observed in fibroblasts isolated from a Fanconi anemia (FA) atient. 57 FA cells are known to be hypersensitive to DNA crossinking agents; therefore, DNA cross-linking by Cr(III) or other hromium species generated from Cr(VI) can explain the inreased sensitivity of FA cells to Cr(VI). However, other investiators found no difference in the sensitivity of isogenic FANCD2ull and FANCD2-complemented human fibroblasts with restored hysiological levels of cellular ascorbate in vitro . At the same time, he FANCD2-null cells were significantly more sensitive to DNA ross-linkers mitomycin C and cisplatin. 58 Furthermore, DNA inerstrand cross-links have been detected in DNA exposed to Cr(VI) nd ascorbate at a high Cr(VI) to ascorbate ratio (2:1), but more hysiological ratios of 1: 5 resulted in a substantially reduced DNA ross-linking in vitro . 37 Taken together, these findings do not suport the formation of toxicologically significant amounts of DNA ross-links in cells with restored ascorbate levels exposed to Cr(VI) n vitro . Increased sensitivity of FA cells reported by some studies an be alternatively explained by Cr(VI)-induced oxidative stress ecause FA cells also exhibit an extreme oxidant sensitivity. 59\nIn conclusion, the increased sensitivity of FA fibroblasts to r(VI)-mediated cytotoxicity suggests the formation of Cr(III)ediated interstrand DNA cross-links but also allows for lternative explanations, which would be in line with substanially reduced DNA cross-linking observed in vitro under the physiological ratio of Cr(VI) to ascorbate. Differences among conclusions regarding the role of phoshate in the Cr(III)-DNA adducts likely reflect methodological ifferences among studies. Some of these studies investigated he reactivity of Cr(III) species with DNA under substantially ifferent conditions, and these differences could have influenced he involvement of phosphate in Cr(III)-DNA adducts. Similarly, ifferences in the spectral analytical methods used in these tudies could have led to different conclusions. In addition, eactions of Cr(III) complexes with DNA are likely not sufficient o elucidate the structure of Cr(III)-DNA adducts because they o not seem to reflect all possible interactions between DNA nd chromium species that occur during Cr(VI) reductions with ariable amounts of intracellular reducers.\nInterestingly, despite the clear evidence for Cr(III) binding to NA, Cr(III) does not affect the affinity of mitoxantrone to DNA. his finding can be explained by the difference between modes f DNA binding for Cr(III) and mitoxantrone. Indeed, the binding f Cr(III) to guanine in the major groove of DNA is not expected o interfere with the intercalation of mitoxantrone at CpG sites in he minor groove of DNA. 16\nBinary Cr(III)-DNA adducts can further conjugate proteins nd form DPCs. The DPCs represent ternary protein-Cr(III)-DNA dducts generated by a rate-limiting reaction of binary Cr(III)NA adducts with proteins. In contrast to aldehydes, the Cr(III)ediated formation of DPCs does not require stable protein-DNA inding prior to the cross-linking reaction. Indeed, the major proein cross-linked to DNA in CHO cells treated with Cr(VI) is the on-DNA-binding protein actin and not DNA-binding histones. 60 onsistent with this finding, binding of Cr(III) to proteins occurs hrough Cys, His, Glu, and Asp residues and not through posiively charged Lys and Arg residues that are typically involved in orming stable DNA-protein complexes. The formation of DPCs n cultured cells exposed to Cr(VI) is decreased by the depleion of glutathione and facilitated by the restoration of physioogical levels of ascorbate. 61 In vitro , reactions of Cr(VI) produced PCs in the presence of one-electron-donating reducers (GSH, ysteine), but also a two-electron donating ascorbate, which inicates the dispensable role of Cr(V) in the formation of DPCs. 61\nn the other hand, the role of Cr(III) in cross-linking proteins to NA was shown to be critical through the ability of phosphate r EDTA, respectively, to fully or partially dissociate DPCs prouced by chromate in mixtures containing bovine serum albumin, alf thymus DNA and 1 mM ascorbate. 61 Furthermore, Cr(III) also emonstrated the ability to form DPCs in isolated nuclei of the OLT4 cells exposed to chromium (III) chloride. 62\nIt should be noted, however, that a study of Cr(VI)-treated OLT4 cells found that only \u223c19% of Cr(VI)-induced DPCs inolved Cr(III) cross-linking DNA to proteins. The remaining 81% f DPCs appeared to be formed by oxidative cross-linking of proeins to DNA. 62 Interestingly, these results are not consistent with esults reported by Miller and Costa, 63 who found that the maority of DNA-associated proteins in Cr(VI)-exposed CHO cells inolve Cr(III) and could be displaced by EDTA. A plausible explaation for this inconsistency implies that EDTA generally has a oor ability to chelate Cr(III); therefore, Cr(III) can be involved n cross-linking even in DPCs resistant to dissociation by EDTA reatment. 11\nOverall, chromate-induced DPCs are relatively rare lesions, at east initially, due to their delayed formation compared to other r-induced DNA lesions. 11 However, the DPCs are more persisent than smaller Cr-DNA adducts because these DPCs are not menable to nucleotide excision repair, 64 which is a principal epair mechanism for the removal of other Cr-mediated DNA dducts. 65 Consequently, DPCs likely become more prevalent at ater postexposure times. 12 However, their biological significance s still incompletely understood. In addition to inducing possible enotoxic responses, some studies demonstrated their ability to nhibit specific gene expression. 61\nOther ternary adducts identified in the cells exposed to Cr(VI) re ascorbate-Cr(III)-DNA, glutathione-Cr(III)-DNA, cysteiner(III)-DNA, histidine-Cr(III)-DNA, glutamate-Cr(III)-DNA, and lutamine-Cr(III)-DNA. 66 , 67 Examination of the reactivity of omplexes formed by Cr(III) and amino acids demonstrated that hese ternary adducts are formed from Cr(III)-cysteine or Cr(III)istidine complexes attacking DNA and not from the binary r(III)-DNA adducts. 67 Notably, some research suggests that a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m etallom ics/article/15/8/m fad045/7231092 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nsignificant portion of cysteine-Cr(III)-DNA adducts in chromatetreated CHO cells originated from glutathione cross-links. 68\nLikewise, cross-linking of ascorbate to DNA was consistent with the attack of DNA by transient Cr(III)-ascorbate complexes. Inhibition of the formation of ascorbate-Cr(III)-DNA cross-links by Mg 2 + ions suggests that ascorbate-Cr(III) predominantly binds to DNA through phosphate oxygen. 20 Ascorbate-Cr(III)-DNA adducts were detected in Cr(VI)-treated human lung A549 cells with restored ascorbate levels, and these cross-links accounted for approximately 6% of the total DNA-bound chromium. 20\nOf note, Cr(III)-mediated aggregation of DNA has also been observed in vitro , but only at high Cr(III)/DNA ratios that are unlikely to have biological relevance. 55\nThe binding of Cr(III) and the formation of Cr(III)-DNA adducts induces structural distortions of DNA. 69 Cr(III) also appears to influence transitions between B-DNA and Z-DNA conformers induced by other reagents. Unlike the more frequent right-handed B-DNA, Z-DNA is a left-handed double helical conformation transiently and occasionally induced in biological systems. 70 The toxicological significance of this finding is still not fully understood because this effect was only shown in synthetic polynucleotides and in the presence of ethanol, while another study using calf thymus DNA did not support the Cr(III)-mediated induction of conformational transitions from B to A or B to Z DNA structures. 13\nLastly, Cr(III) was reported to react with hydrogen peroxide in Fenton-like reactions (Fig. 4 e) and produce hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen that can cause oxidative damage to DNA. 71 The Cr(IV) produced in this reaction can subsequently undergo other redox reactions and form Cr(V). Oxidation of Cr(III) by hydrogen peroxide can reportedly occur at neutral or near-alkaline pH 72 ; however, the role of trace iron contamination in Cr(III) salts in the observed generation of hydroxyl radicals cannot be ruled out. In addition, the formation of hydroxyl radicals and DNA strand breaks can be reduced by the presence of ascorbate and glutathione (both reduced and oxidized), 71 as well as other biomolecules such as histidine, glutamine, serine, or citrate that can form complexes with Cr(III). 73 Considering thermodynamic and kinetic limitations, the extent to which this reaction might occur with in vivo exposures is uncertain. 71\nBiological effects of Cr-DNA interactions Depending on the conditions, exposure of cells to Cr(VI) can result in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, cell senescence, cell death, and mutagenesis. These processes have been associated to various extents with multiple DNA lesions, including binary Cr-DNA adducts, ternary ligand-Cr-DNA adducts, interstrand DNA crosslinks, DPCs, oxidatively damaged 2-deoxyribose and nucleobases, DNA strand breaks, and DNA abasic sites. 15 , 43 , 67\nBinary Cr(III)-DNA adducts are reportedly weakly mutagenic, and their mutagenic potential is considerably lower than that of the ternary ligand-Cr-DNA adducts. 22 Indeed, ternary adducts ascorbate-Cr(III)-DNA and cysteine-Cr(III)-DNA were found to be 31- and 5.3-fold more mutagenic than the binary Cr(III)-DNA adducts, respectively. 69 , 74 Similarly, l -ascorbate, the most important intracellular reducer of Cr(VI), was also reported to form mutagenic DNA adducts. Likewise, the ternary adducts glutathione-Cr(III)-DNA and histidine-Cr(III)-DNA were also found to be mutagenic, and their mutagenicity reportedly exceeded that of cysteine-Cr(III)-DNA 75 ; nevertheless, the toxicological importance of glutathione-Cr(III)-DNA adducts in vivo may be limited because of their reduced formation in cells\nwith physiological levels of ascorbate. Notably, the formation of mutagenic glutathione-Cr(III)-DNA adducts is limited even in the absence of ascorbate. This was shown by treating pSP189 plasmids with Cr(VI) in MOPS buffer in the presence of physiological levels of GSH. Under these conditions, the ternary glutathioneCr(III)-DNA adducts represented only \u223c5% of all DNA-bound chromium, and the Cr(VI)-treated plasmid produced only weak mutagenic responses when replicated in human fibroblasts. 76 This finding explains the weak mutagenicity of Cr(VI) observed under physiological concentrations of GSH in ascorbate-deficient cells. 76 Given this finding and the strong mutagenicity of ternary ascorbate-Cr(III)-DNA adducts, 22 it suggests that studies employing standard cell cultures with low intracellular ascorbate could underestimate the mutagenicity of Cr(VI). Taken together, based on these in vitro findings, studies performed under nonphysiological, low ascorbate levels appear to favor the production of Cr(V), the formation of more stable Cr-DNA adducts, and a lower amount of highly mutagenic ternary species, which may not truly reflect the genotoxic and mutagenic effects of Cr(VI). 53\nCells with restored ascorbate levels display considerably different cell signaling responses to Cr(VI) than ascorbate-depleted cells. Human H460 epithelial cancer cells and human IMR90 normal lung fibroblasts exposed to Cr(VI) under standard cell culture conditions without restoration of intracellular ascorbate displayed activation of ATM, which was demonstrated by phosphorylation of its three well-defined targets: ATM (autophosphorylation at Ser1981), CHK2 (Thr68) and KAP1 (Ser824). In contrast, cells with fully restored physiological levels of ascorbate did not show activation of ATM signaling. 77 Activation of ATM correlated with the extent of GSH-mediated reduction of Cr(VI), which is a dominant reductive process in ascorbate-depleted cells. ATM activation is typically triggered by DNA double-strand breaks, 78 which can be formed by oxidative DNA damage through DNA base or sugar damage leading to single-strand breaks and subsequently to double-strand breaks. 79\nAs previously shown, the reduction of Cr(VI) by glutathione in vitro in cells with depleted ascorbate leads to the appreciable formation of Cr(V) that can act as an oxidant. 22 In contrast, the reduction of Cr(VI) by ascorbate is a low oxidant-generating process. 26 Treatment with Cr(VI) also induces DNA double-strand breaks in cells with restored ascorbate; however, these are formed selectively in euchromatin, and their signaling depends on ATR rather than ATM kinase. 80 The formation of DSBs in euchromatin is potentially more deleterious than their formation in heterochromatin because it increases the probability of gene deletions and translocations affecting active tumor suppressors. 78\nSimilarly, ternary adducts were also found to be more genotoxic than binary Cr(III)-DNA adducts. This was demonstrated through a more prominent DNA replication blocking by ternary adducts compared to binary adducts. For instance, ascorbate-Cr(III)-DNA adducts displayed more potent replication-blocking activity than Cr(III)-DNA adducts, 81 and modification of pSP189 plasmid DNA in the presence of 0.2 mM Cr(VI) to 1 mM ascorbate generated sufficient levels of DNA lesions to block replication of > 99.5% of these plasmids. 22 Reduced processivity of DNA polymerases and guanine-specific polymerase arrests were observed in several studies in vitro that used Cr-modified DNA as a template. Polymerase-arresting DNA lesions were detected in vitro following reactions of Cr(III) or Cr(VI) with DNA in the presence of ascorbate and attributed to bifunctional adducts of Cr(III) with DNA phosphate groups. 82 Similarly, treatment of normal human lung fibroblasts with Cr(VI) that produced adduct levels of 0.13\u20130.92 mmol Cr/mol DNA led to guanine-specific DNA replication termination\na i\nw m a t b t p t i\nt s i i\ne s D p m a a c g D c p c b s\ni a c r b b e t i T t p T m C s a r n R a g M M s t T l\no e\nC C s i\nt D f l\nt C C l w a a r p a\nt i a f o f s s p\nu t l s m m a\nl m t f r b p o\ni i c t p r w o t t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m etallom ics/article/15/8/m fad045/7231092 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nnd cell cycle arrest in S-phase, which were attributed to dG-dG nterstrand cross-links. 83\nBridgewater et al . 37 reported DNA replication arrest in vitro hen the ratio of Cr(VI) to ascorbate was high (2:1) and a uch-decreased replication arrest when the ratio of Cr(VI) to scorbate was low (1:5). This study attributed replication lesions o DNA interstrand cross-linking. 37 A similar finding was reported y O\u2019Brien et al ., who also attributed the DNA replication arrest o interstrand DNA cross-links, in which Cr(III) was bound to two hosphate groups in the DNA. 82 These investigators also showed he decreased formation of interstrand cross-links with increasng ratios of ascorbate: Cr(VI). 82\nIn conclusion, DNA replication arrest has been attributed to ernary ligand-Cr(III)-DNA adducts and to Cr(III)-mediated intertrand cross-links at dG positions. Of note, the formation of the nterstrand cross-links is expected to be limited under physiologcal conditions with high intracellular ascorbate: Cr(VI) ratio. 82\nIn contrast to the replication arrest observed at higher levls of DNA-bound Cr(III), low levels of DNA-bound Cr(III) were hown to increase DNA polymerase processivity but also decrease NA replication fidelity and induce mutations in replicated M13 hage DNA. 81 , 84 Moreover, low levels of Cr(III) increased polyerase bypass in oxidatively damaged DNA exposed to Cr(III) in cell-free system. 84 Intriguingly, low levels of Cr(III) binding were lso found to stimulate the mutagenic incorporation of dTTP nuleotide opposite to 6-O-methylguanine sites. 85 Methylation at the uanine O 6 position is caused by nitrosoureas and some other NA-methylating agents and represents a highly mutagenic and arcinogenic DNA lesion. 86 Taken together, these findings suport the mutagenic effects of Cr(III)-induced DNA lesions through hanged kinetics and fidelity of DNA replication and imply that inding of Cr(III) to DNA might also enhance the mutagenicity of ome DNA alkylating agents. Lower mutagenicity of Cr(VI) in cells with depleted l -ascorbate mplies that cell context is important for DNA-chromium interctions and determines the cell fate of Cr(VI)-exposed cells. This oncept is supported by other studies, including a study that eported the formation of DNA cross-links but not DNA strand reaks in liver cells and the formation of DNA strand breaks ut not DNA cross-links in red blood cells in 14-day old chick mbryos treated with Cr(VI). 87 These findings suggest cell and issue-specific effects of Cr(VI), which can include differences n DNA lesions and cell responses across different tissue types. hese differences may reflect different intracellular concentraions of reductants, but they can also be caused by differing caabilities of cells for DNA repair and other cellular processes. his was demonstrated by the increased mutation rate in misatch repair (MMR)-impaired MLH1 -deficient cells exposed to r(VI) compared to MLH1 -proficient cells. 47 The functioning MMR ystem, which recognizes and repairs single-base mispairs, plays n essential role in activating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in esponse to some DNA-damaging agents, such as N-methyl-Nitrosourea, cisplatin, and Cr(VI). In a study reported by Petersonoth et al ., HCT116 cells that were stably transfected with MLH1 nd preloaded with physiological levels of ascorbate exhibited reater sensitivity to Cr(VI)-mediated cytotoxicity than isogenic LH1 -deficient cells. 88 This suggests that cells with impaired MR due to genetic or epigenetic changes may be more likely to urvive under chronic exposures to Cr(VI), which could lead to heir selection and development of tumors with deficient MMR. his mechanism is consistent with the observed higher prevaence of microsatellite instability 89 and higher methylation level\nf MLH1 promoter in lung cancers from chromate-exposed workrs compared to those without chromate exposure. 90\nonclusions r(VI) is a carcinogen that undergoes reductive metabolic converion to DNA-reactive species and can cause DNA adducts and oxdative DNA damage. 1\nThe complexity of the effects of Cr(VI) on DNA stems from (i) he remarkably intricate chromium chemistry, (ii) the variety of NA lesions that can be induced by different species under diferent conditions, and (iii) the variety of cell responses to these esions. The complex chemistry of chromium can be demonstrated by he existence of four oxidation states, Cr(VI), Cr(V), Cr(IV), and r(III), that can be found in the biological systems exposed to r(VI). Each of these oxidation states can form various molecuar species. These species can undergo redox reactions and react ith a variety of biologically relevant molecules, including DNA, nd cause diverse types of DNA damage directly through DNA rectivity and/or indirectly through the generation of ROS. For these easons, chromium-DNA interactions are considerably more comlex than interactions between DNA and other DNA-reactive gents, including DNA alkylators and platinum complexes. 91\nBecause of the rich chemistry, diversity of experimental condiions, and range of analytical methods used in the existing studes, specific types of DNA damage have not yet been conclusively ttributed to specific Cr species or reactive byproducts produced rom Cr(VI) in biological systems. Consequently, the potential role f each species in Cr(VI)-mediated carcinogenesis has not yet been ully elucidated and continues to be a subject of ongoing discusions in the field. It is possible that DNA-reactive Cr species and ome free radicals may be important to both the initiation and romotion of carcinogenesis by Cr(VI) compounds. Available evidence supports that the exposure of cells to Cr(VI) nder physiological conditions results in the intracellular upake and reduction of Cr(VI). This reduction is accomplished by -ascorbate and, to a lesser extent, by GSH. Of the two transient pecies generated by these reductions, Cr(IV) is more reactive, ore mutagenic, and less cytotoxic than Cr(V) and likely plays a ore significant role than Cr(V) in the Cr(VI)-induced DNA damge observed in various experimental systems. In cells exposed to Cr(VI) with physiological levels of -ascorbate, most DNA-bound chromium is in the form of weakly utagenic binary Cr-DNA adducts. However, the strongly genooxic and mutagenic ligand-Cr-DNA ternary adducts are also ormed under these conditions and likely play a substantial ole in Cr-mediated carcinogenesis. Likewise, DNA single-strand reaks/alkali labile sites and abasic sites may also be imortant in the induction of mutagenic and clastogenic effects f Cr(VI). 92\nCell context has been shown to play a role in chromium-DNA nteractions in cells exposed to Cr(VI) through different levels of ntracellular reductants and different DNA repair capacities of ells or other cellular processes. The higher mutagenicity and cyotoxicity observed when cells with impaired DNA mismatch reair are exposed to Cr(VI) 47 has additional potential public health elevance because it implies higher susceptibility of individuals ith the constitutional mismatch repair deficiencies syndrome to ccupational or environmental exposures to Cr(VI). In conclusion, he presently available data provide only an incomplete picture of he interactions between DNA and various Cr-species formed in\nC4OB00382A\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m etallom ics/article/15/8/m fad045/7231092 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\ncells exposed to Cr(VI). For this reason, this \u201cchromium saga\u201d will likely continue."
