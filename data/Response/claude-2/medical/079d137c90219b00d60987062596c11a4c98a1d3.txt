 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further investigate the molecular mechanisms by which lactic acidosis reprograms cancer cell metabolism, such as signaling pathways and transcriptional regulation. This could reveal new therapeutic targets. 

2. Explore combinatorial therapies that pair inhibitors of lactic acidosis effect (e.g. MCT1 inhibitors) with inhibitors of glycolysis or other cancer cell survival pathways. This could enhance treatment efficacy.

3. Study intratumoral heterogeneity of metabolism in more detail by analyzing different tumor regions. This could help refine models of metabolic symbiosis between cell subpopulations. 

4. Investigate interactions between hypoxia, lactic acidosis and metabolic phenotypes over time. This could provide insight into the dynamics of metabolic adaptations.

5. Evaluate the efficacy of lactic acidosis inhibition in additional cancer types beyond hepatocellular carcinoma. Expanding the range of cancers tested would demonstrate broader applicability.
