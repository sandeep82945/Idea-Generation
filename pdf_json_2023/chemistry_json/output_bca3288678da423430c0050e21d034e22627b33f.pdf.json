    "abstractText": "The phenomenon of ordered self-assembly on solid substrates is a topic of interest in both fundamental surface science research and its applications in nanotechnology. The regulation and control of two-dimensional (2D) self-assembled supra-molecular structures on surfaces have been realized through applying external stimuli. By utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), researchers can investigate the detailed phase transition process of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), providing insight into the interplay between intermolecular weak interactions and substrate\u2013molecule interactions, which govern the formation of molecular self-assembly. This review will discuss the structural transition of self-assembly probed by STM in response to external stimuli and provide state-of-the-art methods such as tip-induced confinement for the alignment of SAM domains and selective chirality. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in the field of self-assembly and STM.",

            "text": "With the increasing need for downsizing in the electronics industry, the development of molecular electronic devices presents a promising solution to overcome the limitations imposed by silicon-based electronics [1,2]. The conventional silicon electronics has relied on lithographic patterning of polymer resists at progressively smaller lengths to scale down device dimensions. However, this approach has its limitations. In response, numerous fabrication techniques have been explored to create molecular electronic devices, resulting in significant advancements in fabrication, characterization, and application within this field [3\u20135]. One of the hottest topics is to recognize and manipulate the functions and lateral structures of molecules at the nanoscale during two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular self-assembly process [6]. Molecular self-assembly is a spontaneous process [7\u20139], during which molecules are held together into ordered structures via intra- and intermolecular non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding [10,11], van der Waals force [12], \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking [13,14] and electrostatic force [15,16]. In assistance of an atomically flat substrate, 2D self-assembled networks can be stabilized on the surface of the substrate based on the noncovalent interactions between molecules and substrates under thermodynamic control. In order to tune the functions and structures, the ordered 2D patterns can go through a structural and functional transition into another one with external stimuli, such as solvents [17\u201319], thermal treatment [20,21], varying concentrations [22,23], light irradiation [24], electric field [25,26], and guest-molecule-induced co-adsorption and desorption processes [27,28]. Since its invention in 1981, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has proven to be a powerful technique for visualizing 2D materials and molecular networks, providing direct proofs for the way of molecular bonding and phase transition at the solid\u2013liquid\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4176. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15204176 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4176 2 of 14\ninterface [29]. Owing to this significant contribution, Gerd Binning and Heinrich Rohrer were awarded with the Nobel Prize of Physics in 1986. The principle of STM is simple. When an atomically sharp conductive STM tip is close enough to a conductive substrate, a tunneling current is generated through the tip and the substrate upon applying a sufficient voltage. The tunneling current exponentially changes with the distance between the tip apex and the measured atom on the substrate. Based on the relationship between the tunneling current and the distance, a STM image with atomic resolution can be generated when the tip is scanning over the substrate. Therefore, STM can be very useful to monitor the molecular structure formed during self-assembly, molecular dynamics under thermodynamics and surface chirality. Furthermore, external forces from the STM tip or flow can also be applied to trigger the phase transition process of self-assembled molecular networks. In this contribution, we focus on the recent progress of controlling the external stimuli to achieve state-of-the-art manipulation of phase transition of 2D molecular networks probed by STM at the solid\u2013liquid interface, including temperature, electric field, photoirradiation, shear-flow, and tip induction."

            "text": "As the molecular self-assembly process is governed under thermodynamic control [30\u201332], thermal treatment is a critical factor to manipulate the phase transition process of 2D molecular networks. Moreover, thermal treatment is a widely recognized process that can lead to the creation of an organized adlayer or the development of a new thermodynamically stable structure, or result in the expansion of the domain size [33]. Azzam et al. demonstrated a continuous decrease in the surface coverage of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of terphenylethanethiol on Au (111) and dramatic alterations in the substrate morphology caused by the partial desorption of molecules with elevated temperatures [34]. Interestingly, the SAMs of terphenylethanethiol experienced a consecutive \u03b1-\u03b2-\u03b3-\u03b4 phase transitions upon thermal annealing from the room temperature up to 468 K. At the room temperature, a densely packed a \u03b1 phase with a(\n2 \u221a 3\u00d7 \u221a 3 ) R30\u25e6 structure was observed on the Au (111) substrate, while it changed to a \u03b2\nphase with a ( 3 \u221a 3\u00d7 5 )\nstructure, associated with the appearance of irregular gold islands, upon annealing at 333 K. Further annealing to 373 K promoted the formation of a \u03b3 phase with a (2 \u221a 5\u00d7 4 ) R7\u25e6 structure. A final \u03b4 phase (2 \u221a 5\u00d7 \u221a 7 )\nR13\u25e6 appeared upon annealing at the temperature higher than 468 K. The packing density of the molecules continuously decreased with the phase transition at higher temperatures due to the thermal-induced partial desorption of molecules. Similarly, De Feyter et al. realized the temperature-induced structural phase transition between a closely arranged linear and a loosely packed porous phase of SAMs of alkylated dehydrobenzo [12] annulene (DBA) derivative on a graphite substrate. Figure 1a and b showed the chemical structure of DBA-OC16 and the corresponding molecular model of the interlocking arrangement of alkoxy chains between neighboring DBA-OC16 molecules. Following this way, the DBA-OC16 molecules were expected to form linear and porous phases on a flat substrate. At the room temperature, the DBA molecules were co-adsorbed with solvent molecules (1,2,4-trichlorobenzene) as the guests on a graphite surface and arranged into porous structure [20], Figure 1c. Based on thermal annealing up to 353 K, the solvent molecules were evaporated from the pores and the structure were stabilized as a closely packed linear phase under entropic and enthalpic control, Figure 1c. Furthermore, thermal treatment can also help induce the switch of chirality of SAMs. At the room temperature high concentration of chiral DBA(S) molecules appeared on the graphite surface with the co-existence of 81% clockwise (CW) and 19% counter-clockwise (CCW) porous patterns. However, annealing at 80 \u25e6C converted the original phases to a homochiral SAMs of CCW pattern by coalescence of domains through a ripening process, which is because that the guests DBA(S) molecules acting as guests preferentially stayed in CCW pores to form stable host\u2013guest systems [35]. Additionally, thermal annealing can also help conduct the trans\u2013cis transformation of SAMs. Wan et al. investigated the\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4176 3 of 14\ntemperature effect on the self-assembly behavior of bis(4,4\u2032-(m,m\u2019-di(dodecyloxy)phenyl)2,2\u2032-difluoro-1,3,2-dioxaborine) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) [36]. Firstly, a lamellar structure with trans conformation was observed on the HOPG surface at the room temperature with two dioxaborine (DOB) moieties aligned in a dihedral angle of 180 degree. When the temperature was lifted to 100 \u25e6C, the quality of the SAMs was improved with long-range ordering of molecular arrays. Heating at 130 \u25e6C triggered the trans\u2013cis transformation and a small region with hexagonal structure of cis isomer of the molecules was observed. When heating at 150 \u25e6C, the domain of hexagonal structure of cis isomers expanded and eventually accomplished the complete trans\u2013cis transformation by covering the entire surface. Over the course of the past few decades, thermal treatment was mainly applied to the 2D phase transition of SAMs, which lack real applications in the field of nanotechnology. Recently, 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) [37,38] and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) [39\u201341], have become cutting-edge research fields due to their wide-range applications. Surprisingly, thermal treatment has been proven an effective method for the promotion of on-surface synthesis processes to form large-area 2D COFs and GNRs. For example, Shi et al. developed a three-step annealing process for the synthesis of 2D COF starting from 4-bromo-4\u201d-chloro-5\u2032-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1\u2032 : 3\u2032,1\u201d-terphenyl (BCCTP) monomer, which has two chloride ends and one bromide end [37]. The BCCTP monomers selectively react with each other at the bromide end to form dimers on the Au (111) substrate at 180 \u25e6C. Subsequently, in assistance of Cu, oligomers were formed by annealing at 140 \u25e6C for 10 min. Further annealing at 280 \u25e6C for 30 min promotes the formation of 2D covalent frameworks. The utilization of a hierarchical process of selective reactivity presents a potentially valuable approach for achieving the thermodynamic product and minimizing kinetic trapping during the synthesis of 2D COFs.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 14\nhomochiral SAMs of CCW pattern by coalescence of domains through a ripening process,\nwhich is because that the guests DBA(S) molecules acting as guests preferentially stayed\nin CCW pores to form stable host\u2013guest systems [35].

            "text": "Recently, surface photochemistry has been intensively studied, due to its powerful function for tunning SAMs\u2019 ordering and initiating on-surface polymerization, including photoisomerization [42,43], photopolymerization [44,45] and photocycloaddition [46,47]. The SAM adlayer normally experiences significant structural changes as a result of surface photochemical reactions, primarily due to the substantial structural disparity between the photo-active molecules before and after the photo-induction. Pace et al. observed the lightinduced SAM phase transition of azobenzene molecules on the Au (111) substrate with STM images. The transformation of the trans-form of SAM to the cis-form was promoted by 360 nm light irradiation, while the reversed transition was performed by 450 nm light irradiation [48]. Later, Tahara et al. investigated the photo-induced phase transition of SAMs in a more complex system, involving a photo-induced guest adsorption and desorption process [49]. The schematic illustration clearly demonstrated the photo-induced guest adsorption and desorption process in DBA pores, see Figure 2a. Firstly, the trans-form azobenzene-functionalized DBA self-assembled into a hexagonal porous structure at the 1-octanoicacid/graphite interface, see Figure 2b. After adding the coronene guest molecules into the system, one of each coronene molecule was immobilized in one pore formed by the trans-azobenzene-functionalized DBA, see Figure 2c. Upon light-irradiation at 320 nm, the trans-to-cis transformation occurred with desorption of one or two azobenzene units from the substrate surface, which left sufficient space for the accommodation of additional coronene guest molecules in the pores, see Figure 2d. Reversely, applying a light-irradiation at 400\u2013430 nm initiated the cis-to-trans transformation, which promoted the re-adsorption of the trans-molecules onto the substrate surface and excluded the extra guest molecules. Yokoyama et al. demonstrated the investigation of photo-activated structural switch behavior of a photochromic terthiophene derivative with STM at the solid\u2013liquid interface [50]. No ordered structure was observed for the closed-ring phase of a terthiophene derivative, while it underwent a phase transition to two ordered phases (\u03b1-ordering and \u03b2-ordering) due to the visible-light-induced ring opening of the terthiophene derivative. When UV light was used for the photo-induction, a third ordered phase (\u03b3-ordering) appeared due to the formation of the annulated isomer. It is also possible to control the conductance of molecular electronics via light-irradiation-induced opening and closing of the ring of the thiophene unit of SAM on Au substrate. A reversible conversion between two distinguishable conductance states can be controlled via photoisomerization of the switches by using alternative irradiation with UV (\u03bb = 313 nm) or visible (\u03bb > 420 nm) light to achieve the on-state and off-state, respectively. This transition process was clearly probed by the STM images, showing the distinct height difference between the one-state (0.4\u20130.6 nm) and off-state of the molecules (0\u20130.1 nm) [51]. Recently, photo-induction has been combined with the STM technique to generate a STM junction for building ultrafast photon-induced tunneling microscopy [52]. Photon-induced tunneling currents were successfully generated and detected by differential conductance (dI/dV) measurement of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) molecules with STM setup upon laser pulse induction. Angstrom scale spatial resolution and sub-femtosecond temporal resolution were simultaneously accomplished, which opened a new avenue to the study of molecular electron dynamic behavior in intricate systems, with no necessity of reconstruction techniques.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4176 5 of 14Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 14\nFigure 2.

Self-Assembled Structures Controlled by Voltage Induction\nAn electric field is an efficient way to control the surface self-assembly process of\nmolecules. The surface structural transition influenced by the electric field is indicative of\nthe modulation of the interaction between the substrate and the molecule, as well as po-\ntential changes in intermolecular interactions, which normally lead to the order\u2013disorder\ntransition, surface coverage manipulation and polymorph switch.

Cai et al. formed a SAM of 1,3,5-tris(4-biphenylboronic acid)benzene (TBPBA) on\nHOPG with a closely packed structure under ambient conditions with a positive bias volt-\nage applied to the substrates and the molecules [54]. When the substrate and the molecules\nwere applied with negative bias voltage, the noncovalently bonded TBPBA molecules\nwere arranged into a loosely packed porous structure with the co-adsorption of 1-octanoic\nacid solvent molecules as the guests inside the cores and more interestingly the boronic\nacid groups of each TBPBA molecule formed covalent bonds with the three adjacent mol-\necules. The electric-field-induced phase transition between the SAM and COF was totally\nreversable independent of the polarity of the applied bias voltage.

The surface structural transition influenced by the electric field is indicative of the modulation of the interaction between the substrate and the molecule, as well as potential changes in intermolecular interactions, which normally lead to the order\u2013disorder transition, surface coverage manipulation and polymorph switch.

            "text": "The manipulation of the spatial organization of molecular components on surfaces is a crucial aspect in the bottom-up approach for the development of nanotechnologies. The supramolecular self-assembly process offers a promising method for constructing ordered patterns through the spontaneous arrangement of specifically designed molecular building blocks. However, this process involves intricate intermolecular, intramolecular, and molecule\u2013substrate interactions, which are challenging to control. As a result, it often leads to the formation of polycrystalline or amorphous structures at the sub-micrometer scale. Recently, the shear flow method was introduced to align macromolecules and liquid crystalline polymers [59\u201361]. Inspired by this, Lee et al. introduced an applicable shear-flow method for globally guiding the self-assembly behavior of building blocks by dragging the building block containing solution with a piece of ultra-clean tissue following a certain direction to induce the long-range alignment of 2D nanopatterns of SAM of 3,6,11,14-tetradodecyloxydibenzo[g,p]-chrysene (DBC) [62]. Before shear-treatment, the DBC molecules formed a typical face-on orientation for polyaromatic molecules, while it transformed into an edge-on orientation with the molecules aligned following the [01 10] direction of the HOPG substrate. This transition can be clearly indicated by the alteration of the lattice parameters of adlayer and the spacing reduction on the neighboring molecules from 1.7 to 0.5 nm. Remarkably, this method allows the formation of DBC molecules with a singular domain up to \u223c7 mm. Dragging the solution along the direction parallel to the unit cell vectors of HOPG is critical to fabricate such a large domain with a unique alignment, otherwise multiple small domains can be formed following the three main symmetric axes of HOPG due to the strong molecule\u2013substrate interactions. Furthermore, the aligned SAM was able to maintain its arrangement by overcoming the local defects on the substrate such as step-edges. However, the existence of many defective areas within the long-range ordered SAM remained as a big issue, which determined the quality of the SAM-based molecular electronics. The authors optimized the SAM quality using a different molecular system, in which the oligomer molecules self-assembled in the solution phase into ordered 1D chains following the main symmetric axes of the substrate due to the strong molecule\u2013substrate interactions [63]. The shear-flow treatment converted the directional multiple domains into a unidirectionally singular domain following the flow direction with ultra-low defective areas less than 0.5%, compared to that of 5% without the treatment. The spatial ordering control was further extended to the third dimension by controlling the alignment of the multilayer molecular assembly process. Lee et al. used SAM of hexarylene diimide (HDI) as an example for demonstrating the multilayer alignment via shear flow [64]. Without any external induction, HDI formed a linear structure with many small domains on the first layer following the three main symmetric axes of HOPG and misaligned multilayers, see Figure 4a. With the first-step shear flow treatment with the flow direction perpendicular to the linear rods, the small domains on the first layer merged as a large and unidirectional domain with the molecules on the multilayer remaining misaligned, see Figure 4b. Following the second-step shear\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4176 8 of 14\nflow treatment with the flow direction parallel to the linear rods, the molecules on the multilayers were also unidirectionally aligned according to the flow directions, see Figure 4c. Surprisingly, Elemans et al. also managed to form well-ordered SAM of porphyrin trimers with an ultra-large domain size in millimeter scale, upon applying macroscopic dewetting of the solvent to create a flow force for the guidance of the porphyrin macrocycles SAM alignment [65]. This method was proven to be effective for directing the formation of large-domain liquid crystals.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 14\naligned according to the flow directi ns, se Figure 4c.

The energy provided through the STM tip pulsing was responsible for the transformation of SAM configurations. Recently, the STM tip has been used as a nanolithography tool to remove certain grafted defects on substrates for the selective mergence and alignment of SAM molecular domains. Bragan\u00e7a et al. observed the phenomena that the large domains of SAM of 5-octadecyloxy-isophthalic acid (ISA-OC18) on HOPG were interrupted into small pieces by the covalently grafted low-density diazonium molecules [68]. These grafted molecules worked as domain boundaries for the containment of the domain size of SAM. The selective Ostwald ripening process, characterized by the growth of larger domains at the expense of smaller ones, was achieved by precisely removing specific grafted molecules located on the boundaries of the domains using the STM tip. Following a similar strategy, a fully grafted substrate was nano-shaved by the STM tip to create nano-corrals for further space-confined self-assembly process. The tip-induced confinement effect has a significant impact on the self-assembly behavior of molecules, including the alignment of domains, selective chirality and phase transition of SAMs. For example, Verstraete et al. used HOPG with high-density grafting of diazonium molecules as a template, on which well-defined and stable patterns can be formed for studying the ex situ and in situ self-assembly behavior of molecules via nano-shaving with the STM tip [69]. The categorization of ex situ and in situ were defined by the absence or presence of 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) solution on the substrate surface during the nano-shaving process. On a pristine HOPG (unconfined), the PCDA molecules formed a linear structure following the three main symmetric axes of HOPG with multiple domains, as expected. In an ex situ corral with 180 nm \u00d7 180 nm size, the self-assembly behavior of PCDA is similar to that on the unconfined HOPG and no alignment effect was observed. For comparison, the PCDA molecules aligned unidirectionally following their molecular long axis to form a large domain in the in situ corral. Additionally, the tip-created chirality in these nano-corrals were useful to build chiral surfaces for biasing the enantiomorphic assembly of a prochiral molecule during the self-assembly process. In Figure 5, Seibel et al. demonstrated the possibility of using nanoconfined corrals with different chirality for the induction of selective adsorption of chiral polymorphs [70]. Figure 5a showed that self-assembly of prochiral 5-octadecyloxyisophthalic acid (ISA-OC18) molecules into chiral lamellae with interdigitated alkyl-chains was observed with S (left) or R (right) chirality according to their tilt direction. These chiral lamellae preferentially adsorb on the HOPG surface to form L or R domains, which can be classified by the tilt direction with respect to the [210] surface direction of HOPG, see Figure 5b. The large-area and small-area STM images in Figure 5c,d showed an equivalent adsorption of L and R domains on the surface without any confinement. Figure 5g showed that no chiral biasing effect was observed during the self-assembly of ISA-OC18 in achiral nano-corrals based on a large number of statistical analyses. However, when the nanocorrals were created with different chirality by adjusting their tilt angles of 18\u25e6 left and right with respect to the [210] surface direction of the HOPG substrate, the preferential adsorption of enantiomorph was observed in those chiral nano-corrals. In the nano-corrals designed for left-handed enantiomorphs, a majority of 65% exhibited a preference for adsorption, see Figure 5e. However, this preference decreased to 36% in the right-handed nano-corrals, see Figure 5f. In contrast, only 27% right-handed enantiomorphs tended to adsorb in the left-handed nano-corrals, which increased to 58% in the right-handed ones.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4176 10 of 14Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 14\nFigure 5.
