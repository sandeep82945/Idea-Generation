1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship of DBNs and BNs against T. cruzi:** 
Synthesize and evaluate a series of DBNs and BNs with different structural modifications to determine the key structural features responsible for their antitrypanosomal activity. This information could be used to design more potent and selective antitrypanosomal agents.


2. **Explore the mechanism of action of DBNs and BNs against T. cruzi:** 
Conduct detailed studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which DBNs and BNs inhibit the growth and survival of T. cruzi. This could involve investigating their interactions with tubulin and other cellular targets, as well as their effects on parasite metabolism and signaling pathways.


3. **Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of DBNs and BNs against T. cruzi:** 
Test the efficacy of DBNs and BNs in animal models of Chagas disease to determine their potential for treating the disease in vivo. This would involve assessing their ability to reduce parasite burden, improve clinical symptoms, and prevent or reverse tissue damage.


4. **Investigate the potential of DBNs and BNs for combination therapy:** 
Explore the possibility of combining DBNs and BNs with other antitrypanosomal agents to enhance their efficacy and reduce the risk of resistance development. This could involve testing different combinations of drugs in vitro and in vivo to identify synergistic or additive effects.


5. **Develop DBNs and BNs as topical or local delivery agents:** 
Formulate DBNs and BNs into topical or local delivery systems, such as gels, creams, or ointments, to target the skin or mucosal surfaces where T. cruzi can enter the body. This could be a promising approach for preventing or treating localized infections.
