    "abstractText": "The COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown have dramatically impacted families\u2019 life, raising serious concerns about children\u2019s emotional wellbeing. However, few studies have investigated whether the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological adjustment in youngest can be moderated by maternal mood and, to our knowledge, none of them has adopted a longitudinal design. The main aim of the current study was to explore if the intensity and directionality of maternal mood symptoms moderated the trajectory of emotional and behavioural problems in Italian pre-schoolers from preto during the lockdown adopting a longitudinal design. To assess maternal anxiety and depression symptoms, the EPDS and the STAI-Y were filled in by 94 and 88 women before the lockdown, when their children were 1 (Wave P1) and 3 years old (Wave P2), respectively, and by 74 women during the lockdown, when their children were 4 years old (Wave L). Mothers also filled in the CBCL/1 1\u20442\u20135 to assess their children\u2019s emotional and behavioural problems at each assessment wave. As a whole, children\u2019s emotional and behavioural problems significantly increased from preto during the lockdown. Furthermore, maternal mood moderated this trajectory. In particular, greater maternal mood symptoms were significantly associated with a greater increase in emotional reactive, anxious-depressed, withdrawn and aggressive symptoms during the lockdown. These results contribute to shed light on the role played by maternal emotional wellbeing in buffering the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on children\u2019s behavioural development. Albeit preliminary, the current findings highlight the need to provide timely psychological interventions to distressed mothers to help their children to better cope with the effects of the pandemic.",

            "text": "The outbreak of the global health emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown had a profound impact on several domains of adults and children functioning, including their psychological wellbeing. A growing number of studies show the negative effects of the ongoing pandemic on adult mental health in samples of infected patients, patients with psychiatric disorders, health care workers and non-health care workers, reporting high\nlevels of post-traumatic stress symptoms, as well as anxiety and depression symptoms in all groups (reviewed in [1]). However, less is known about mental health conditions in children [2], who have been exposed to significant changes in their daily routine linked to an extended lockdown. In particular, it is hypothesized that school closures, interruption of extra-scholastic activities, isolation from relatives and friends and exposition to increased family stress might have negatively affected children\u2019s mental health, leading to a greater risk of emotional and behavioural problems.\nBeyond the risks associated with a greater exposition to internet and social media as well as to violence [3], abuse and neglect in their homes [4, 5], preliminary evidence shows several consequences of the lockdown on children\u2019s and adolescents\u2019 psychological wellbeing, mainly in terms of anxiety and depression symptoms but also irritability, inattention, boredom and fear of COVID-19 (for a review see * Alessandra Frigerio alessandra.frigerio@lanostrafamiglia.it 1 Child Psychopathology Unit, Scientific Institute Eugenio Medea, Via Don Luigi Monza, 20, 23842\u00a0Bosisio\u00a0Parini, LC, Italy\n1 3\n[6, 7]). Emerging literature on the impact of the COVID-19 emergency in Italy, which was the first European country to be heavily affected by the pandemic, provides conflicting findings. A few works showed an increase in both internalizing [8] and externalizing [9] problems during the national lockdown, although children\u2019s pre-pandemic functioning was assessed retrospectively. In contrast, two studies failed to detect any significant differences in children\u2019s psychological wellbeing during the lockdown, as compared to the Italian reference norms [10, 11].\nFurthermore, only a handful of studies have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological functioning in preschool children, reporting increased irritability, inattention and clinging behaviour [12], sleep problems, poor appetite, agitation and separation-related anxiety [8, 13]. Importantly, some studies also showed that preschool children would be at higher risk of displaying behavioural problems in comparison to older children, who can count on better coping strategies [14, 15]. In the light of these findings, scholars have tried to identify those family proximal factors that may exacerbate or, on the contrary, attenuate the impact of the COVID-19 containment measures on psychological functioning in preschool and school age children. Insofar as parents, especially mothers, were exposed to a heightened risk of experiencing mood symptoms and stress during the lockdown [9, 16], it is likely that some of them were less able to fulfil their parental role, with probable consequences on the psychological health of their children. Indeed, a large epidemiological study [14], carried out in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, shows that mental disorders in parents were more likely to be associated with greater children\u2019s psychosocial problems during the lockdown in a sample including 12,163 children aged 2\u20135\u00a0years. However, only few studies have investigated the impact of parental mood symptoms on children\u2019s behavioural problems during the lockdown, mainly focusing on COVID-19 pandemic-related anxiety, with conflicting results. Indeed, while Zreik et\u00a0al. [17] found an association between acute COVID19 anxiety in mothers and sleep problems in their preschool age children, Crescentini et\u00a0al. [7] reported that parents who had more fear of contagion attributed lower depression and somatic symptoms to their school age children. Furthermore, while there is robust evidence that maternal depression is significantly linked to socio-emotional development in preschool years [188], as far as we know, only Glynn and colleagues [19] recently reported the negative effects of maternal depression on both internalizing and externalizing symptoms in an at-risk sample of preschool children during the COVID-19 lockdown. Last, no studies have investigated the effects of both maternal anxiety and depression on children\u2019s behavioural problems during the lockdown, taking also into account that these disorders are often comorbid. In the current study, we examined comorbid anxiety and\ndepression symptoms by distinguishing total symptom levels (i.e. symptom intensity) from whether mothers showed preponderance of anxiety vs depression symptoms (i.e. symptom directionality). Thus, in line with previous works [20, 21], we investigated overall symptom intensity as indexed by [(Anxiety + Depression)/2] and symptom directionality as indexed by [(Anxiety\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Depression)/2].\nFurthermore, despite the fact that previous investigations contributed to shed light on stress-related consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown on parents\u2019 and children\u2019s psychological wellbeing, evidence is limited by the cross-sectional design in which data related to children\u2019s pre-pandemic functioning are missing or based on retrospective reports [7]. To our knowledge, only two studies adopted a longitudinal design to investigate the impact of the lockdown on children\u2019s psychological well-being. Gassman-Pines et\u00a0al. [22] assessed daily uncooperative behaviours and worry in a sample of 2\u20137\u00a0years old American children and showed no significant changes in the frequency of these behaviours immediately before the COVID-19 outbreak and during the lockdown. Cantiani et\u00a0 al. [23] compared emotional and behavioural problems pre- and during the lockdown, in 2\u20136\u00a0years old Italian children with typical development and at high familial risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, showing an increase of anxiety, depressive and externalizing symptoms during the lockdown regardless of the family risk. However, both studies did not take into account gender-related differences in children\u2019s behavioural development. Furthermore, the short time interval between the pre-lockdown and lockdown assessment in the former study and wide heterogeneity in time interval assessment between pre- and during the lockdown (ranging from 2 to 43\u00a0months) in the latter limit possible inferences about the impact of COVID-19 containment measures on children\u2019s developmental trajectory of behavioural problems.\nThe main aim of the current study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on preschool children\u2019s psychological wellbeing in comparison to that preceding the pandemic, using specific time points, as well as to test the role played by the intensity and directionality (anxiety vs depression) of maternal mood symptoms in explaining individual differences in children\u2019s psychological adjustment. Specifically, the objectives of the study were:\na) to test if children showed an increase in emotional and behavioural problems during the lockdown compared to pre-pandemic assessments; b) to explore if the intensity and directionality of maternal mood symptoms moderated the trajectory of emotional and behavioural problems in children from pre-pandemic to during the lockdown, controlling for some potential confounders (i.e. gender, intensity and directionality of maternal mood symptoms before the pandemic). As no\n1 3\nprevious studies have employed this approach in relation to this topic, no a priori hypotheses were formulated."

Although from May 3 to June 3 some restrictions (i.e. reopening of several working activities and possibility to do individual open air sports and activities) were reduced by the Government, most of them remained, including school closures, social activities and child confinement at home. At that time, Lombardy had the 37.8% of the total cases in Italy (Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (ISS), Rome, 26 May 2020) and was characterized by a high spread of contagion within the provinces, with more than 150 cases per 100 thousand residents (Istat Report 4 June 2020).\nParticipants are part of an ongoing longitudinal study (EDI study: Effect of Depression on Infants) which aims at investigating the effects of antenatal maternal stress on several domains of child's development starting from birth [24\u201326]. For the current study, only emotional and behavioural data collected during the last two waves before the lockdown (Pre Lockdown waves, P1 and P2), when children were 12\u00a0months (mean = 13.74; SD = 1.63\u00a0months) and 3\u00a0years (mean = 3.46; SD = 0.31\u00a0years) of age, and during the lockdown (Lockdown wave, L), when children were 4\u00a0years of age (mean = 4.20; SD = 0.61\u00a0years), were taken into account. During the P1 and P2 waves, mothers were asked to fill in questionnaires concerning their depressive (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS, [27]) and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire Inventory-Y Form, STAI-Y, [28]) symptoms, as well as children\u2019s emotional and behavioural problems (Child Behavior Checklist, CBCL/1 \u00bd\u20135, [29]) during lab sessions at the IRCCS Eugenio Medea. During the L wave, mothers were invited to fill in the same questionnaires and an ad hoc form on the effects of COVID-19 through the REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at IRCCSE. Medea [30] and the ASEBA Web platform.\nAll parents gave their written informed consent to each wave of the study. The experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki (BMJ 1991; 302: 1194). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Scientific Institute E. Medea.\nDepressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed by the EPDS and the STAI-Y, that were filled in by, respectively,\n94, 88 and 74 mothers at waves P1, P2, L, while emotional and behavioural data, assessed by the CBCL/1 \u00bd\u20135, were available for 94 (Males = 50) at P1, 88 (Males = 47) at P2 and 59 (Males = 32) participants at the L wave. Participants at the L wave did not differ from those who took part only in (one or both) the pre-lockdown waves on any demographic variables (i.e. child\u2019s gender (\u03c72 (1) = 0.04; p = 0.56), maternal education (\u03c72 (1) = 1.25; p = 0.22), paternal education (\u03c72 (1) = 0.77; p = 0.26) and socioeconomic status (\u03c72 (2) = 0.69; p = 0.71), assessed by the Hollingshead (1975) classification for parental occupation [31] or maternal mood symptoms (all ps > 0.05)."

[19], Intensity of maternal mood was calculated as the average of the EPDS and STAI-S standardized scores, while Directionality was computed as half difference of the EPDS and STAI-S standardized scores, with a positive score indicating a preponderance of anxiety over depressive symptoms. Intensity and Directionality are uncorrelated and, in contrast to STAI-S and EPDS scores, can be included together in models without multicollinearity issues.\nPearson bivariate correlations and univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) were preliminarily performed to investigate potential socio-demographic and COVID-related factors (i.e. gender, parity, maternal age, parents education, socio-economic status, parents\u2019 employment, financial strains related to the pandemic, home vs office working, number of cohabiting people during the lockdown) that might influence the trajectory of children\u2019s emotional and behavioural symptoms and possibly confound the association with maternal mood during the pandemic. Furthermore, as maternal mood before the lockdown might confound the association between maternal mood during the lockdown and children\u2019s trajectory of behavioural problems, supplementary analyses were performed including directionality and intensity of maternal mood symptoms at P1 and P2 waves and are reported in Supplementary Materials.\nHierarchical Linear Models (HLMs) were employed to investigate the influence of maternal mood (i.e. intensity and directionality) on the trajectories of children\u2019s behavioural and emotional problems, while accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data (three time-points nested within individuals) [35]. HLMs were specified at two levels where subjects were level 2 and time was level 1. Before fitting explanatory models including level-2 predictors, unconditional growth models were run to examine age-related trajectories of children behavioural problems, including both linear and quadratic slopes for time. A random intercept and\na random linear slope were included to allow between-persons variability. The models were then expanded by adding between-persons explanatory variables centered around the grand mean and a cross-level interaction with this variable and the within-person predictor time. These models allow us to examine the influence of maternal mood on the agerelated trajectory of child behaviours. The model fit was tested with likelihood deviance difference tests for nested models. HLMs allow to partition different sources of variance and provide robust estimates, despite the presence of missing values, by maximizing all valid data points [36].\nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS 24 and MLWiN 3.05."

No mothers were affected by the COVID-19 virus, whereas in a few cases (N = 5) a family member was. Only 4 mothers reported the loss of a family member or a loved person. However, although this longitudinal sample is composed of participants belonging to a medium\u2013high socio-economic level, the outbreak of the pandemic has represented an economic damage for 13 (17%) of the mothers and 21 (29%) of the fathers. Only 8 mothers (10.7%) and 21 fathers (28.8%) reported working outside home during the lockdown, whereas the remaining parents were working from home (42.7% of mothers and 21.9% of fathers), on lay-off (12% of mothers and 24.7% of fathers) or not working (34.6% of mothers and 24.6% of fathers). The mean number of people cohabiting with the child during the lockdown was 3.63 (SD = 1.09).\nFurther, the COVID-19 confinement measures were perceived as having a negative impact on family routine and on the relationship with the child by 36 (48%) and 23 (31%) mothers, respectively.\nMeans and standard deviations of the CBCL/1 \u00bd\u20135 syndromes scales in each assessment wave are presented in Table\u00a02. Pairwise bivariate correlations between CBCL 1 \u00bd\u20135 scales scores and Intensity and Directionality scores of maternal mood symptoms in each assessment wave are presented in Table\u00a03.\nPreliminary ANOVA showed an effect of gender on children\u2019s emotional and behavioural problems. Specifically, males displayed significantly higher levels of Attention Problems, Aggressive Behaviors at both P2 and L waves and greater Withdrawal problems at L wave, as compared to females (ps range 0.00\u20130.04). Thus, child gender was included as covariate in the main analyses. All other sociodemographic and COVID-related factors were not significantly\n1 3\nassociated with children\u2019s emotional and behavioural problems and were discarded for subsequent analyses.\nTrajectories of\u00a0emotional and\u00a0behavioural problems from\u00a0the\u00a0pre\u2011lockdown waves to\u00a0the\u00a0lockdown wave\nUnconditional age-related trajectories are depicted in Fig.\u00a01 with dotted lines. Anxious/Depressed and Aggressive Behavior showed significant linear (respectively, estimate = \u2212 0.05, SE = 0.02, p = 0.02; estimate = \u2212 0.13, SE = 0.06, p = 0.02) and quadratic (respectively, estimate = 0.002, SE = 0.001,\np = 0.001; estimate = 0.002, SE = 0.001, p < 0.001) change over time, suggesting a curvilinear increase in those behaviours from P1 to L waves. Likewise, Attention Problems significantly changed over time in a linear (estimate = \u2212 0.13, SE = 0.06, p = 0.02) and quadratic (estimate = 0.005, SE = 0.002, p = 0.001) manner. Specifically, the instantaneous decrease in Attention Problems was followed by a slowing of this trajectory from P2 to L. Emotional Reactivity and Withdrawal showed a significant quadratic change (respectively, estimate = 0.001, SE = 0.001, p = 0.04; estimate = 0.001, SE = 0.001, p = 0.05), indicating\nWave P1 Wave P2 Wave L\n1 3\na significant curvilinear increase of these problems, whereas Sleep Problems significantly changed over time showing a linear decrease (estimate = \u2212 0.06, SE = 0.03, p = 0.02, quadratic slope not significant p = 0.27) from P1 to L waves. Last, Somatic Complaints did not significantly change over time (both linear and quadratic slopes ps > 0.69). All unconditional growth models were adjusted for child\u2019s gender.\nExposure to\u00a0maternal mood and\u00a0children\u2019s trajectories of\u00a0emotional and\u00a0behavioural problems\nConditional growth models for the effects of intensity of maternal mood on children\u2019s trajectory of emotional and behavioural problems are reported in Table\u00a04. As shown in Fig.\u00a01, the intensity of maternal mood was significantly associated with the linear and quadratic change in Emotional Reactive and Anxious/Depressed over time, while adjusting for child\u2019s gender. Specifically, simple slope analysis indicated a curvilinear growth in these problems from P1 to L waves (for both linear and quadratic slopes ps < 0.01) in children of more anxious/depressed mothers. In contrast, the linear and quadratic slopes were not significant in children of less anxious/depressed mothers, indicating no significant changes over time in these problems (ps > 0.31). For all these scales, the inclusion of intensity of maternal mood resulted in a significant improvement of the model fit over the unconditional growth models (respectively, for Emotional Reactive deviance difference (3) = 245.99, p < 0.001, for Anxious/Depressed deviance difference (3) = 240.59, p < 0.001). Intensity of maternal mood was also significantly associated with the quadratic slope of children\u2019s trajectory of Withdrawn and Aggressive Behavior, while adjusting for child\u2019s gender (for Withdrawn deviance difference (3) = 213.25, p < 0.001, for Aggressive Behavior deviance difference (3) = 323.43, p < 0.001). In particular, a greater increase in Withdrawn or Aggressive Behavior was observed in children of more anxious/depressed mothers\n(p < 0.001), while no significant change in children of less anxious/depressed mothers (p > 0.70) emerged. In contrast, intensity of maternal mood was not significantly associated with children changes in\u00a0Somatic Complaints, Sleep and Attention Problems over time, while adjusting for child\u2019s gender (ps > 0.05).\nLast, directionality of maternal mood was not significantly associated with children\u2019s change in emotional and behavioural problems over time (ps > 0.05), while controlling for child\u2019s gender.\nControlling for intensity and directionality of maternal mood at 1 and 3\u00a0years of age did not substantially change the direction and significance of the results (see Supplementary Table\u00a0S4)."

Our data extend previous findings from cross-sectional studies conducted in Italy and abroad in both preschool [12, 18] and school age children [8, 12] by including a longitudinal assessment of maternal and children\u2019s wellbeing before\nCBCL/1 \u00bd\u20135 P1 P2 L\nIntensity Directionality Intensity Directionality Intensity Directionality\nEmotionally reactive 0.34** \u2212 0.002 0.19 \u2212 0.24* 0.49** 0.05\n1 3\nTa bl\ne 4\nF ul\nl p re\ndi ct\nio n\nm od\nel s f\nor th\ne eff\nec ts\no f i\nnt en\nsi ty\na nd\nd ire\nct io\nna lit\ny of\nm at\ner na\nl m oo\nd on\nc hi\nld re\nn\u2019 s t\nra je\nct or\nie s o\nf e m\not io\nna l a\nnd b\neh av\nio ur\nal p\nro bl\nem s f\nro m\np re\n- t o\ndu rin\ng th\ne lo\nck do\nw n\nEm ot\nio na\nlly re\nac tiv\ne A\nnx io\nus d\nep re\nss ed\nSo m\nat ic\nc om\npl ai\nnt s\nW ith\ndr aw\nn Sl\nee p\npr ob\nle m\ns A\ntte nt\nio n\npr ob\nle m\ns A\ngg re\nss iv\ne be\nha vi\nor s\nEs tim\nat e\n(S E)\np Es\ntim at e (S\nE) p\nEs tim\nat e\n(S E)\np Es\ntim at e (S\nE) p\nEs tim\nat e\n(S E)\np Es\ntim at e (S\nE) p\nEs tim\nat e\n(S E)\np\nFi xe\nd eff\nec ts\nIn te\nrc ep\nt 1.\n66 (0\n.2 0)\n< 0.\n00 1\n1. 83\n(0 .2\n1) <\n0. 00\n1 1.\n20 (0\n.1 8)\n< 0.\n00 1\n0. 75\n(0 .1\n3) <\n0. 00\n1 3.\n37 (0\n.3 3)\n< 0.\n00 1\n3. 39\n(0 .2\n5) <\n0. 00\n1 8.\n5 (0\n.5 8)\n< 0.\n00 1\nG en\nde r\n\u2212 0\n.0 7\n(0 .2\n6) 0.\n79 \u2212\n0 .4\n1 (0\n.2 6)\n0. 12\n\u2212 0\n.2 0\n(0 .2\n2) 0.\n38 \u2212\n0 .1\n2 (0\n.1 7)\n0. 49\n0. 16\n(0 .4\n4) 0.\n71 \u2212\n1 .0\n7 (0\n.3 3)\n0. 00\n1 \u2212\n2 .2\n6 (0\n.8 5)\n0. 01\nIn te\nns ity\n0. 18\n(0 .1\n7) 0.\n30 0.\n29 (0\n.1 9)\n0. 14\n0. 37\n(0 .1\n6) 0.\n02 0.\n16 (0\n.1 1)\n0. 15\n0. 92\n(0 .3\n0) 0.\n00 2\n0. 46\n(0 .2\n2) 0.\n04 0.\n36 (0\n.4 9)\n0. 46\nD ire\nct io\nna lit\ny 0.\n51 (0\n.4 8)\n0. 28\n0. 53\n(0 .5\n3) 0.\n32 0.\n52 (0\n.4 5)\n0. 25\n0. 18\n(0 .3\n1) 0.\n56 1.\n26 (0\n.8 2)\n0. 12\n\u2212 0\n.3 1\n(0 .6\n0) 0.\n61 \u2212\n0 .8\n8 (1\n.3 4)\n0. 51\nLi ne\nar \u2212\n0 .0\n3 (0\n.0 2)\n0. 23\n\u2212 0\n.0 6\n(0 .0\n2) 0.\n01 \u2212\n0 .0\n1 (0\n.0 2)\n0. 69\n\u2212 0\n.0 03\n(0 .0\n2) 0.\n86 \u2212\n0 .0\n7 (0\n.0 3)\n0. 02\n\u2212 0\n.0 6\n(0 .0\n2) 0.\n00 3\n\u2212 0\n.1 8\n(0 .0\n5) 0.\n00 1\n\u00a0\u00a0I nt\nen si\nty \u2212\n0 .0\n6 (0\n.0 2)\n0. 01\n\u2212 0\n.0 6\n(0 .0\n2) 0.\n01 \u2212\n0 .0\n2 (0\n.0 2)\n0. 22\n\u2212 0\n.0 3\n(0 .0\n2) 0.\n11 0.\n01 (0\n.0 3)\n0. 75\n\u2212 0\n.0 05\n(0 .0\n2) 0.\n84 \u2212\n0 .1\n1 (0\n.0 6)\n0. 06\n\u00a0\u00a0D ire\nct io nal ity \u2212\n0 .0\n6 (0\n.0 6)\n0. 32\n\u2212 0\n.0 3\n(0 .0\n7) 0.\n60 \u2212\n0 .0\n5 (0\n.0 5)\n0. 38\n\u2212 0\n.0 4\n(0 .0\n5) 0.\n43 \u2212\n0 .0\n6 (0\n.0 8)\n0. 45\n\u2212 0\n.0 01\n(0 .0\n6) 0.\n99 \u2212\n0 .1\n1 (0\n.1 5)\n0. 50\nQ ua\ndr at\nic 0.\n00 1\n(0 .0\n01 )\n0. 02\n0. 00\n3 (0\n.0 01\n) <\n0. 00\n1 0.\n00 0\n(0 .0\n01 )\n0. 66\n0. 00\n1 (0\n.0 00\n) 0.\n04 0.\n00 1\n(0 .0\n01 )\n0. 22\n0. 00\n2 (0\n.0 01\n) 0.\n01 0.\n01 (0\n.0 02\n) <\n0. 00 1 \u00a0\u00a0I nt en si ty 0. 00 2 (0 .0 01 ) 0. 00 1 0. 00 2 (0 .0 01 ) < 0. 00 1 0. 00 1 (0 .0 01 ) 0. 19 0. 00 1 (0 .0 01 ) 0. 01 \u2212 0 .0 01 (0 .0 01 ) 0. 51 0. 00 0 (0 .0 01 ) 0. 89 0. 00 4 (0 .0 02 ) 0. 01 \u00a0\u00a0D ire ct io nal ity 0. 00 2 (0 .0 02 ) 0. 30 0. 00 1 (0 .0 02 ) 0. 50 0. 00 1 (0 .0 02 ) 0. 43 0. 00 2 (0 .0 01 ) 0. 20 0. 00 0 (0 .0 02 ) 0. 83 0. 00 1 (0 .0 02 ) 0. 70 0. 00 2 (0 .0 04 ) 0. 62\nRa nd\nom e\nffe ct s Le ve l 2 (i nd iv id\nua l)\n\u00a0In te\nrc ep t va ria nc\ne 0.\n58 (0\n.3 7)\n0. 12\n0. 92\n(0 .4\n5) 0.\n04 0.\n77 (0\n.3 2)\n0. 01\n0. 00\n(0 .0\n0) 0.\n99 3.\n48 (0\n.9 7)\n< 0.\n00 1\n1. 76\n(0 .5\n3) 0.\n00 1\n7. 04\n(2 .7\n2) 0.\n01\n\u00a0L in\nea r s\nlo pe\nva\nria nc\ne 0.\n00 1\n(0 .0\n01 )\n0. 13\n0. 00\n2 (0\n.0 01\n) 0.\n04 0.\n00 1\n(0 .0\n00 )\n0. 08\n0. 00\n1 (0\n.0 0)\n0. 00\n1 0.\n00 2\n(0 .0\n01 )\n0. 06\n0. 00\n1 (0\n.0 01\n) 0.\n15 0.\n00 4\n(0 .0\n03 )\n0. 31\n\u00a0In te\nrc ep t/ lin ea r sl op e co va rian ce\n\u2212 0\n.0 07\n(0 .0\n1) 0.\n57 \u2212\n0 .0\n2 (0\n.0 2)\n0. 13\n\u2212 0\n.0 2\n(0 .0\n1) 0.\n12 0.\n00 (0\n.0 0)\n0. 99\n\u2212 0\n.0 5\n(0 .0\n3) 0.\n06 \u2212\n0 .0\n2 (0\n.0 1)\n0. 15\n0. 02\n7 (0\n.0 75\n) 0.\n72\nLe ve\nl 1 (o\ncc as\nio ns ) \u00a0In te rc ep t va ria nc e\n1. 27\n(0 .2\n4) <\n0. 00\n1 1.\n38 (0\n.2 6)\n< 0.\n00 1\n0. 90\n(0 .1\n7) <\n0. 00\n1 0.\n77 (0\n.1 0)\n< 0.\n00 1\n1. 97\n(0 .3\n7) <\n0. 00\n1 1.\n19 (0\n.2 2)\n< 0.\n00 1\n7. 47\n(1 .4\n2) <\n0. 00\n1\n1 3\nand during the lockdown, thus making more reasonable to attribute the worsening of symptoms to the containment measures. It is also important to note that our study counts on the adoption of two different time points of assessment before the lockdown, which makes the analyses of emotional and behavioural problems trajectory methodologically much more robust. Our results are partly in line with those of Cantiani et\u00a0al. [22], who found an increase of anxious-depressive and aggressive symptoms in their longitudinal sample of preschool children from pre- to during the lockdown. Similarly, we also found no impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on somatic complaints, sleep and attention problems in our sample, in contrast to results emerging from previous crosssectional studies [12, 37]. Conversely, we found an intensification of emotional reactive and withdrawn symptoms during the lockdown, thus extending the negative effects of the containment measures to other internalizing syndromes. It is likely that these inconsistencies may be explained by methodological differences related to a more heterogeneous age group, a wide time interval of assessment from pre- to during the lockdown and a different statistical approach in Cantiani et\u00a0al. study [22]. Taken together, existing data converge to indicate that the COVID-19 lockdown negatively impacted children\u2019s psychological well-being, leading to an increase in emotional and behavioural symptoms. We might speculate that children\u2019s lack of daily routine, due to prolonged school closures during the lockdown, including a decrease in physical activity and outdoor time, the lack of face-to-face interaction with peers, the increase in screen exposure as well as irregular sleep rhythm [38], might have negatively impacted the children\u2019s mental health. However, this hypothesis needs to be specifically addressed in future studies.\nMore interestingly, our study is among the first to show that the intensity of maternal mood symptoms plays a significant role in determining individual differences in child\u2019s emotional and behavioural adjustment from pre- to during the lockdown, independently from the direction (anxiety versus depressive symptoms) of such distress. Particularly, we found that greater maternal mood symptoms were significantly associated with a greater increase in internalizing (i.e. emotional reactive, anxious/depressed, withdrawn) and externalizing (i.e. aggressive) problems in our sample of preschool children during the lockdown. Importantly, the observed associations were found while adjusting for child\u2019s gender and remained significant when controlling for the intensity of maternal mood symptoms in the pre-pandemic waves. These findings extend existing evidence on the role of maternal mental health on children\u2019s psychological adjustment [39] by showing that maternal psychological distress might be particularly detrimental for children\u2019s emotional well-being under stressful circumstances, such as those constituted by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent\nlockdown. This is in line with a \u201ccumulative stress\u201d hypothesis [40] and suggests that the preschoolers\u2019 risk to experience emotional and behavioural problems increases as adversity (i.e. lockdown experience and maternal distress) accumulates.\nOn the contrary, children whose mothers experimented lower levels of mental distress during the lockdown showed no increase in internalizing and externalizing problems from pre- to during the lockdown, thus showing the protective role of maternal mental wellbeing against the effects of the pandemic restrictions on children\u2019s emotional and behavioural adjustment.\nInsofar as mothers\u2019 and children\u2019s mental health is intrinsically intertwined, different interrelated pathways might explain the observed associations during the lockdown. It can be speculated that mothers who suffered significant mood symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown might also have experienced more difficulties in dealing with increased caregiving responsibilities linked to the stay-at-home order. This might have triggered a significant parenting-related exhaustion [15], with consequences on mother\u2013child relationship, which, in turn, might have impacted on the emotional and behavioural adjustment of their children. Likewise, it can also be suggested that the closure of regulated childcare services, due to the lockdown restrictions, might have contributed to exacerbate the impact of maternal psychological wellbeing on children\u2019s emotional and behavioural problems, especially the internalizing ones. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies showing that regulated childcare services may have a significant role in buffering the negative effects of maternal depression on internalizing problems in the offspring [41]. Last, as the moderating role of the intensity of maternal distress was evident for almost all internalizing behaviors, investigated through the CBCL/1 \u00bd\u20135, the weight of shared mother\u2013child genetic vulnerability for internalizing symptoms needs to be considered as another possible underlying mechanism.\nIt is noteworthy that we did not report any significant association between directionality of maternal distress (anxiety versus depressive symptoms) and the trajectory of behavioural problems in preschoolers. This null finding might suggest that maternal depression and anxiety represent a broad risk phenotype for children development, although replication of this finding in clinical samples of depressed and anxious women is needed.\nThis study should be looked at with some limitations in mind. First, our findings are based on a relatively small lowrisk sample of mother\u2013child dyads, thus soliciting the need of replications with larger and clinical samples. Second, both maternal mood symptoms and children\u2019s emotional and behavioural problems were assessed through self-report questionnaires filled in by the mothers, making difficult to exclude possible rater-related bias. Third, the observational\n1 3\ndesign of our study does not allow to infer any causality of the association between maternal and children\u2019s wellbeing. Last, we only focused on maternal mood symptoms in moderating the trajectory of emotional and behavioural problems from pre- to during the lockdown, without investigating paternal mental wellbeing, which is likely to exert a significant impact on children adjustment [42]. Similarly, we did not take into account the possible moderating role of family social support that remains an open area of inquiry for future research.\nDespite these limitations, our study is among the first to evaluate the moderating role of maternal mood on emotional and behavioural problems in young children during the first wave of the COVID-19 in our country, taking also into account both maternal and children functioning before the lockdown. Our findings suggest that maternal emotional well-being in times of emergency might mitigate the adverse impact of the restrictive measures on children\u2019s psychological adjustment, thus promoting children\u2019s resilience in the face of the pandemic. We are currently re-assessing maternal and children\u2019s well-being during the second wave of the COVID-19 in our country, to better understand the acute and persisting effects of the pandemic on preschool children wellbeing.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00787- 021- 01925-0.\nAcknowledgements This study was funded by 5 \u00d7 1000 Funds for biomedical research.
