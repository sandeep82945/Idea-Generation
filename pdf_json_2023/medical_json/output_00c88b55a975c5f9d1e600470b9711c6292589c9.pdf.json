In certain animals, such as hamsters, plasma melatonin concentrations have 8 been correlated with aggressive behavior. However, whether this relationship applies to horses remains 9 unclear. To address this research gap, this study aimed to evaluate differences in the plasma melatonin 10 concentrations among horses of different breeds, ages, and sexes and examine the correlation between 11 plasma melatonin concentrations and the temperament of the horses, including docility, affinity, 12 dominance, and trainability. Blood samples from 32 horses were collected from the Horse Industry 13 Complex Center of Jeonju Kijeon College. The docility, affinity, dominance, and trainability of the 14 horses were assessed by three professional trainers who were well-acquainted with the horses. Plasma 15 melatonin concentrations were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The 16 consequent values were compared between the horses of different breeds, ages, and sexes using a three-17 way analysis of variance and least significant difference post hoc test. Linear regression analysis was 18 employed to identify the relationship between plasma melatonin concentrations and docility, affinity, 19 dominance, and trainability. The results showed that the plasma melatonin concentrations significantly 20 differed with breeds in Thoroughbred and cold-blooded horses. However, there were no differences in 21 the plasma melatonin concentrations between the horse ages and sexes. Furthermore, plasma melatonin 22 concentrations did not exhibit a significant correlation with the ranking of docility, affinity, dominance, 23 and trainability. 24\n25\nKeywords 26\nMelatonin, behavioral temperament, horse 27\n28\nAC CE\nPT ED\nIntroduction 29\nTemperament refers to individual differences in biological behavioral characteristics based on 30 the behavior and exhibits various behavioral characteristics (1). The temperament of animals is one of 31 the key factors affecting the degree of interrelationship with humans (2). Thus, predicting the 32 temperament of animals may prevent accidents during activities involving large animals, such as horses 33 (3). Visser and coworkers (4) indicated that knowing a horse\u2019s temperaments is essential for safe riding 34 or non-riding activities. Furthermore, knowing the temperament of horses improves their welfare by 35 ensuring appropriate management. Kilgour (5) noted that animal\u2019s temperament could be determed 36 based on the evaluation of animal behavior. However, because such behavior evaluation can often be 37 subjective, objective, and practical assessment methods for the temperament of horses are warranted. 38 Neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers between neurons and target receptors mediate all 39 neuronal phenomena (6). Neurotransmitters influence various social behavior in animals, including 40 affinity and depression (7). For example, to alleviate the symptoms of behavioral disorders, such as 41 those of depression and anxiety, serotonin is released into the synapse (8-10). Oxytocin is a neuropeptide 42 that alleviates the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and repetitive behavior in mice (11) (12). In horses, 43 serotonin and oxytocin act as a factor to determine equine docility and friendliness to humans (13). 44 Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal glands in the diencephalon, produced by 45 sunlight exposure during the day and released at night. Kilic and coworkers (14) reported that melatonin 46 secretion was associated with various social behaviors, including hyperactivity, anxiety, and depression 47 One study relating melatonin concentrations to behavior reported that animals exhibiting hyperactivity 48 demonstrated a shorter duration of melatonin signaling and frequent nocturnal melatonin peaks 49 compared with the control group (15). Remarkably, melatonin has been related to aggressive behavior 50 in animals. In male Syrian hamsters, animals exhibiting higher melatonin concentrations demonstrated 51 more aggressive behavior (16). In rats, melatonin exhibited neuroprotective action and improved 52 insomnia-induced anxiety (17, 18). Furthermore, in a study involving humans, the participants who 53 were administered melatonin exhibited more aggression in specific situations than participants in the 54 control group who were administered a placebo (19). Hence, these results indicate the association of 55\nAC CE\nPT ED\nmelatonin with aggressive behavior in nonhuman mammals as well as humans. However, the 56 relationship between melatonin and the temperaments of horses is yet to be elucidated. 57 Neurotransmitter secretions differ depending on the breed, age, and sex of animals. For 58 example, the behavior of domestic dogs differs depending on their breed (20). Sex in rats and age in 59 monkeys have been associated with differences in their neurotransmitter systems (21, 22). Thus, 60 differences in melatonin concentration according to breed, age, and sex in horses are worth examining. 61 This study aimed to evaluate differences in the plasma concentration of melatonin among the 62 different breeds, ages, and sexes of horses and to examine the correlation between plasma 63 concentrations and the temperament of horses, including docility, affinity, dominance, and trainability. 64 65\nAC CE\nPT ED"

            "text": "Docility, affinity, dominance, and trainability were scored by three professional trainers who 93 had been training the horses for at least five years and were well-acquainted with the horses. The 94 temperament of each horse was assessed based on the criteria shown in Table 1. Docility was scored 95 based on the behavioral response of the horses in an unfamiliar situation and the time required to catch 96 the horse. Affinity was evaluated according to the distance the horses maintained from humans and their 97 response to humans. Trainability was determined as per the willingness of the horses to participate in 98 training and the time required to achieve the training goal. The dominance of a horse was assessed by 99 it gaining the upper hand among other horses in social settings or when competing over food. The 100 temperament of each horse was determined by averaging the scores given by the three professional 101 trainers. The scores for each aspect of the behavioral temperament of the horses ranged from 0 to 5 102\npoints. The scores were categorized into three grades: low (0-1 point), medium (2-3 points), and high 103\n(4-5 points). 104\n105 Statistical analysis 106 All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS V25 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). A three-107 way analysis of variance with the least significant difference post hoc test was used to compare plasma 108 melatonin concentrations among the horses of different breeds, ages, and sex. Linear regression was 109 employed to characterize the relationship between plasma melatonin concentrations and docility, 110 affinity, dominance, and trainability rankings. To increase normality and accuracy, all raw data were 111 converted to log values. Raw data exceeding the first and third quartiles were considered outliers and 112 removed. 113\n114\nAC CE\nPT ED\nResult 115\nMelatonin concentration among breeds, ages, and sexes in horses 116 Differences in breeds, ages, and sexes according to plasma concentration of melatonin were 117 analyzed. The melatonin concentrations between cold-blooded horses and Thoroughbreds were 118 significantly different (Table 2). The mean concentration of melatonin in cold-blooded horses was 119 significantly lower than in Thoroughbreds. Conversely, the mean melatonin concentrations in 120 Warmbloods did not significantly differ from that of other breeds. Furthermore, plasma melatonin 121 concentrations did not vary with age (Table 3) or between geldings and mares (Table 4). The mean 122 melatonin concentration demonstrated a significant interaction with the horse breeds (P < 0.05); 123 however, melatonin concentrations did not differ significantly with the age and sex of the horses. 124 125 Differences in the plasma concentration of melatonin according to horse use 126 The differences in the plasma concentration of melatonin according to the uses of horses were 127 confirmed. Given that cold-blooded horses exhibited significantly lower plasma melatonin 128 concentrations than the other horse breeds, their data were excluded from the horse use analysis. Horses 129 in the training program (who were being trained) exhibited the highest mean melatonin concentration; 130 however, the difference was not statistically significant. 131 132 Relation between melatonin concentrations with docility 133 The graph of linear regression showed the relation between the plasma concentration of 134 melatonin and the ranking of docility. Melatonin concentration showed a coefficient (R2) of 0.01 (P = 135 0.90, Figure 1). There was no correlation between the plasma concentration of melatonin and the 136 ranking of the docility of horses. 137 138 Relation between melatonin concentrations with an affinity 139 The graph of linear regression showed the relation between the plasma concentration of 140 melatonin and the ranking of affinity. The linear regression of plasma melatonin concentrations and 141\nAC CE\nPT ED\naffinity had a coefficient (R2) of 0.01 (P = 0.90, Figure 2), indicating no significant relationship. 142 143 Relation between melatonin concentrations with trainability 144 The graph of linear regression showed the relation between melatonin concentration and 145 trainability. The linear regression of plasma melatonin concentrations and trainability had a coefficient 146 (R2) of 0.01 (P = 0.90, Figure 3), indicating no significant relationship. 147 148 Relation between melatonin concentrations with dominance 149 The graph of linear regression showed the relation between the plasma concentration of 150 melatonin and the ranking of dominance. The linear regression of plasma melatonin concentrations and 151 dominance had a coefficient (R2) of 0.08 (P = 0.623, Figure 4), indicating no correlation. 152\n153\nAC CE\nPT ED\nDiscussion 154\nThe variation of melatonin concentration in the different breeds, ages, and sexes 155 In this study, the variations of melatonin concentration in the different breeds, ages, and sexes 156 were evaluated. Plasma melatonin concentrations were significantly lower in cold-blooded horses than 157 in Thoroughbreds, suggesting varying melatonin concentrations between these breeds (Table 2). Horses 158 are known to differ in personality according to their breeds (23). For example, Thoroughbreds were 159 specifically bred for horse racing (24), whereas cold-blooded horses have been employed as workhorses 160 for a long time, adapted from natural conditions (25). Furthermore, the personality of horses may differ 161 with the degree of their domestication and training status (26). Therefore, horse breeds may exhibit 162 different average melatonin concentrations owing to different breeds and training. Thoroughbreds are 163 considered hot-blooded horses and thus may differ from cold-blooded horses; hot-blooded horses 164 exhibit an active and sensitive personality, while cold-blooded horses exhibit a mild personality (27). 165 These observations suggest that horses exhibiting higher melatonin concentrations demonstrate a more 166 active personality. However, Thoroughbreds were the only hot-blooded horses included in this study. 167 To further confirm differences in plasma melatonin concentrations between hot-blooded and cold-168 blooded horses, other hot-blooded horse breeds should be analyzed. 169 The plasma melatonin concentrations of Warmbloods also tended to be higher than that of 170 cold-blooded horses, although the difference was not statistically significant. Warmblood horses exhibit 171 large individual variations in plasma melatonin concentrations, probably owing to different training 172 methods, i.e., some Warmblood horses were trained for dressage and others for show jumping. This 173 could be a reason for the variation in the plasma concentration of melatonin within the Warmblood 174 horses. In this study, these two groups were combined as Warmblood horses owing to the small 175 population. Thus, future studies should compare plasma melatonin concentrations between the two 176 groups of Warmblood horses. 177 Variations in plasma melatonin concentrations according to age and sex were also evaluated. 178 Cold-blooded horses were excluded from this analysis because of the association of this breed with 179 plasma melatonin concentrations. There was no difference in plasma melatonin concentrations 180\nAC CE\nPT ED\naccording to age (approximately 1\u20135 years, 6\u201312 years, >13 years; Tables 3), suggesting that melatonin 181 concentrations were unrelated to age. This result was in accordance with that of a previous study 182 reporting that melatonin concentrations in humans were unrelated to age, showing similar melatonin 183 concentrations in healthy older (aged 65\u201381 years) and young (aged 18\u201330 years) individuals (28). 184 These results support our finding that the plasma concentration of melatonin in horses is not associated 185 with age. In this study, there was no difference in melatonin concentration between geldings and mares. 186 Furthermore, no difference in melatonin concentrations was detected between geldings and mares, 187 indicating that melatonin concentrations in horses were sex hormone-independent. This result is 188 consistent with that of a previous study reporting no difference in melatonin secretion rates between 189 men and women (29). 190 In the present study, a correlation was observed between plasma melatonin concentrations and 191 horse use (Table 5). The horses included in this study were chiefly used for horse competitions and 192 riding lessons, whereas some were being trained. As most of the young horses were cold-blooded, they 193 were excluded from the analysis of horse uses. Horses in the training program tended to exhibit higher 194 melatonin concentrations than the other horses. Notably, the horses used in competitions and for riding 195 lessons were extensively trained for safe riding contrary to the horses in the training program. Compared 196 with well-trained horses, partly trained horses tended to exhibit more aggressive behavior owing to their 197 inexperience with humans. This finding is consistent with that of a previous study showing that 198 melatonin concentrations affected aggressive behavior in rodent and fish models (30). 199 200 The relation between melatonin and temperaments of horses 201 Docility is defined as the gentleness of personality or mind. To ensure safe riding and 202 interactions, using horses exhibiting high docility is essential. Horses demonstrating low docility may 203 engender hyperactivity and related problems, such as impulsiveness, inability to concentrate, and being 204 easily distracted. In this study, plasma melatonin concentrations were not correlated with docility 205 ranking, suggesting that melatonin is not associated with this aspect of temperament in horses. This 206 result is in accordance with those reported previously. In humans, hyperactivity and plasma melatonin 207\nAC CE\nPT ED\nconcentrations were not correlated (31). In addition, melatonin treatment did not reduce the symptoms 208 of patients with hyperactivity (32). These results suggest that melatonin is not involved in controlling 209 docility in horses. Similarly, there was no correlation between plasma melatonin concentrations and 210 affinity in horses. Among horses, affinity is assessed based on friendliness to other horses and humans. 211 Horses with high affinity tend to have good relationships with their herd (33). Furthermore, affinity has 212 been linked to social skills. Both animals and humans with low affinity may lack social skills, causing 213 behavioral disorders, including depression and anxiety (34). 214 Diminished social skills can also produce various pathological changes in the brain, thereby 215 leading to behavioral changes (35). Depression, caused by the lack of monoamines, is frequently treated 216 with serotonin, a melatonin precursor. Serotonin increases the levels of neuromodulators and growth 217 factors by activating cell signaling pathways, eventually restoring monoamine synapses(36, 37). 218 However, Waterman and coworkers (38) reported that the levels of 6-hydroxy melatonin sulfate, a 219 melatonin metabolite, did not differ between people with depressive disorders and healthy controls, 220 suggesting that melatonin is not related to depressive behaviors. Thus, the findings of these previous 221 studies support our finding that melatonin is not associated with affinity in horses. 222 Dominant animals typically take the lead position during sexual and feeding activities. 223 Previous studies have reported melatonin increases the propensity to aggression in animals and humans. 224 For example, in female Siberian hamsters, melatonin induces aggressive behavior by regulating adrenal 225 androgens (39). In humans, high melatonin concentrations encourage aggressive behaviors, such as 226 irritability and anger (19). Exogenous melatonin administration has also been demonstrated to increase 227 aggression in animals and humans. However, we found no relationship between plasma melatonin 228 concentrations and dominant and aggressive behaviors in horses. Notably, in this study, the relationship 229 between endogenous melatonin instead of exogenous melatonin with aggression was analyzed. Based 230 on the results of these studies, we hypothesized that short-term aggressive behavior can be elicited in 231 response to exogenous melatonin administration. However, endogenous melatonin concentrations 232 cannot be used as an indicator of the degree of aggression. 233 Trainability refers to the ability to learn and quickly accept training. Trainability varies with 234\nAC CE\nPT ED\nindividual abilities, such as learning and memory. Several lines of evidence suggest a relationship 235 between melatonin and learning. For example, melatonin has been shown to improve symptoms of 236 neurodegenerative disorders, reducing neurooxidative stress as well as learning and memory deficits 237 (40-42). Melatonin also facilitates short-term memory (43). However, the result of this study showed 238 no correlation between the plasma concentration and the ranking of trainability of horses. Notably, 239 Martini and coworkers (44) found that melatonin promotes the disappearance of learned responses and 240 demonstrates no effect on memory acquisition. Different results of these two studies could be due to the 241 variation in observation time, interval, or stress levels. Thus, it is not clear that melatonin is associated 242 with the training ability of other species. However, the present study suggests that the plasma 243 concentration of melatonin cannot be used as a marker to evaluate the trainability of horses. 244 In conclusion, the average plasma melatonin concentrations differed according to the horse 245 breeds. However, melatonin was not associated with docility, affinity, dominance, or trainability of the 246 horses and is thus unlikely to be a useful biomarker for horse temperaments. 247 248\nAcknowledgement 249\nThe authors would like to thanks Yeonju Choi, Youngwook Jung, and Shakeel Hafiz 250 Muhammad (Kyungpook National University, Republic of Korea). 251 252\nAC CE\nPT ED\nReferences 253\n1.
