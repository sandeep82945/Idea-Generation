"The key factors affecting the preparation of nanocrystals and the content of targeted drug delivery need to be further studied. Compared with nanocrystals, nanocarriers can achieve targeted release and protect drugs from early release before reaching the endpoint. But there are also some shortcomings. In the preparation process, the research and development of nanocarrier technology requirements are high, and the preparation process is complex. The process is greatly affected by equipment, operating conditions, raw materials and process parameters. The subtle changes in the manufacturing process can cause large changes in the final product quality, resulting in high uncertainty and poor reproducibility in production. The tissue specificity of the targeted drug is not high, and most experiments are conducted in vitro, and intracorporeal environment is not easy to be detected. So the development of core technology of nano medicine needs to be further broken."
