Development of Advanced Cooperative and Collaborative Systems for Off-Road Environments: Exploring the design, implementation, and efficacy of cooperative and collaborative AV systems specifically tailored for challenging off-road environments, such as mines, agricultural fields, and forests. This research could focus on creating robust communication protocols, sensor fusion techniques, and decision-making algorithms that enhance the efficiency and safety of AVs operating in these conditions.

Human-AV Interaction Models in Mixed Traffic Conditions: Investigating new models of interaction between humans (both as drivers and pedestrians) and AVs in mixed traffic environments. This research could aim to understand and improve the safety, efficiency, and public acceptance of AVs by focusing on intuitive communication methods, predictive behavior modeling, and the integration of human factors into AV decision-making processes.

Security and Safety Assurance across Different Levels of Automation: Developing comprehensive frameworks and methodologies for ensuring the security and safety of AVs across different levels of automation and operational design domains (ODDs). This could include creating advanced simulation and testing environments, enhancing cybersecurity measures for AV communication systems, and developing standards for minimal risk conditions and maneuvers in various automation scenarios.

Eco-friendly and Sustainable Automated Vehicle Operations: Focusing on the development of AV technologies and operational strategies that prioritize environmental sustainability. This research could explore optimization algorithms for route planning, vehicle platooning, and fleet management that reduce emissions, improve fuel efficiency, and integrate AVs into wider smart city and eco-friendly transportation initiatives.

Scalable Architectures for Collaborative and Cooperative AVs: Designing scalable and flexible architectures that support the dynamic and efficient operation of collaborative and cooperative AVs in various applications. This could involve the development of novel communication and coordination mechanisms that allow for real-time information sharing and decision-making among AVs, the integration of AI and machine learning for adaptive behavior, and the exploration of decentralized versus centralized control paradigms for different use cases.
