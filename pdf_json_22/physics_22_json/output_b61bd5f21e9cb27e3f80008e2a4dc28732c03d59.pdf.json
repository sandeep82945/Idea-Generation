            "text": "For as long as the nature of the cosmological constant \u039b remains a mystery [7, 23, 27, 28, 30, 38] one can turn things around and try to explain related issues first, in a search for possible hints to understand the underlying physics fully at a later step. In this spirit, the implications of a positive cosmological constant have been analysed in ref. [1].\nVery reasonably, a complete understanding of the nature of the cosmological constant requires a consistent framework embracing together a quantum mechanical description and the gravitational interaction. From this point of view, new paradigms have been recently proposed where quantum mechanics is emergent and gravity appears as a classical, emergent interaction [12, 13, 14, 31]. Gravity is classical in such frameworks, as in refs. [20, 33]. All these proposals are of such a radical nature that one expects, once understood, they will offer powerful insights into deep current open questions in cosmology. In this context of classical gravity paradigms, the problem about the nature and properties of the cosmological constant arises as a natural question to be considered. In particular, in this paper we are concerned with the consequences that the entropic point of view of gravity has on the cosmological constant.\nEntropic notions play a central role in novel approaches to key problems in theoretical physics [9, 11]. In refs. [25, 26], a nonzero value of the cosmological constant has been argued to render finite the amount of cosmic information accessible to an eternal observer. An explicit proposal concerning the possible nature of the atoms of spacetime has been put forward in ref. [32]. The entropic approach to gravity pioneered in refs. [33, 34], as well as the holographic bound, have been exploited in refs. [6, 8, 10, 19]. Altogether we see that a lot of useful information can be extracted via this indirect\napproach, where one tries to probe the fabric of the cosmos by means of simpler, or possibly better known, physical systems.\nOne such simplification is provided by the Newtonian limit [2, 3, 15, 17, 35, 36, 37], as opposed to the fully relativisitic regime. Further advantage is provided by the duality between the Newtonian cosmological fluid on the one hand, and the probability fluid of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, on the other. This duality has been first exhibited in our papers [6, 10]. It provides an equivalent, but more manageable description of the cosmological fluid, because it uses the well\u2013known operator formalism of nonrelativistic quantum theory even if the system under discussion is classical instead of quantum. Although no conceptual simplification is afforded by this duality, the formalism of quantum operators renders the approach computationally straightforward. At the end of the day, one simply ignores the quantum operators used at intermediate steps of the calculations and replaces them with their expectation values in suitably selected quantum states. If the latter enjoy semiclassical properties, then the use of quantum theory for obtaining a classical result is justified a posteriori.\nWe have applied the above approach to a computation of the cosmological constant of flat space in ref. [8], and to the Einstein Universe in ref. [19]. These toy Universes are respectively described by the manifoldsR\u00d7R3 and R\u00d7S3. Here the real line stands for the time variable, while S3 is a 3\u2013dimensional sphere endowed with the usual round metric.\nIn this paper we extend the analysis of refs. [8, 19] to the case when the spatial manifold is H3, 3\u2013dimensional hyperbolic space. Our Newtonian Universe is thus R\u00d7H3, with the real line standing for the time axis. In this way we exhaust all possible cases for a homogeneous, isotropic spacetime manifold as a realistic representation of our actual Universe (within the Newtonian limit, and modulo quotients by discrete groups, which will not be considered here). As before, our aim is to compute the numerical values of the cosmological constant and of the Boltzmann entropy of this Universe. Quantum calculations in hyperbolic space, including corrections to the cosmological constant, were reported long ago in refs. [4, 5].\nAs a solution to the Einstein field equations, hyperbolic space carries a negative value of the cosmological constant [39]. However, our result for \u039b is determined only up to a dimensionless real factor C\u039b. Although, on general grounds, C\u039b is expected to be of order unity, the choice of sign remains arbitrary. Here we will show that a choice of C\u039b > 0 exists such that it reproduces the experimentally determined value of \u039b > 0. In so doing one is not contradicting the fact that hyperbolic space carries \u039b < 0, since C\u039b remains arbitrary. Actually the real Universe is flat but has \u039b > 0. The same ambiguity in the sign of \u039b, due to an undetermined dimensionless factor, already arose in our analyses of flat space [8] and of spherical space [19].\nIn our use of special functions we follow the conventions of ref. [16]. In the notationXreg, the subscript reg indicates that the divergent quantityX has been regularised as indicated in the text."

This allows one to solve the Laplacian eigenvalue equation \u22072\u03c8 = \u03bb\u03c8 by separation of variables: \u03c8(r, \u03b8, \u03d5) = R\u03bbl(r)Ylm(\u03b8, \u03d5), with Ylm(\u03b8, \u03d5) a spherical harmonic on S2. The Laplacian eigenvalue equation is thus reduced to the ordinary differential equation\n1\nR20 sinh 2 r\n[\nd\ndr\n(\nsinh2 r d\ndr\n) \u2212 l(l + 1) ]\nR\u03bbl(r) = \u03bbR\u03bbl(r), (7)\nhereafter termed the radial wave equation. One finds the continuous spectrum [21]\n\u03bb = \u2212 1 R20 (k2 + 1), k \u2208 [0,\u221e). (8)\nWe will henceforth denote the radial eigenfunctionsR\u03bbl(r) as Rkl(r). Imposing regularity of the solution of Eq. (7) at r = 0 yields the 1\u2013dimensional eigenspace generated by the eigenfunction [22]\nRkl(r) = N \u22121/2 kl (sinh r) l (cosh r) ik\u2212l\u22121\n\u00d7F ( l + 1\u2212 ik 2 , l + 2\u2212 ik 2 ; l + 3 2 ; tanh2 r ) . (9)\nAbove, F (a, b; c; z) is the Gauss hypergeometric function [16]; the precise value of the normalisation constant Nkl can be looked up in ref. [22]. A second, linearly independent solution of Eq. (7) is singular at r = 0, hence discarded.\nSummarising, the Laplacian eigenfunctions \u03c8klm(r, \u03b8, \u03d5) = Rkl(r)Ylm(\u03b8, \u03d5) are orthonormal\n\u222b\nH3\nd\u00b5(r, \u03b8, \u03d5)\u03c8\u2217klm(r, \u03b8, \u03d5)\u03c8k\u2032l\u2032m\u2032(r, \u03b8, \u03d5) = \u03b4(k \u2212 k\u2032)\u03b4ll\u2032\u03b4mm\u2032 (10)\nand complete \u222b \u221e\n0\ndk \u221e \u2211\nl=0\nl \u2211\nm=\u2212l\n\u03c8\u2217klm(r, \u03b8, \u03d5)\u03c8klm(r \u2032, \u03b8\u2032, \u03d5\u2032)\n= 1\nsinh2 r sin \u03b8 \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032)\u03b4(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032)\u03b4(\u03d5 \u2212 \u03d5\u2032). (11)\nAs already done in refs. [8, 19] we will restrict our attention to radially symmetric states, i.e., to l = 0, m = 0. Let us denote the \u03c8k00(r) more simply by \u03c8k(r). Then the radially symmetric wavefunctions are given by\n\u03c8k(r) = (cosh r) ik\u22121 F\n( 1\u2212 ik 2 , 2\u2212 ik 2 ; 3 2 ; tanh2 r ) , k \u2208 [0,\u221e), (12)\nmodulo a normalisation factor to be specified later."

            "text": "The radially symmetric eigenfunctions (12), elegant though they are, turn out to be somewhat awkward to work with. Fortunately a more practical expression for the solutions (12) can be given along the lines first presented in ref. [18]. In order to obtain it we follow the method already applied in ref. [19] to the case of spherical space S3, duly adapted to hyperbolic space H3.\nBy inspection, the function defined by\nfq(r) = sinh(qr)\nsinh r , q \u2208 C (13)\nsatisfies the radial equation (7) with l = 0 whenever q = \u00b1ik. Hence we have a family of states with l = 0 given by\nf\u00b1ik(r) = \u00b1i sin(kr)\nsinh r , k \u2208 [0,\u221e). (14)\nDropping the irrelevant factor \u00b1i let us consider\nRk0(r) = sin(kr)\nsinh r . (15)\nWe claim that the function defined as1\nRkl(r) = sinh l r\n(\n1\nsinh r\nd\ndr\n)l\nRk0(r) (16)\nsatisfies the radial equation (7) with an arbitrary value of l \u2208 N. In order to prove the above statement we return to the radial Eq. (7), which we reexpress as\nd2Rkl dr2 + 2 coth r dRkl dr +\n[\n(k2 + 1)\u2212 l(l+ 1) sinh2 r\n]\nRkl = 0, (17)\nafter using Eq. (8). The change of dependent variable\nRkl(r) = sinh l r Ckl(r) (18)\nturns Eq. (17) into\nd2Ckl dr2 + 2(l + 1) coth r dCkl dr + [ l(l+ 2) + (k2 + 1) ] Ckl(r) = 0. (19)\nDifferentiating (19) once more one arrives at\nd3Ckl dr3 + 2(l+ 1) coth r d2Ckl dr2\n+ [ l(l + 2) + (k2 + 1)\u2212 2(l + 1) csch2r ] dCkl\ndr = 0. (20)\nWe claim that the ansatz dCkl dr = sinh r Ck,l+1 (21)\nfor the third\u2013order equation (20) yields a simple solution of the second\u2013order equation (19). Indeed, substitution of (21) into (20) produces\nd2Ck,l+1 dr2 +2(l+2) coth r dCk,l+1 dr + [ (l + 1)(l + 3) + (k2 + 1) ] Ck,l+1 = 0, (22)\n1We deliberately use the same notation Rkl as in Eq. (9) because, as will be shown below, the functions (16) are indeed the same family of functions as given in Eq. (9), modulo an irrelevant proportionality factor.\nwhich coincides with the radial Eq. (19) after the replacement l \u2192 l + 1. Thus the operator\nO = 1\nsinh r\nd\ndr (23)\nacts as a ladder operator, i.e.,\nO (Ckl(r)) = Ck,l+1(r). (24)\nTherefore Eq. (16) does provide the solution to the radial Eq. (17) for arbitrary values of k \u2208 [0,\u221e) and l \u2208 N; it is the only regular solution at r = 0. A second, linearly independent solution of Eq. (17) does exist, but it is singular at r = 0.\nTurning now our attention to the normalisation of the radial eigenstates (16), on\ngeneral grounds the orthogonality property\n\u3008Rkl|Rk\u2032l\u3009 = Nkl\u03b4(k \u2212 k\u2032), k, k\u2032 \u2208 [0,\u221e) (25) will hold for some value of Nkl \u2208 C. We do not need the normalisation factor Nkl in all generality, but only its value for the radially symmetric states l = 0. A simple computation proves that the eigenfunctions\n\u03c8k(r) = 1\u221a \u03c0 Rk0(r) = 1\u221a \u03c0 sin(kr) sinh r , k \u2208 [0,\u221e) (26)\nare orthonormal with respect to the scalar product on the left\u2013hand side of Eq. (10):\n\u3008\u03c8k|\u03c8k\u2032 \u3009 = \u03b4(k \u2212 k\u2032), k, k\u2032 \u2208 [0,\u221e). (27) The \u03c8k(r) above span a complete, orthonormal set within the subspace of radially symmetric Laplacian eigenfunctions.\nWe have deliberately used the same notation \u03c8k(r) for the eigenfunctions of Eqs. (26) and (12), because they are indeed the same set of functions (modulo normalisation). The reason for this is that the subspace of solutions to the radial Eq. (7) that are regular at r = 0 is 1\u2013dimensional. In fact the following remarkable identity holds true:\nF\n( 1\u2212 ik 2 , 2\u2212 ik 2 ; 3 2 ; tanh2 r ) = sin(kr) (cosh r)1\u2212ik k sinh r . (28)\nDespite the vastly different appearance of the functions on the two sides, the above identity holds for all r \u2208 (0,\u221e) and all k \u2208 [0,\u221e) thanks to Eq. 9.121.19 of ref. [16], after an appropriate analytic continuation of the latter to the complex plane."

We can however regularise it by the introduction of RU as an infrared cutoff; this we can implement as follows. In the metric (3) the radial coordinate r is dimensionless, the dimensions of length arising from the factor R0. Setting R0 = RU , the coordinate value r = 1 corresponds to the physical distanceRU . Within the radially symmetric subspace of Hilbert space, the regularised entropy operator is represented by the matrix\n\u3008\u03c8k|S(r)|\u03c8k\u2032 \u3009reg = 4 CSkBMH0R 2 U\n~\n\u222b 1\n0 dr sinh2 r sin(kr) sin(k\u2032r), k, k\u2032 \u2208 [0,\u221e).

The maximum amplitude is reached in the first oscillation (when k \u2208 (0, 2)), with fmax \u2243 3. In order to verify that our model complies with the holographic principle, we replace f(k) by its maximum value, fmax \u2243 3, thus obtaining the estimate\n\u3008\u03c8k|S(r)|\u03c8k\u3009reg \u2264 CSkBMH0R 2 U\n2~ 3.

            "text": "We have computed the cosmological constant \u039b and the Boltzmann entropy S of a hyperbolic Universe R \u00d7 H3 in the Newtonian limit. To this end we have modelled the cosmological fluid as the quantum probability fluid (a perfect fluid) of a free, nonrelativistic particle governed by Schroedinger quantum mechanics [6, 10]. This particle is assumed to possess a massM equal to that of the total mass (baryonic plus dark) of the observable Universe. The particle being free, its energy eigenstates are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator \u22072 on the spatial manifold H3. A complete, orthonormal set of such eigenfunctions \u03c8klm (Eqs. (10), (11)) can been borrowed from the existing literature [22]; see also ref. [24]. However, upon restriction to radially symmetric states for isotropy, we have found it more convenient to work with the eigenfunctions \u03c8k of Eq. (26), used thereafter.\nNext, quantum operators \u039b and S (respectively given by Eqs. (29) and (30)) can be identified, such that they represent the cosmological constant and the Boltzmann entropy of this Universe. The specific choice made for the entropy operator S is motivated by the entropic approach to gravity of ref. [33]. In the Newtonian limit of this latter scenario, gravitational equipotential surfaces qualify as isoentropic surfaces.\nWe have finally evaluated the expectation values of the two quantum operators \u039b and S in the radially symmetric quantum states \u03c8k representing the matter contents of our hyperbolic Universe; our results are presented in Eqs. (32) and (35). Specifically, the expectation value \u3008\u03c8k|S|\u03c8k\u3009 measures the gravitational entropy of the Universe\nwhen the matter it contains finds itself in the quantum state \u03c8k, while \u3008\u03c8k|\u039b|\u03c8k\u3009 measures the corresponding cosmological constant.\nThe radial quantum number k \u2208 [0,\u221e) is (proportional to) the modulus of the momentum. We find that the best fit to the experimentally determined value of \u039b occurs around k = 4. It is also worth remarking that the corresponding \u3008\u03c8k|S|\u03c8k\u3009 saturates, but does not violate, the upper bound set by the holographic principle on the maximal entropy content of the Universe. These conclusions are in line with the corresponding ones drawn in flat space [8] and in spherical space [19].\nWe recall that both ultraviolet (r \u2192 0) and infrared (r \u2192 \u221e) regularisations were needed in flat space [8] in order to make physical sense of the expectation values \u3008\u03c8k|\u039b|\u03c8k\u3009 and \u3008\u03c8k|S|\u03c8k\u3009. On the contrary, spherical space [19] required no regularisation at all, neither infrared nor ultraviolet. Finally hyperbolic space as worked out here only required infrared regularisation. Thus nonvanishing curvature does away with the need for ultraviolet regularisation, but infrared regularisation remains necessary whenever space is noncompact.\nTo round up our discussion it is instructive to discuss the eigenvalues \u03bbk of the Laplacian \u22072 as functions of the radial quantum number k, and also in their dependence on the scalar curvature of the spatial manifold considered. For the cases when the latter is flat space R3 [8], spherical space S3 [19], and hyperbolic space H3 as analysed here, the following spectra are found in the literature (normalising the radii R0 of the manifolds S3 and H3 to unity):\neigenvalues of \u22072 range of k R3 \u2212k2 k \u2208 [0,\u221e) S3 \u2212k(k + 2) k \u2208 N H3 \u2212(k2 + 1) k \u2208 [0,\u221e)\n(39)\nAs was to be expected, only the compact manifold S3 leads to a discrete spectrum, while the two noncompact manifolds R3 and H3 possess continuous spectra. In all three cases, \u2212\u22072 is a nonnegative operator as befits a kinetic energy. One can regard terms in \u03bbk additional to \u2212k2 as due to nonvanishing scalar curvature. Thus curvature corrections to the flat case cause the kinetic energy to increase with respect to their flat\u2013space counterpart. In flat space and also in spherical space, the state with zero momentum k = 0 also has zero kinetic energy. However, hyperbolic space allows a nonvanishing kinetic energy even when the momentum k vanishes. Thus the hyperbolic Laplacian is not just nonnegative, but strictly positive; this is also a curvature effect.\nAcknowledgements This research was supported by grant no.
