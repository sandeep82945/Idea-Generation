    "abstractText": "The hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakarensis utilizes amino acids as a carbon and energy source. Multiple aminotransferases, along with glutamate dehydrogenase, are presumed to be involved in the catabolic conversion of amino acids. T. kodakarensis harbors seven Class I aminotransferase homologs on its genome. Here we examined the biochemical properties and physiological roles of two Class I aminotransferases. The TK0548 protein was produced in Escherichia coli and the TK2268 protein in T. kodakarensis. Purified TK0548 protein preferred Phe, Trp, Tyr, and His, and to a lower extent, Leu, Met and Glu. The TK2268 protein preferred Glu and Asp, with lower activities toward Cys, Leu, Ala, Met and Tyr. Both proteins recognized 2-oxoglutarate as the amino acceptor. The TK0548 protein exhibited the highest kcat/Km value toward Phe, followed by Trp, Tyr, and His. The TK2268 protein exhibited highest kcat/Km values for Glu and Asp. The TK0548 and TK2268 genes were individually disrupted, and both disruption strains displayed a retardation in growth on a minimal amino acid medium, suggesting their involvement in amino acid metabolism. Activities in the cell-free extracts of the disruption strains and the host strain were examined. The results suggested that the TK0548 protein contributes to the conversion of Trp, Tyr and His, and the TK2268 protein to that of Asp and His. Although other aminotransferases seem to contribute to the transamination of Phe, Trp, Tyr, Asp, and Glu, our results suggest that the TK0548 protein is responsible for the majority of aminotransferase activity toward His in T. kodakarensis. The genetic examination carried out in this study provides insight into the contributions of the two aminotransferases toward specific amino acids in vivo, an aspect which had not been thoroughly considered thus far.",

Multiple aminotransferases, along with glutamate dehydrogenase, are presumed to be\u00a0 involved in the catabolic conversion of amino acids. T. kodakarensis harbors seven Class I\u00a0aminotransferase homologs on its genome. Here we\u00a0 examined the biochemical properties and physiological roles of two Class I\u00a0 aminotransferases. The TK0548 protein was produced in Escherichia coli and the TK2268 protein in T. kodakarensis. Purified TK0548 protein preferred Phe, Trp, Tyr, and His, and to a lower extent, Leu, Met and Glu. The TK2268 protein preferred Glu and Asp, with lower activities toward Cys, Leu, Ala, Met and Tyr. Both proteins recognized 2-oxoglutarate as the amino acceptor. The TK0548 protein exhibited the highest kcat/Km value toward Phe, followed by Trp, Tyr, and His. The TK2268 protein exhibited highest kcat/Km values for Glu and Asp. The TK0548 and TK2268 genes were individually disrupted, and both disruption strains displayed a retardation in growth on a minimal amino acid medium, suggesting their involvement in amino acid metabolism. Activities in the cell-free extracts of the disruption strains and the host strain were examined. The results suggested that the TK0548 protein contributes to the conversion of Trp, Tyr and His, and the TK2268 protein to that of Asp and His. Although other aminotransferases seem to contribute to the transamination of Phe, Trp, Tyr, Asp, and Glu, our results suggest that the TK0548 protein is responsible for the majority of aminotransferase activity toward His in T. kodakarensis. The genetic examination carried out in this study provides insight into the contributions of the two aminotransferases toward specific amino acids in vivo, an aspect which had not been thoroughly considered thus far.\nKEYWORDS\nArchaea, aminotransferase, metabolism, enzyme, genetics\nIntroduction\nAminotransferases, or transaminases, catalyze the reversible transfer of an amino group from a donor to a keto group of an acceptor compound (Toyokawa et\u00a0al., 2021; Koper et\u00a0al., 2022). The reaction is dependent on pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP). Many aminotransferases recognize the \u03b1-amino group of \u03b1-amino acids and the keto group of 2-oxoacids, but some"

The enzymes play a pivotal role in the carbon and nitrogen metabolism in a wide range of organisms. Aminotransferases are a focus of attention due to their involvement in a variety of diseases (Kunutsor et\u00a0al., 2013; Montioli et\u00a0al., 2021) and are also attractive enzymes for their use in biocatalysis (Malik et\u00a0al., 2012; Gomm and O'Reilly, 2018; Kelly et\u00a0al., 2020).\nAminotransferases can be\u00a0divided into four classes (Class I\u00a0to IV) based on their primary structure (Mehta et\u00a0al., 1993). On the other hand, PLP-dependent enzymes can be\u00a0classified by their folds (Fold type I\u00a0to VII; Jansonius, 1998; Schneider et\u00a0al., 2000; Koper et\u00a0al., 2022). Aminotransferase Class I, II, and IV share a common ancestor with a Fold type I\u00a0whereas Class III aminotransferases are members of Fold type IV PLP enzymes (Mehta et\u00a0al., 1993). Class I\u00a0enzymes constitute the majority of aminotransferases, including aromatic aminotransferases, aspartate aminotransferases, and alanine aminotransferases. Class II includes enzymes that can recognize amino groups other than the \u03b1-amino group of amino acids and utilize substrates such as \u03b3-aminobutyric acid, or GABA, and ornithine. Class III enzymes with the distinct fold type IV utilize D-amino acids and branched-chain amino acids. Class IV enzymes utilize Ser, O-phosphoserine or Asp as the amino donor (Mehta et\u00a0al., 1993; Mehta and Christen, 2000; Koper et\u00a0al., 2022).\nThermococcales consists of three genera, Pyrococcus, Thermococcus, and Palaeococcus, and members readily utilize amino acids and peptides as a carbon and energy source for growth (Zillig et\u00a0 al., 1983; Fiala and Stetter, 1986; Takai et\u00a0 al., 2000). Different enzymes and pathways involved in amino acid catabolism and biosynthesis have been studied in these organisms. In particular, the enzymatic properties of a wide range of aminotransferases from Pyrococcus furiosus (Andreotti et\u00a0al., 1995; Ward et\u00a0al., 2000, 2002), Pyrococcus horikoshii (Matsui et\u00a0al., 2000; Ura et\u00a0al., 2001; Okada et\u00a0al., 2012, 2014), Thermococcus litoralis (Andreotti et\u00a0al., 1994; Sakuraba et\u00a0al., 2004, 2008), Thermococcus sp. CKU-1 (Uchida et\u00a0al., 2014) and Thermococcus kodakarensis (Kanai et\u00a0al., 2015; Zheng et\u00a0al., 2018) have been reported. Our group has been examining amino acid metabolism in T. kodakarensis (Shikata et\u00a0al., 2007; Yokooji et\u00a0al., 2013; Awano et\u00a0al., 2014). In addition to the genome sequence (Fukui et\u00a0al., 2005), a versatile genetic system (Sato et\u00a0al., 2003, 2005; Matsumi et\u00a0al., 2007; Santangelo et\u00a0al., 2008, 2010) allows us to evaluate the physiological roles of individual genes in this organism.\nA biochemical and genetic examination of enzymes/genes involved in Glu metabolism in T. kodakarensis confirmed the presence of glutamate dehydrogenase (TK1431), catalyzing an NADPdependent interconversion between Glu and 2-oxoglutarate (Yokooji et\u00a0al., 2013). The functions of 2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (TK1123-TK1125, TK1131) and ADP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase (TK1880, TK0943; Shikata et\u00a0al., 2007) were also identified, constituting a route from Glu to succinate. The latter two reactions lead to the generation of reduced ferredoxin and ATP coupled to 2-oxoacid degradation, providing reducing equivalents and chemical energy (Yokooji et\u00a0al., 2013). The presence of four 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases and five ADP-forming acyl-CoA synthetases in T. kodakarensis suggest that other amino acids are catabolized through similar reactions. Based on the substrate specificities of the acyl-CoA synthetases (Mai and Adams, 1996; Glasemacher et\u00a0al., 1997; Musfeldt et\u00a0al., 1999; Shikata et\u00a0al., 2007; Awano et\u00a0al., 2014), it was suggested\nthat the following amino acids are subject to catabolism; Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Phe, Tyr, Trp, Glu/Gln, Cys, and His (Awano et\u00a0al., 2014). However, dehydrogenases acting on amino acids other than Glu such as aspartate dehydrogenase and alanine dehydrogenase have been genetically confirmed to be\u00a0absent in T. kodakarensis (Yokooji et\u00a0al., 2013). This implies that 2-oxoacid generation from amino acids relies on aminotransferases. In order to better understand which amino acids are subject to catabolic degradation and which aminotransferases are involved, here we\u00a0 carried out a biochemical and genetic examination on two aminotransferases in T. kodakarensis encoded by TK0548 and TK2268."

            "text": "Multiple groups of aminotransferase homologs in Thermococcales\nFigure\u00a01 shows a phylogenetic tree of Class I\u00a0aminotransferase homologs from four selected Thermococcales species, T. kodakarensis, P. furiosus, P. horikoshii, and T. litoralis, from which multiple aminotransferases have been experimentally studied. A clade including TK1990, a representative of a Class IV protein encoding cysteine desulfurase (Hidese et\u00a0al., 2014), was used as the outgroup. There are eight groups (G1\u2013G8) in which homologs occur in ten or more genomes of the 40 Thermococcales species examined. Among the eight groups, members of G1 (39 genomes among the 40 genomes examined harbor homologs; 39/40), G2 (40/40), G3 (40/40), G6 (40/40), and G8 (35/40) are present in most or all of the Thermococcales genomes used in our analysis. Members of G4 (12/40), G5 (10/40), and G7 (20/40) are less distributed. T. litoralis harbors a higher number of Class I\u00a0 aminotransferase homologs compared to the other three species. Homologs of OCC_03517 are not found on any of the other Thermococcales genomes, but homologs of OCC_10965 (3/40), OCC_02240 (10/40, G5), and OCC_11814 (5/40) can be\u00a0identified in other species. A detailed phylogenetic tree based on sequences of all Class I\u00a0 aminotransferase homologs from Thermococcales species is shown in Supplementary Figure S1.\nWe considered the physiological roles of these groups of aminotransferases by first taking into account their gene location and previous biochemical studies on aminotransferases from members of Thermococcales. In terms of gene location, we\u00a0observed that TK0250 (G7) is included within the His biosynthesis gene cluster (TK0242-TK0251) in T. kodakarensis. We\u00a0 also observed a complete co-occurrence between the TK0250 homologs and the His biosynthesis operon in Thermococcales members (Supplementary Table S1). A similar situation was observed for TK0260 (G4). The gene is situated in a gene cluster (TK0259-TK0261) involved in the biosynthesis of Phe/Tyr in T. kodakarensis, and co-occurrence is observed between TK0260 homologs and the gene cluster in Thermococcales species (Supplementary Table S2). These observations suggest that the physiological roles of members of G4 and G7 are related to Phe/Tyr and His biosynthesis, respectively. The members of G8 from Thermococcales have not been characterized, but display 30% identity to Thr decarboxylase (encoded by MM2060) from Methanosarcina mazei (Tavares et\u00a0al., 2018, 2019) and are clustered with genes related to cobalamin salvage. By contrast, members of G1, G2, G3, G5, and G6 did not show a tendency to be\u00a0included in a particular biosynthesis operon or gene cluster.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.org\nMembers of G1, G2, G3, and G6 are widely distributed among Thermococcales species, and a number of members have been biochemically characterized. In particular, members of G1 and G6 have been relatively well studied. In the case of G1, the structure of the PH1371 protein from P. horikoshii has been elucidated, and the amino donors most recognized were Tyr, Phe, Glu, His, and Trp (Matsui et\u00a0al., 2000). The PF1253 protein from P. furiosus, referred to as AroAT II, displayed preference to Phe, Tyr and Trp, with highest kcat/Km toward Phe (Ward et\u00a0 al., 2002). The OCC_04737 protein from T. litoralis, referred to as ArAT II, also displayed similar properties, preferring Phe, Tyr, and Trp (Andreotti et\u00a0al., 1994). In the case of G6, the PF0121 protein from P. furiosus, referred to as ArAT or AroAT I, displayed significant activity toward Phe, Trp, and Tyr (Andreotti et\u00a0al., 1995). The OCC_04335 protein from T. litoralis, referred to as ArAT I, also recognized Phe, Tyr, and Trp (Andreotti et\u00a0al., 1994). The PH0207 protein displays kynurenine aminotransferase activity which is involved in the degradation of Trp (Okada et\u00a0al., 2012), and the crystal structure has been determined (Chon et\u00a0al., 2005; Okada et\u00a0al., 2014). Concerning other groups, the PF1497 protein from P. furiosus (G3), referred to as AlaAT, displays highest activity with Ala. The enzyme did not display activity toward Phe and Tyr (Ward et\u00a0al., 2000). A genetic analysis on TK1094 from T. kodakarensis (G3)\nFIGURE\u00a01 Phylogenetic analysis of Class I\u00a0aminotransferases from selected species of Thermococcales. Amino acid sequences were collected from T. kodakarensis, T. litoralis, P. furiosus, and P. horikoshii. Homologs of cysteine desulfurase (TK1990) were added into the dataset as an outgroup. The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE algorithm (Edgar, 2004). The phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Maximum Likelihood method and JTT matrix-based model (Jones et\u00a0al., 1992). The tree with the highest log likelihood (\u22129712.68) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Bootstrap values above 50 are shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the JTT model, then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. This analysis involved 32 amino acid sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated (complete deletion option). There were a total of 242 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA11 (Tamura et\u00a0al., 2021). Homologs that have been characterized genetically or biochemically are indicated with black arrowheads. Information on the groups or occurrence is indicated in the text.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org\nsuggested a role in the conversion between pyruvate and Ala (Kanai et\u00a0al., 2015). The PF1702 protein (G4), referred to as AspAT, displays highest activity toward Asp and Glu, with low activities to a broad range of amino acids (Ward et\u00a0al., 2002).\nWe carried out further analyses on TK2268 and TK0548. The TK2268 protein is a member of G2, which does not have any member that has been experimentally characterized. Determining its biochemical properties would contribute to our understanding of amino acid metabolism in T. kodakarensis. We\u00a0also examined the TK0548 protein, the most closely related protein to the TK2268 protein (45.4% identical). None of the G1 and G2 genes have been examined genetically.\nExpression of the TK0548 and TK2268 genes and purification of the recombinant proteins\nIn order to obtain recombinant proteins, the TK0548 and TK2268 genes were expressed in Escherichia coli. In the case of TK0548, soluble protein was obtained, and the recombinant TK0548 protein was purified through heat treatment, anion exchange chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography. In the case of TK2268, expression in E. coli resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies. The gene was thus expressed in the native host T. kodakarensis under the control of a strong constitutive promoter of the cell surface glycoprotein gene (csg, TK0895; Yokooji et\u00a0al., 2009). Sequences to incorporate a His6-tag on the C-terminus of the TK2268 protein were introduced. The soluble TK2268 protein obtained in the cell extract of T. kodakarensis cells was purified using a nickel affinity column and gel filtration chromatography. Both proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, confirming their apparent homogeneities (Figure\u00a02).\nOligomeric state of the TK0548 and TK2268 proteins\nThe molecular masses of the purified, recombinant TK0548 and TK2268 proteins were examined with gel-filtration chromatography. The estimated molecular mass of the TK0548 protein was 85 kDa, and considering that the calculated molecular mass of the monomer was 43,608 Da, this suggested that the TK0548 protein was a dimer. In the case of the TK2268 protein, we\u00a0 consistently observed two peaks, corresponding to estimated molecular masses of 98 kDa and 327 kDa. As the calculated molecular mass of the monomer was 45,116 Da, the result suggested that the TK2268 protein forms a dimer unit, which may then further assemble to form an octamer.\nThe TK0548 and TK2268 proteins catalyze transamination in a PLP-dependent manner\nThe purified TK0548 and TK2268 proteins were examined for aminotransferase activity. We\u00a0used Glu (10 mM) as the amino group donor and pyruvate (10 mM) as the amino acceptor. We\u00a0observed aminotransferase activity in both proteins. When PLP was omitted from the reaction, we\u00a0observed a partial decrease in activity in both cases (TK0548: 13% decrease, TK2268: 50% decrease) compared to those observed with the addition of PLP, suggesting that the TK0548 and TK2268 proteins are PLP-dependent aminotransferases. The only partial decrease in activity is most likely due to PLP bound to the proteins when they were produced in their respective host cells, E. coli (TK0548) and T. kodakarensis (TK2268). To further support the necessity of PLP for the reactions, we\u00a0added hydroxylamine, a PLP inhibitor (Kito et\u00a0al., 1978) to the enzymes in the absence of supplemental PLP. In this case, we\u00a0observed a further 93% decrease in activity of the TK0548 protein and a 78% decrease in activity of the TK2268 protein with the addition of hydroxylamine (Supplementary Figure S2).\nTransamination with varying amino donor and acceptor compounds\nWe first carried out an initial screening to identify the amino acids recognized by the TK0548 and TK2268 proteins. 2-Oxoglutarate or pyruvate was used as the amino acceptor, and the production of Glu or Ala, respectively, was examined after 15 min. The substrates were present in the reaction mixture at a concentration of 10 mM. As shown in Figure\u00a03A, the TK0548 protein utilized Phe, Tyr, His, and Trp as an amino donor, as well as Met, Glu, and Leu to a lower extent. In the case of the TK2268 protein, Asp and Glu were utilized, along with Tyr, Leu, Ala, Met, and Cys (Figure\u00a03B).\nFocusing on the amino acids that were recognized by the proteins, we\u00a0examined enzyme activity. The amino acids and amino acceptors were constant at 10 mM. As shown in Figure\u00a04A, the TK0548 protein exhibited highest activity toward Tyr, followed by Phe, Trp, and His. Activity toward Leu, Met, and Glu were much lower. On the other hand, the TK2268 protein displayed highest activity toward Glu, followed by Asp. Lower levels of activity were observed using Cys, Leu, Ala, Met, and Tyr (Figure\u00a04B).\nA B\nFIGURE\u00a02 SDS-PAGE analyses of the purified TK0548 (A) and TK2268 (B) recombinant proteins.

For the TK0548 protein, activities were first measured for varying concentrations of pyruvate or 2-oxoglutarate in the presence of 10 mM Phe. As shown in Table\u00a01, the TK0548 protein exhibited a higher Vmax and lower Km toward 2-oxoglutarate when compared to pyruvate. The kcat/Km value toward 2-oxoglutarate was over 70-fold higher than that for pyruvate. We\u00a0next examined activity with varying concentrations of Phe, Tyr, Trp, His, and Met in the presence of 10 mM 2-oxoglutarate (Table\u00a01). The highest kcat/Km\nvalue was observed with Phe, with high values also observed for Tyr and Trp. A lower kcat/Km value was observed with His, and that for Met was extremely low.

The kcat/Km value toward 2-oxoglutarate was higher than that toward pyruvate (Table\u00a02). This was mainly due to differences in the Km value, as their Vmax values were comparable.

Five transformants were chosen for each gene disruption and their loci were examined by PCR. Examples of transformants whose TK0548 gene (Figure\u00a0 5A) or TK2268 gene (Figure\u00a0 5B) was disrupted are shown. The respective loci were sequenced, confirming that gene disruption had occurred as intended.\nThe \u0394TK0548 and \u0394TK2268 disruption strains were first grown in the nutrient-rich ASW-YT-m1-S0 medium containing yeast extract and tryptone (Figure\u00a06A). The growth of both disruption strains did not display significant differences to that of the host strain KU216. Therefore, in order to increase the dependency of growth on amino acid catabolism, the strains were grown in ASW-AA-m1-S0(+Ura) medium (Figure\u00a06B). This medium is a synthetic medium with amino acids as the only major carbon and energy source. In this case, we\u00a0observed a retardation in growth in both gene disruption strains. Cell yields of the cultures eventually reached similar levels, but the gene disruption strains took a 4-h longer period of time to reach maximum cell density. The results suggest that both proteins are involved in the utilization of amino acids for growth of T. kodakarensis.\nAminotransferase activity in Thermococcus kodakarensis cell extracts\nThe substrate specificities of multiple aminotransferases from members of Thermococcales have been determined in vitro. However, the contribution of each protein in the conversion of a particular amino acid in vivo cannot be\u00a0determined by biochemical properties alone, as multiple aminotransferases, in some cases with overlapping substrate specificities or different expression levels, are present in the cell. We\u00a0thus measured and compared aminotransferase activity in the cell extracts of T. kodakarensis host strain and gene disruption strains. As in vitro studies indicated that the TK0548 protein preferred Trp, Phe, Tyr, and His, while the TK2268 protein recognized Asp and Glu, activities in the cell extracts toward Trp, Phe, Tyr, His, Asp, and Glu were measured.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 07 frontiersin.org\nWe\u00a0also used Ile as an amino donor. In vitro studies indicated that the recognition of both TK0548 and TK2268 proteins toward Ile was minimal (Figure\u00a03), so the effects of TK0548 and TK2268 disruption on intracellular aminotransferase activity toward Ile would be\u00a0expected to be\u00a0low. As shown in Figure\u00a07, aminotransferase activity for all seven amino acids was clearly observed in KU216 cell extracts. We\u00a0observed that the levels of aminotransferase activity toward different amino acids greatly differed. Activities toward Phe or Glu were particularly high, whereas that toward Asp was notably low, two orders of magnitude lower than those observed for Phe or Glu. When we\u00a0examined the effects of gene disruption, the disruption of TK0548 and TK2268 had no effect on intracellular aminotransferase activity toward Ile, consistent with our in vitro results that neither enzyme recognized Ile (Figure\u00a03). We\u00a0next examined differences observed upon gene disruption, focusing on those with p values below 0.01. We\u00a0observed that the disruption of TK2268 resulted in a 35% decrease in aminotransferase activity toward Asp, one of the substrates preferred by the protein in in vitro experiments. Disruption of TK2268 did not affect the Glu aminotransferase activity in cell extracts, suggesting that the contribution of the protein to this activity is relatively small. This is not surprising though, as in vitro analysis indicated that the activity of the TK2268 protein toward Glu and Asp are comparable (Table\u00a02). As the total Glu aminotransferase activity in T. kodakarensis cell extracts is over 100-fold higher than that toward Asp, a decrease in Glu aminotransferase activity comparable to the levels toward Asp would correspond to only a very small fraction of the total activity toward Glu. We\u00a0also observed a decrease in His aminotransferase activity, but this could not be\u00a0 explained by the results of in vitro analysis. When TK0548 was disrupted, decreases in activity toward Trp (32%), Tyr (64%), and His (89%) were observed. The TK0548 protein seems to be\u00a0 a major contributor for Tyr and His aminotransferase activity in T. kodakarensis."

            "text": "Biochemical studies have been carried out on wealth of aminotransferases from Thermococcales species. Proteins from T. kodakarensis, P. furiosus, P. horikoshii, and T. litoralis that are\nclassified in the Class I\u00a0to Class IV aminotransferases are listed in Table\u00a03. Some proteins have been shown to catalyze reactions other than transamination, and include racemases, decarboxylases, desulfurases, hydroxymethyltransferases and others. Concerning the aminotransferases that have been biochemically examined, the amino donor and acceptor molecules are indicated. The TK0548 protein was shown here to prefer the aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr and Trp, which is consistent with other members of G1. To a lower degree, the protein also recognized His. The PH1371 protein also displays activity toward His (Matsui et\u00a0al., 2000). The activities of the PF1253 (Ward et\u00a0al., 2002) and OCC_04737 (Andreotti et\u00a0al., 1994) proteins toward His have not been examined. In the case of the TK2268 protein, it is the first characterized representative of G2, and displays specificity toward the acidic amino acids Asp and Glu. Although the range of substrates examined in separate studies differ, enzymes that belong to the same group have been shown to display similar substrate specificities, such as the four enzymes from G1 and the three enzymes from G6. Our results with the TK2268 protein thus raise the possibilities that members of G2 recognize acidic amino acids as amino donors.\nIn order to understand the contribution of each enzyme to the transamination of a specific amino acid in vivo, we\u00a0examined and compared specific aminotransferase activities among cells of the host strain KU216 and \u0394TK0548 and \u0394TK2268 disruption strains. This takes into account not only the substrate specificity and activity levels of each enzyme, but also their expression levels in the cell. The results suggested that TK0548 contributed to the aminotransferase activity toward Phe and Trp, and to a higher degree Tyr. The considerable levels of activity still observed in the disruption strains most likely reflects the activity of the TK0186 protein, a member of G6 (Table\u00a03). Interestingly, the TK0548 protein seems to be\u00a0the predominant His aminotransferase in T. kodakarensis, accounting for approximately 90% of the activity in cell extracts.\nAmino acid catabolism in members of the Thermococcales proceeds via amino acid, 2-oxoacid, acyl-CoA and acid (Figure\u00a08). Concerning the conversion from amino acids to 2-oxoacids, our group has previously shown that Glu is the only amino acid that is converted by a dehydrogenase, a glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by TK1431.

The 2-oxoacids are converted to acyl-CoAs via 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases. There are seven potential sets of genes encoding 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases in members of the Thermococcales, and four protein complexes from P. furiosus have been biochemically examined; pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR), 2-ketoisovalerate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (VOR), indolepyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (IOR), and 2-ketoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (KGOR) (Blamey and Adams, 1993; Mai and Adams, 1994; Heider et\u00a0al., 1996; Mai and Adams, 1996). The KGOR homolog in T. kodakarensis has been genetically examined, confirming its role in Glu metabolism, converting 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA (Yokooji et\u00a0al., 2013).

ACS I\u00a0and ACS II from P. furiosus and ACS II, ACS III, SCS and ICS from T. kodakarensis have been biochemically examined (Mai and Adams, 1996; Glasemacher et\u00a0al., 1997; Musfeldt et\u00a0al., 1999; Shikata et\u00a0al., 2007; Awano et\u00a0al., 2014). The involvement of SCS in Glu metabolism has been genetically confirmed (Yokooji et\u00a0al., 2013). As the NDP-forming acyl-CoA synthetases catalyze the reaction in which substrate-level phosphorylation occurs, it is possible to predict the amino acids that are subject to this catabolism based on the substrate specificities of the acyl-CoA synthetases. The substrates recognized by the five acyl-CoA synthetases combined suggest that the amino acids that are subject to this mode of catabolism are Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Tyr, Trp, Glu/Gln, Cys, and His (Awano et\u00a0al., 2014). Aminotransferases that recognize Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Tyr, Trp, and Glu/Gln have been reported, as well as 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases that act on the corresponding 2-oxoacids after transamination. However, aminotransferases and 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases that are related to Cys and His degradation are still not known. In particular, ICS displays a remarkably high specificity toward 2-(imidazol-4-yl)-acetate, suggesting that it is involved solely in His metabolism (Awano et\u00a0al., 2014). The results of this study strongly suggest that the TK0548 protein and ICS are metabolically linked in His catabolism (Figure\u00a08). To a certain extent, the TK0548 protein also contributes in the catabolism of aromatic amino acids, particularly Tyr. Finally, the specificities of the five acyl-CoA synthetases combined raise the possibilities that Asp, Asn, Gly, Lys, Arg,\nFrontiers in Microbiology 11 frontiersin.org\nPro, Ser, and Thr may not be\u00a0 directed to the catabolic degradation involving 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases and NDP-forming acyl-CoA synthetases, and this may be\u00a0related to the notably low Asp aminotransferase activity observed in T. kodakarensis cell extracts and the TK2268 protein. As we\u00a0have previously shown that T. kodakarensis does not harbor an Asp dehydrogenase, our present knowledge suggests that Asp is not catabolized through the pathway involving 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases and NDP-forming acyl-CoA synthetases. We\u00a0also could not find an aspartate ammonia lyase homolog on the genome, which would lead to the generation of fumarate. In addition, T. kodakarensis possesses a fumarase homolog, but lacks a number of homologs of the citric acid cycle including succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase. Other than the TK2268 protein, enzymes potentially related to oxaloacetate metabolism are a putative fumarase, malic enzyme (Fukuda et\u00a0al., 2005), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Fukuda et\u00a0al., 2004). T. kodakarensis may display a C4-compound metabolism distinct to those found in bacteria. Further understanding of oxaloacetate metabolism may provide valuable clues to elucidate the metabolism of Asp and the physiological function of TK2268. We\u00a0would like to note, however, that we\u00a0cannot rule out the possibility that the TK2268 protein recognizes a substrate completely different from those considered in this study."

For disrupting the TK0548 gene, the region from the start codon to base number 1080 of TK0548 gene was deleted instead of the stop codon to avoid disturbing expression of the overlapping downstream gene. In the case of TK2268, the entire coding region, along with 9 bases of its 3\u2032-flanking region, was deleted. The TK0548 and TK2268 genes along with their 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-flanking regions (~1.0 kbp) were amplified from the genome of T. kodakarensis KU216 using the primer sets dTK0548F1/R1 and dTK2268F1/R1 (Table\u00a04).

The sequences of relevant regions were confirmed by DNA sequencing.\nThermococcus kodakarensis KU216 was cultivated in ASW-YTm1-S0 medium for 12 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of 0.8 \u00d7 ASW-m1, then kept on ice for 30 min. After addition of 3.0 \u03bcg of the disruption plasmid and further incubation on ice for 1 h, cells were cultivated in ASW-AA-m1-S0 medium without uracil for 48 h at 85\u00b0C. A 200 \u03bcL aliquot was inoculated into fresh ASW-AAm1-S0 medium and further cultivated under the same conditions to enrich transformants displaying uracil prototrophy.
