INTRODUCTION\nIn a previous work [1] we have developed a procedure to connect any two quantum systems on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space via a local transformation. This correspondence is a useful tool to map quantum systems in order to study one of them through the other one. This allows us to state that quantum systems described using finitedimensional Hilbert spaces are, in principle, intersimulatable. By this we mean that we have proved that there exists a transformation linking one to the other.\nGiven that the dynamics of such quantum systems is governed by the Schro\u0308dinger equation, we have described a general recipe for constructing a classical electrical network capable of finding a solution of the Schro\u0308dinger equation from certain electrical signals. In this paper we intend to show how this can be done.\nWe said that a productive and promising field to apply these ideas may be the quantum simulations [1]. A quantum simulator is conceived as a controllable system whose aim\n\u2217 mcaruso@fidesol.org\nis to mimic the static or dynamical properties of another quantum system [2]. For any two quantum systems on respective finite dimensional Hilbert spaces are connected via a gauge transformation. In that work we tried to deal with the topic of quantum simulation from an alternative perspective, starting from a more well-known one, in the sense that the last one can be analytically soluble and/or simulatable, the first part is described in [1]. But in this work we will show that the time evolution, a la Schro\u0308dinger, of such quantum systems can be efficiently realized by a classical electrical network as an analog simulator. One approach to realize simulations of this equivalent quantum systems is through classical electrical networks. We will construct a classical system in which certain dynamic quantities (voltages or currents) will evolve in time as does the wave function of a given quantum system, on a Hilbert space of finite dimension. This constitutes what is called an analog simulation of such systems.\nIn this work we describe and generalize precisely the ideas proposed in [3, 4] in order to simulate quantum systems through specific\ncircuits. It is possible to use such classical systems which their controllability is simpler than for quantum systems in general, in order to adequately describe its temporal evolution. We will use this equivalence between quantum systems in order to prove that a general simulation protocol is possible to implement using classical circuits."

            "text": "In previous works Rosner [6] has proposed an interesting analogy between particular quantum system and a classical system of electrical oscillators. This concrete proposal has been formalized and experimentally performed in [3, 4]. In this paper we will to generalize this formalization in order to include quantum systems over an arbitrary finite-dimensional Hilbert space.\nWe can consider without loss of generality, a time-independent and self-adjoint hamiltonian operator, represented by a constant hermitian matrix H . Let\u2019s start by rewriting (1) using the decomplexification procedure a la Arnold [7, 8], also called realification of the space Cn through the operator D:Cn\u2212\u2192R2n, explicitly defined as D(\u03c8):=(Re(\u03c8), Im(\u03c8))t=(\u03d51,\u03d52) t; which separates the real and the imaginary part of the complex \u03c8 . The equation (1) take the form of two separate equation for real and imaginary\npart of \u03c8\n\u03d5\u03071 = H 2\u03d51 \u2212H 1\u03d52 (2)\n\u03d5\u03072 = H 1\u03d51 +H 2\u03d52, (3)\nwhere H 1=Re(H ) and H 2=Im(H ), also the dots notations refers to time derivative. A standard decoupling procedure follows from the procedure of deriving again both expressions gets the equations\n\u03d5\u03081 = H 2 \u03d5\u03071 \u2212H 1 \u03d5\u03072 (4)\n\u03d5\u03082 = H 1 \u03d5\u03071 +H 2 \u03d5\u03072, (5)\nclearing \u03d5\u03072 from (3) and \u03d52 form (2) and replace them in expression (4) and the speculate proceeding solving \u03d5\u03071 from (2) and\u03d51 form (3) and replace them in expression (5), we obtain\n\u03d5\u0308l(t) +Aq \u03d5\u0307l(t) +Bq\u03d5l(t) = 0, (6)\nvalid for l = 1, 2. It is clear that even if both the real and imaginary part of \u03c8 verify the same equation, one cannot leave out one of them, because the solution of (6) implies the knowledge of the initial conditions. The real matrices Aq and Bq depends on (H 1,H 2) [4] as follows\nAq = \u2212H 2 \u2212H 1H 2H \u22121 1 Bq =H 2 1 +H 1H 2H \u22121 1 H 2.\n(7)\nthe sub index q refers to the fact that such matrices (Aq,Bq) encode the hamiltonian of the quantum system.\nLet us now go to a classical system. We start with a system of linear differential equations of second order, entirely similar to (6)\nq\u0308(t) +A q\u0307(t) +B q(t) = 0 (8)\nwith (q1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, qk, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, qn) t=q \u2208 Rn are the generalized coordinates, and A,B\u2208Mn\u00d7n(R), by\ndefinition. Following [3, 4] the equation (8) can be performed through a classical electric network. We are particularly interested in lumped element model circuits where voltage and current depend only upon time."

            "text": "An electrical network is understood as the composition of an oriented graph, where each of its arcs has two associated functions of time: current and voltage, these functions are linked by Kirchhoff\u2019s laws and by the arc relations that arise from the graph that represents it and the interconnected electrical elements, e.g. resistors, inductors, capacitors, etc. [9].\nWhenever the method of nodes, loops or pairs of nodes [9, 10] is used to find the dynamics of the network, systems of linear differential equations of second order or integrodifferential equations will be obtained. To be able to use these methods, it is necessary to know the electrical network entirety, i.e. the elements that compose it and their arrangement and interconnection. Since we do not have this information, the solution must be structured on a general circuit, i.e. without taking into account its graph, or the elements in each of its arcs. Therefore it is not possible to apply any of the network analysis methods until we find a particular network and its arc elements. The way to solve this apparent circular problem requires not the analysis of one circuit, but the synthesis of all circuits in a given preferential family. Such requirements can be fixed from other assumptions which we\nwill see below.\nWe intend to distinguish or identify generalized coordinates in the electrical network such that the equations (8) are satisfied. Since that equation has n degrees of freedom, we therefore distinguish n local regions in the network from which voltages or currents can be measured. These regions are called ports: a pairs of terminals that allow to exchange energy with the surrounding and have a given port-voltage and port-current. We conclude such an electrical network has n independent ports perfectly identified.\nThe general structure that we propose is an electrical network composed of n dipoles listed as {Nk}k\u2208In , also called one\u2212port networks, interconnected through a n\u2212port interaction network N [9, 12]. We see that each of one\u2212port network introduces a port\u2212voltage or port\u2212current, that will be corresponds to a generalized coordinate, qk from q in (8), see figure 1. Since H is time\u2212independent, then the matrices Aq and Bq inherit this property. Therefore, the dynamics of the power grid must be invariant under time translations, this implies that it does not contain internal generators. The initial conditions will be given on each dipole only, so the energy initially contained by the interaction network N will be zero. In this way the theory of multi\u2212port networks can be perfectly used to synthesized N , regardless of the graph that represents it and the elements it contains [9, 10].\nIn this scenario is possible to define a transfer matrix function of N written as the quotient between of the Laplace transformation to certain output signals and the Laplace transformation of certain input signals. Depend-\ning on which signals are considered as inputs and outputs there are four general representations: transmission, impedance, admittance, or hybrid. Note that the last case of a hybrid representations of N is ruled out, otherwise the input and output signals, voltages and currents, from different ports would be mixed, thus losing the possibility that each networks {Nk}k\u2208In represents, per se, one and only one of the coordinates of the quantum system described in a given basis. In conclusion we have interested in transmission, impedance or admittance representation of the n\u2212port network N , which is also a passive network, i.e. the energy provided by an external source is non negative. As we have pointed out the energy is initially provided by the list of one\u2212port networks {Nk}k\u2208In .\nThe corresponding dynamics of an electric network is defined by the appropriate use of the Kirchhoff rules that take care of the topology of the network, schematically represented in figure 1.\nWe have said that the generalized coordinates will be port\u2212voltages or port\u2212current of each of the n networks of the list {Nk}k\u2208In . Therefore, the n\u2212port network N acts as an interaction in the sense that it physically interconnects the n dipoles networks. So the non-interaction case corresponds to disconnecting the network N . In quantum mechanics, this interaction-free, discarding the trivial case H=0, corresponds to a diagonal hamiltonian H=diag(\u03bb1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, \u03bbn), so that each coordinate from (1) is given by \u03c8k=\u03b1ke \u2212it\u03bbk , for a given \u03b1k\u2208C. Given that H is hermitian, this solution corresponds to harmonic pure oscillations and its eigenvalue \u03bbk is the unique natu-\nral frequency of the coordinate \u03c8k. In the classical circuit, this implies that each one\u2212port network must be non-dissipative. The reactance theorem, initially developed by Foster, subsequently by Brune [13, 14] and generalized by Cauer [15], consolidates a synthesis method for lossless networks. We conclude that its transfer function, in Laplace complex variable s, has a single pole in the complex plane, specifically on the imaginary axis and its complex conjugate, because the transfer function is a positive\u2212real function [13\u201315]. This implies two kind of circuits for each dipole, represented in figure 2. The chosen dynamical quantity is chosen as the common variable to all these elements, Lk and Ck, are voltages for the parallel case and current for the series case, represented in up and down part of figure 2 respectively.\nThe pair of nodes (ak, bk) must be available to connect N , in the interaction case, however\nare useful, at this time, to remember that vk is the potential difference between ak and bk (ik is the current through ak and bk) at up (down) case of figure 2. The voltage source vk(0) (the current source ik(0)) in figure 2 represent not only the initial condition but also mention that the initial energy is stored in the reactive elements. From an electromagnetic point of view, the initial potential difference in the capacitor Ck refers to the stored electrical energy given by 12Ckv 2 k(0). While the initial current in the inductor Lk refers to the stored magnetic energy given by 12Lki 2 k(0). That is, both reactive elements are the initial source and thus provide the initial condition in each case.\nAn alternative way to see this conclusion directly and independently of the synthesis method employed corresponds to take the decomplexification of (1). The non\u2212interacting case corresponds to H is diagonal, and from the hermiticity ofH this is also real. Then the matrices Aq and Bq from (7) take the particular form Aq=0 and Bq=diag(\u03bb 2 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, \u03bb 2 n), and the equation (6) is reduced to \u03d5\u0308l +B\u03d5l = 0, which corresponds to a classical system whose behavior must respond to harmonic oscillator without damping. In order to compare directly with the result from the network synthesis method, let\u2019s apply the Laplace transform (L) of the above linear differential equation and taken the k component of \u03d5l(t), denoted by x(t), then X(s)=[s x(0) + x\u0307(0)]/(s2 + \u03bb2k), where X(s)=L(x(t))(s). We see that X(s) has only two complex conjugates poles on the imaginary axis, \u00b1i\u03bbk. The values of the inductance and capacitance of each network Nk can be fixed in order to satisfy \u03bb2k=(LkCk) \u22121.\nIn summary, interaction-free corresponds to oscillation-free behavior without energy dissipation. The procedure continues to the injection of the signal vk (or ik) as port-voltage (or port-current) of the interaction network. In this way the subnetworks {Nk}k\u2208In of the figure 3 are ready to be connected to each port of N . Alternatives (dual) topologies for each dipole subnetwork Nk for the interaction case. The pair terminal (ak, bk) preparation of each dipole requieres that the line between ak and bk in the second (down) case of figure 2 must be opened. For each pair (ak, bk) must be connected to the k\u2212port of N , in order to reproduce the interaction.\nTo fix ideas we choose port\u2212voltages of\neach network of the list {Nk}k\u2208In as generalized coordinates, named v=(v1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, vk, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, vn), the upper figure 2. The analysis provided in [3] of the time evolution of electric circuits can be generalized here and results in a system of linear differential equations as (8).\nFrom Kirchhoff\u2019s first law at the k\u2212node of figure 3 one has ik(t)+iLk(t)+ick(t)=0 where Lk and Ck are the mentioned tandem of the network Nk. Given that the current-voltage relationship for the inductor Lk is vk(t)=LkdtiLk (t), we obtain iLk(t)=iLk(\u01eb)+ 1\nLk\n\u222b t \u01eb vk(u) du, for \u01eb<0 and |\u01eb|\nsmall, with the causality condition for the inductor current iLj (t)=0, \u2200t < 0, we have\nik(t) + Ckv\u0307k(t)+ 1\nLk \u222b t \u01eb vk(u) du = 0. (9)\nPerforming a Laplace transform (L) on (9) and using the causality condition for k\u2212port voltage vk, thus\nIk(s)+Cks Vk(s)\u2212Ckvk(0)+ 1\nLks Vk(s) = 0.\n(10)\nNote that the causality condition on vk is expressed here in L[ \u222b t\n\u01eb vk(u)du](s)=s \u22121 Vk(s)\nbecause vk(t) = 0, \u2200t < 0. The equation (10) can be expressed in vector form as\nsV (s)\u2212v(0)+s\u22121\u03c920 V (s)+C \u22121Y (s)V (s) = 0\n(11)\nwhere C and L are diagonal matrices which contain the capacitors and inductors of the one\u2212port networks of the list {Nk}k=1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,n, C=diag(C1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, Cn) and L=diag(L1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, Ln). In this way, \u03c920 = (LC ) \u22121 contains the proper frequencies of each Lk\u2016Ck port tandem of the figure 2. In addition, we have used the transfer relation coming from the interaction network N : I (s) = Y (s)V (s). Applying the inverse Laplace transform (L\u22121) on (11) to obtain the equation in the time domain\nv\u0307(t)+\u03c920 \u222b t 0 v(u)du+C\u22121L\u22121[Y (s)V (s)](t)=0,\n(12)\nand we derive it with respect to t to take it to a differential equation of second order\nv\u0308(t) +\u03c920 v(t) +C \u22121dt{L \u22121[Y (s)V (s)](t)}=0.\n(13)\nThe matrix elements of Y (s) are rational functions: quotients of polynomials in s. A necessary and sufficient condition for that the equation (13) has the form of (8) is\nY (s) = \u03b1+ 1\ns \u03b2 (14)\nwhere the constant matrix \u03b1 and \u03b2 can be synthesized using the general method exposed in [11, 12]. Finally, the matrices (A,B) of (8) are written in terms of admittance matrices (\u03b1,\u03b2) of the interaction network N and (L,C) from k\u2212tandem Lk\u2016Ck circuit, which constitutes the subnetwork Nk showed in figure 3, as\nA = C\u22121\u03b1, B = C\u22121(L\u22121+\u03b2). (15)\nUsing the synthesis methods [9\u201312] on the general topology proposed in figure 1, it is possible to obtain an interaction network N whose admittance matrices define two matrices (A,B) from (15) that are identical to (Aq,Bq) from (7). In other words these classical matrices can be mapped to the quantum hamiltonian. In other words, H is codified in terms of A and B , in particular in \u03b1 and \u03b2 of the synthesis of the interaction network N .\nA similar procedure can be repeated using the impedance representation of the network N , simply by interchanging the following quantities: voltages by currents, inductances by capacitances, conductances by resistances in order to obtain identical equations to (8) so that now the generalized coordinates are the port\u2212currents i. Note that this alternative not only gives us a plan B in the implementation but also both implementations could be done simultaneously, so that the port\u2212voltages of one and the port\u2212currents of the other are represents exactly the real and imaginary part of the wave function Re(\u03c8) \u223c v and Im(\u03c8) \u223c i [4]. A concrete construction of such circuits with their corresponding experimental measurements can be found in [4]. In general, the proposed configuration in the figure 1 each port voltage vk works as the real, or imaginary, part of the k\u2212component of the wave function \u03c8."

In others words, we must perform a casting call of quantum systems or actors which can be very limited, because it is a hard task to find another Q one to simulate Q\u2032. Note that this mapping \u2126\u03c9(H ):=\u03c9H\u03c9 \u22121 + i \u03c9\u0307.\u03c9\u22121 is a generalization on a simple similarity transformation [2]. Making use of the fact that all these quantum systems are equivalent via a mapping \u2126\u03c9 , from a given H to any other hamiltonian H \u2032 [1], a route by which it is possible to implement the simulation of quantum systems via classical circuits is well defined.\nFollowing the metaphor, the simulation showed here allows to expands that catalogue of actors that can make a good performance in order to mimic a quantum system and becoming that casting call, a priori, much simpler.\nGiven a quantum system Q over a Hilbert space of finite dimension n, there is a general topology, as shown in figure 1, of n\u2212subnetworks {Nk}k=1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,n connected to an interaction network N of n\u2212ports. Such a network N can be adequately synthesized in such a way that the voltages (or currents) of each of its ports evolves in time in the same way as the\nreal (imaginary) part of the original quantum system. In other words, the time evolution of such a quantum system can be analogically simulated from a classical tuned circuit.\nA final comment in this regard could be the implementation of the formal equivalence between quantum and classical systems proposed in [4] in order to simulate quantum systems through specific circuits. The advantage of using such classical systems is that their controllability can be implemented today, in order to adequately guide its temporal evolution. This implementation open the possibility to expands this catalogue of actors capable of simulating the quantum system Q even more with classical actors, who usually do not play that role. We are convinced that this work enriches the field of quantum simulations."
