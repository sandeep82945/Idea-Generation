Kevin Lu2*\u2020, Xiaomo Xiong2, Tai-Ying Lee2, Huang Huang3 and Bin Jiang4*\u2020\n1Department of Clinical Pharmacy & Pharmacy Administration, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, 2University of South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Columbia, SC, United States, 3Department of Public Policy, School of Government, Peking University, Beijing, China, 4Department of Pharmacy Administration & Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China\nIntroduction: Although persistent inhibition of HBV replication by antiviral therapy has shown to slow disease progression, cost-related access barriers to these essential medicines are becoming salient. The national volume-based procurement (NVBP) was piloted in China and led to substantial reduction in the list price of prescription drugs. To examine the impact of NVBP on selected antiviral medication costs per defined daily dose (DDD), procurement volumes, and spending.\nMethods:We employed an interrupted time series design to examine changes in cost per defined daily dose (DDD), procurement volumes, and spending for NVBP bid-winning antiviral medications (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and entecavir) in 11 pilot cities from 2017 to 2020. Procurement transaction data were obtained from 9,454 hospitals in the Chinese Hospital Pharmaceutical Audit (CHPA) database. In the secondary analysis, the control group comprised two non-NVBP drugs (adefovir and lamivudine) procured in 11 cities not exposed to the NVBP.\nResults: Cost per DDD of the two hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral medications reduced by CNY1.598 (p = 0.002) immediately following the implementation of NVBP, dropping from an average cost of CNY16.483 per DDD at baseline to CNY6.420 at the end of the observation period. NVBP implementation resulted in a substantial reduction in daily costs of antivirals and an increase in monthly procurement volumes by 6.674 million DDDs (p = 0.017), while monthly spending was reduced by CNY138.26 million (p = 0.002). In the secondary ITS analysis with a control group, the average cost per DDD of the NVBP bidwinning antivirals declined by CNY4.537 (p < 0.001), monthly procurement volumes increased by 7.209 million DDDs (p = 0.002), and monthly spending dropped by CNY138.83 million (p < 0.001).\nConclusion: Volume-based procurement piloted in China may be effective for reducing price and total expenditures and improving drug utilization, which is especially important for HBV patients who need constant access to antiviral therapies.\nKeywords: NVBP, HBV, affordability, procurement, access to care, ITS\nEdited by: Tanveer Ahmed Khan,\nNational Institute of Health, Pakistan\nReviewed by: Angela Acosta,\nICESI University, Colombia Ying Yang,\nWuhan University, China\n*Correspondence: Z.

            "text": "Aimed at reducing global HBV incidence by 90% and mortality by 65%, the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals have set ambitious targets, projecting these to be achieved by 2030 (McNaughton et al., 2021). Generally, effective vaccines and supportive care are recommended for preventing and managing of Hepatitis B. As complete eradication of HBV cannot be achieved by modern HBV therapy, people with HBV may need to depend on their medications for the rest of their lives (Vlachogiannakos and Papatheodoridis, 2018). Persistent inhibition of HBV replication by antiviral therapy has been shown to be able to prevent chronic HBV-induced progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC (Lampertico et al., 2015; Papatheodoridis et al., 2015), achieving the ultimate goal of improved survival and quality of life for most HBV patients (Vlachogiannakos and Papatheodoridis, 2018). Through wider use of antiviral therapy and expansion of HBV treatment eligibility, potential public health benefits in reducing transmission may be achieved as suggested by McNaughton AL and colleagues (McNaughton et al., 2021). However, antiviral therapy can be costly, resulting in increased economic burden and limited access to such essential medications. In low-to-middleincome countries (LMICs) such as China, where access to medicines is largely influenced by the drug price, this can become an issue.\nAs one of the most important measures of China\u2019s health care system reform and universal health coverage program, the national volume-based procurement (NVBP) was implemented in December 2018. Specifically, the NVBP is a novel pooled procurement for negotiating drug prices with manufacturers by using collective bargaining power, and was piloted in the \u201c4+7\u201d cities, comprising four municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing) and seven key cities in other provinces (Xi\u2019an, Dalian, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenzhen, and Xiamen) (Yuan et al., 2021). The NVBP is administrated by the Joint Procurement Office (JPO), which is a coalition of representatives from local drug procurement agencies established under the State Council. The NVBP has taken several steps to reduce prices and increase the affordability of higher quality medicines, including ensuring bioequivalence and therapeutic efficacy of generic drugs, achieving volume-price linkage to improve negotiation power, promoting drug supply chain efficiency, encouraging generic substitution and rational use of medication, and reducing capital and marketing costs. (Yuan et al., 2021).\nNVBP primarily aims to lower drug prices while maintaining the supply of pharmaceuticals, and substantial cuts in drug prices have been reported upon its implementation (Tang et al., 2019; Yue, 2019). Increased procurement prices were attributed to the \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d principle applied in procurement (Jiang et al., 2020). Furthermore, based on the data on previous pharmaceutical reforms in China, the effects of lowering prescription drug prices might become insignificant in the long run (He et al., 2018). A number of studies have found that the implementation of the NVBP was associated with overall decreased drug prices and expenditures, along with an increased overall quality level of drug use (Chen et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). A previous study by our team also found that the implementation of the NVBP improved the affordability of the drugs procured (Yuan et al., 2021). In addition, several studies have also assessed the effect of NVBP on some specialized drugs, including antibiotics, antihypertensive drugs, and nucleic acid drugs. These studies found that the NVBP might have a positive effect on different types of drugs (Yang et al., 2021a; Yang et al., 2021b; Wen et al., 2021). However, the study on the nucleos(t)ide analogs only included the data in one of the pilot cities of the NVBP for a relatively short period of time (Wen et al., 2021). Hence, the impact of NVBP on drug prices, total expenditures, and utilization of antiviral therapy in all seven pilot cities over a longer period of time remains unclear.\nTo better understand the impact of NVBP, this study aimed to examine the policy\u2019s impact on selected antiviral medication costs per defined daily dose (DDD), procurement volumes, and spending. Two antiviral medications, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and entecavir, were included in the NVBP. TDF is mainly indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in combination with other antiretroviral agents, but it is mainly used for patients with HBV, given the extremely low prevalence of HIV in China11. It was estimated that the prevalence of HIV was approximately 0.5% in a high-risk population in China (Zhang et al., 2013).\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8429442"

As part of the pharmaceutical reform, the NVBP pilot program was launched in March 2019 in \u201c4+7\u201d cities. Procurement included originators or generics passing the generic consistency evaluation (GCE). A total of 25 drugs won the bidding in the \u201c4+7\u201d pilot program, including two HBV antivirals (TDF and entecavir). A careful evaluation of the \u201c4+7\u201d piloted policy showed that NVBP expanded to the remaining provinces of the nation in December 2019. The elements of the NVBP include ensuring bioequivalence and therapeutic efficacy of generic drugs, achieving volume-price linkage to improve negotiation power, promoting drug supply chain efficiency, encouraging generic substitution and rational use of medication, and reducing capital and marketing costs. The implementation details of each element can be found in our previously published article (Yuan et al., 2021)."

CHPA provides a national estimate based on drug purchase data of 9,454 hospitals sampled from all hospitals with over 100 beds in four municipalities, 27 provinces, and 255 major and countylevel cities in China. According to the 2020 Statistical Bulletin on the Development of China\u2019s Health and Wellness, the number of hospitals with \u2265100 beds was 14,148 at the end of 2020, indicating that the coverage rate of the hospitals with (\u2265100 beds) in the CHPA might be more than half (Commission, 2020). As antivirals are specialty prescription drugs in China, most HBV patients fill their prescriptions in hospital pharmacies rather than in community pharmacies. We extracted monthly aggregated purchases of antivirals with detailed information on generic name, brand name, the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code, manufacturer, strength, package specification, total volumes, and costs of purchase. (Diao et al., 2019). Additionally, a standardized dosing unit was defined by CHPA. Only data from the public hospital were included in the analysis as NVBP was implemented exclusively in public hospitals."

The implementation of the NVBP in 11 pilot cities was the intervention for this study. Specifically, initial procurement of two antivirals (TDF and entecavir) was implemented between March and April 2019, and NVBP was expanded between November and December 2019. Therefore, the 43-months time series was divided into three segments; the pre-\nNVBP period was defined as the time period between January 2017 and March 2019, the \u201c4+7\u201d pilot period was between April and November 2019, and the expansion period was between December 2019 and September 2020. ITS analysis, one of the strongest quasi-experimental designs, is commonly used to determine whether a new program or policy is associated with specific outcomes. This is particularly useful when conducting a randomized clinical trial. By collecting multiple time points before and after intervention, detecting an underlying secular trend in the pre- and post-intervention phases is possible. This study followed the methodological and reporting guidelines for interrupted time-series analyses proposed by (Jandoc et al., 2015)."

Cost per DDD was used as a surrogate measure for unit price paid by public hospitals. Cost per DDD was calculated for each of the antivirals by dividing procurement spending and the volume of a given drug. As the actual daily dose may vary between patients over time, DDD, defined as the assumed average maintenance daily dose for a drug used for adults, was used as a proxy for daily dose (Organization, 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). DDDs were obtained from the ATC Index published by theWorld Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHO, 2021). Procurement volumes comprised the total monthly DDDs for each antiviral of interest. Procurement spending was calculated to reflect the expenditures paid by hospitals."

            "text": "In this study, we assessed the impact of NVBP on the utilization and expenditure of antiviral agents used for HBV infection. Our findings fulfilled the hypothesis that NVBP decreased the daily spending (or price) of antivirals, increasing the utilization (or demand) of medication treatment. Considering substantial price cuts for both TDF and entecavir, a drastic decrease in the total\nexpenditures can be observed. This suggests the potential effect of NVBP on controlling total expenditures while improving affordability and patient access to previously costly antiviral agents.\nOur findings are consistent with previous studies. Wen et al. found that in Shenzhen, the NVBP pilot program was associated with reduced DDDs and improved accessibility of nucleos(t)ide analogs. (Wen et al., 2021). Our study further investigated the impact of the NVBP on antiviral drugs in all pilot cities with a longer period of study time. We found that the NVBP extension also had a positive effect. Wang et al. found that the NVBP is conducive to generic substitution. There is a similar effect in our study. (Wang et al., 2021). As the generic version of TDF was approved in 2017, we observed gradually expanded utilization of TDF over time. For adefovir and lamivudine (two drugs not included in the NVBP), the utilization remained stable, suggesting a significant effect of NVBP on increasing antiviral therapy for HBV patients. In addition, some studies have found that NVBP had a positive effect on antihypertensive and antibiotics. (Yang et al., 2021a; Yang et al., 2021b). However, there is no relevant research on the differences in the effects for different types of drugs, which may require more follow-up research.\nNVBP explored the potential ways to reduce high drug prices, which is one of the greatest global public health issues faced by\nFIGURE 2 | The observed and predicted (A) cost per DDD (B) procurement volume (C) procurement spending from secondary ITS analysis with a control group*. * The predicted values were obtained from ITS with a control groups, the intervention group included TDF and entecavir procured in \"4+7\u201d cities; control group included adefovir and lamivudine procured in control cities.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8429447\nmany nations.

Using NVBP as an innovative strategy for drug price regulation, bid-winning drugs\u2014specifically TDF\u2014demonstrated its favorable profiles by exhibiting 94% price cuts and significant change in the total expenditures on TDF by 8.8 times from 1.506 million on 2017 Q1 to 13.148 million on 2020 Q3. As the generic version of TDF was approved in 2017, we observed gradually expanded utilization of TDF over time. For adefovir and lamivudine (two drugs not included in the NVBP), the utilization remained stable, suggesting a significant effect of NVBP on increasing antiviral therapy for HBV patients. Additionally, the prices for brandname drugs also decreased slightly. This might be explained by increased competition in the drug market for antiviral therapy, where unselected antiviral drugs are actively lowering their prices, ultimately expanding patient access to more treatment options.\nPrice negotiations with manufacturers based on volume purchases have long been considered effective at reducing drug prices (Gaffney and Lexchin, 2018). For instance, a price cut of generic drugs has been achieved through the Partnership for Supply Chain Management (PFSCM), which provided procurement services to the United States government (Tren et al., 2009; van Valen et al., 2018). Another example of NVBP was found in Italy, where an immense budgetary concern among patients needing sofosbuvir was addressed by introducing nationwide budget thresholds and price-volume agreements. Consequently, reduced prices and expanded access to treatment by more patients were achieved (Messori, 2016).\nAntiviral medications are essential for the successful treatment of hepatitis. Implementing NVBP may help reduce disease transmission and achieve UN goals (McNaughton et al., 2021). Individuals with HBV may experience both personal and societal impacts, including anxiety, financial burden and instability, discrimination, and stigma (Tu et al., 2020). Timely access to antiviral therapy is key in regulating disease progression and improving quality of life, while current therapies are expensive and generally require life-long treatment (Vedio et al., 2017; Alter et al., 2018; Revill et al., 2019). In low-tomiddle-income countries (LMIC) with high prevalence of HBsAg, the main challenges are the availability and cost of antiviral therapy (Subic and Zoulim, 2018). Improving access to this essential therapy for a large population is a complex public health challenge requiring multilateral collaborations among pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, and healthcare providers. The novel implementation of NVBP in China demonstrated its effectivity in streamlining access to essential medicines for vulnerable populations. Most recently, healthcare systems have been moving toward services emphasizing value-based purchasing and patient-centered care (Chee et al., 2016). Similarly, future procurement in China should consider the value of healthcare products. Clinicians and patients should actively engage in the procurement process to maximize optimal outcomes, achieve shared goals, and make informed decisions\naccording to the value of the drugs (VanLare and Conway, 2012).\nAs part of the health care reforms implemented in China in recent years, NVBP has demonstrated its role in promoting the rationality of medical use. At present, the expansion of NVBP is still in progress, and its effect may also help more patients to improve their health equity and quality of life. In any case, most of the pilot cities of NVBP are economically developed cities, and how implementing the policy in remote or rural areas still needs a lot of effort. At the same time, in these remote places, it is unknown whether the effect will be as same as the effect in metropolitan areas. In addition, the types of drugs included in NVBP are still limited, and how to expand the policy to more drugs also needs to be considered. In drug price negotiations, pharmacoeconomics may play a supporting role. The cost-effectiveness analysis for the drug itself and the budget impact analysis for insurance funding can both play their roles and help determine the negotiated price more rationally and scientifically.\nOur study bears several strengths. First, we employed big data from 9,454 hospitals nationwide and interrupted time series studies. These have helped us substantially in understanding the price change of antiviral treatment for HBV as drug pricing is not transparent in China before NVBP. Additionally, this is also the first study to evaluate changes in the utilization of hepatitis medications before and after the implementation of NVBP. However, our study contains several limitations. First, the data collected in this study may not be generalizable to some developed countries using value-based purchasing in their respective health systems and may not reflect the most desirable measures that will be adopted by providers in various institutions. Besides, private hospitals and retail pharmacies were encouraged to participate but not mandatory for the NVBP. However, private hospital beds account for about a quarter of China\u2019s total (Commission, 2020), therefor, future studies needs to investigate the effect of the NVBP on private hospitals, especially comparing those with or without the NVBP. Additionally, our data cannot be used to make inferences about individual-level outcomes as patient factors; responses to therapy may vary. Third, even though we chose control cities with similar social and economic characteristics, huge differences in procurement volumes and spending between pilot and control cities were found. Also, the secular change might have an effect on the results. In any case, the control cities with regression method could minimize the bias caused by the other factors. Fourth, NVBP programs are not adequately developed and designed to encompass all patent hepatitis medications requiring price reduction, better affordability, and easy access for patients (Penfold and Zhang, 2013). Future researchers should increase focus on the transitions from volume-based to value-based models in China. Nevertheless, the implementation and application of such measures could profoundly influence drug price, expenditure, utilization, and access to antiviral therapy in China (Daub et al., 2020).\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8429448"
