    "abstractText": "This study aims to determine the factors influencing interpersonal communication of Buddhist College students, in the online learning process during the covid-19 pandemic, and (2) know the indicators that affect the student's interpersonal communication factors. This study uses a mixed-method. Qualitative methods are used to describe the data descriptively, while quantitative methods are used in factor analysis. Respectively, the most influential factor on interpersonal communication is the motivation in communicating in the academic field, with a score of 0.81, followed by self-confidence with a score of 0.67, and lastly, openness, with a score of 0.67. Each factor is composed of four indicators as follows. For example, confidence is composed of belief, a sense of responsibility, objectivity, and rationality. The strongest indicator of the self-confidence factor is the belief in one's abilities. Meanwhile, achievement motivation factors are mostly composed of such indicators as a willingness to learn, adaptability, the desire to excel, and the existence of communication efforts. The indicator of the strongest motivational factors is achievement motivation. In addition, the openness factor is composed of indicators of equality, environmental interaction, mutual trust, and values. The strongest indicator of the openness factor is the value of interpersonal communication, especially in online learning processes.",

            "text": "Developments and changes in today\u2019s environment, as severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, impacted several life aspects including the socio-economic community. Many people have lost their jobs as their main income. Their psychological-social life experiences a lot of disturbances, worry, and anxiety as the result of the covid-19 pandemic which provides uncertainty in people's lives. This, also, has a huge impact on the educational process. For example, because of online learning processes, there are new demands that previously did not even exist, which become new problems, such as the increasing need for an internet network and its supporting equipment. Before the pandemic everything could be fulfilled more simply, yet, todays\u2019 changes emerge as the new utilities needed to support the learning process, especially within the family members.\nE-ISSN 2240-0524 ISSN 2239-978X\nJournal of Educational and Social Research www.richtmann.org\nVol 12 No 1 January 2022\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has changed all aspects of education, including higher education. Fundamental changes occurred specifically in the process of student-teacher meetings. The previous face-to-face teaching and learning process has changed to the online learning process (AlmonacidFierro et al., 2021), (Pavan Kumar, 2021). The changes require all stakeholders to adapt to the situation by making the learning process sufficiently conducted through media and information technology (Bismala & Manurung, 2021), (Saripudin et al., 2020). The process of adaptation in the learning process in the pandemic era will also have an impact on less-effective academic affairs, or even the possibility of misunderstandings in academic contexts. This is also known as academic anxiety. This anxiety can arise due to conditions caused by feelings of excessive anxiety as the result of various academic tasks (Anugrah et al., 2021). During the learning process in the covid-19 pandemic, there are obstacles found to affect the continuity and sustainability of the learning process. For example, the online learning process may create new challenges emerging from the family environment, students, infrastructure, and educators (Wahyono et al., 2020). The learning process at the higher education level with its learning model and independence makes it important to do an in-depth study, how its sustainability can be effective and efficient. It is also necessary to see how the role of the students and lecturers in maintaining and creating a better learning atmosphere, or how to communicate well. The management of higher education needs to pay attention to the potential of students, considered as the millennial students, as they are the generation born in the digital era. This is in line with the pandemic condition, which requires all stakeholders to do everything online. In one part of online or virtual learning, through well-guided steps, it can help students to increase their earning motivation, as stated by Menon (Shanmugam & Balakrishnan, 2019). The current generation, known as Generation Z relies heavily on the state of technology (Samala et al., 2020), (Hadion Wijoyo et al., 2020). Many exemplified how this generation uses online media, showing that they are very attached to smartphones or online media (Firamadhina & Krisnani, 2021). The learning process for the gen-Z has special characteristics to consider, including the aforementioned criteria, in which this generation tends to use online media especially those providing entertainment content, such as Instagram, You tube, and Tik Tok. It should also be understood that the amount of time they spent accessing the videos is relatively shorter than that of the previous generation (Hadion Wijoyo et al., 2020). Based on these characteristics, it is also necessary to pay attention to how to use learning media in the online learning process appropriately (Sadtyadi, 2021). Thus, it indicates the complexity of the problems in online learning does exist, especially on how to maintain good communication, to be in line with the real situation. In addition to these problems, another thing to consider is the family background, for example, students are living in areas where the internet is accessible, while others are living in areas where the internet is not accessible (Basar, 2021). Regional or geographical differences can also create disparities in the internet service quality, requiring students to make various adjustments during the learning process, such as looking for places or locations with good internet reception. Looking for appropriate internet access coverage to ensure maximize the learning process is an important part to consider. Problems related to a location with internet coverage are factors that cannot normally be identified by the lecturers. However, to ensure that the student-lecture communication can take place properly, those problems do need to be aware of. Internet service interference can be a main problem in the online learning process, not to mention the problems in readiness of the students or the lecturers to take part in the online learning process (Hidayat et al., 2020). Meanwhile, other additional problems may occur, such as the socioeconomic conditions of the students, especially in providing facilities to support the learning process. While most students may have sufficient equipment to support the learning process like mobile phones (Android), other unfortunate students will still find it difficult to purchase laptops or notebooks. This shows that the students need motivation (Agustina & Kurniawan, 2020) or support to keep them enthusiastic to follow online learning despite the insufficient facilities. It is expected that the students can communicate anything related to their problems, can adapt to the online\nE-ISSN 2240-0524 ISSN 2239-978X\nJournal of Educational and Social Research www.richtmann.org\nVol 12 No 1 January 2022\nlearning process, and be effortful during the online learning process. The implementation of the learning process relies heavily on two-way communication, between the students and the lecturer. Communication is a connecting part to accept as well as to find solutions for online learning problems that may exist especially during the covid-19 pandemic. Students, as learners, play a role in preparing themselves to follow the learning and evaluation processes held by the institution. In addition, the interpersonal communication of the students in academic activities will have an impact on students\u2019 achievement (Abubakar, 2015), (DeVito, 2013). Interpersonal communication becomes an important part and foundation in achieving the success of the learning process. Through good communication, it will be easy to understand the materials being taught by the lecturers and to do the assignments from the lecturer. Siburian (Ramadanty & Martinus, 2016) stated that effective interpersonal communication, good academic culture, and high achievement motivation will take part in improving students\u2019 interpersonal communication. In terms of students\u2019 communication in the learning process, it is related to the commitment of the students themselves as internal support to maintain the quality learning process to produce successful learning. The commitment that arises from the students, as part of the attitude shows how the students are related to the institution or faculty members. The students\u2019 commitment is expected to be a developing and sustainable support system to help the students achieve their learning success. The importance of open communication and honesty is important part of today's learning process. Problems that occur in the learning process must be communicated, to prevent a bigger impact on the stakeholders. The lecturers, as the educators, must be able to see facts as well as to find the underlying motivation of the students in participating in the learning process. The existence of an academic culture that takes place in the era of the covid-19 pandemic must also ensure the continuity of good communication. As the result, it is necessary to reveal the factors that affect the interpersonal communication of Buddhist College students, in the online learning process, especially during the covid-19 pandemic. Also, it is no less important to find the indicators that affect the student's interpersonal communication factors."

Communication is part of behavior in carrying out academic actions (Abubakar, 2015), (Gabatino & Afalla, 2021) to be able to establish a conducive academic culture. The communication process among students and lecturers or faculty members within the educational environment is an important and influential part of establishing a harmonious atmosphere in the learning process. In the process of communication, as shown by the language classes, there are several overviews of how communication in the classroom happens, such as, Lee and Hsieh (Mulyono & Saskia, 2021), who provided an overview of the confidence factor as one of the strong variables that influence communication. Meanwhile, Khajavy et al. (Mulyono & Saskia, 2021), showed variables that play an important role in communication in the learning process, such as selfconfidence, motivation, and anxiety in delivery. MacIntyre, (Weda et al., 2021), regarding the communication model (WTC) states that there are layers related to the model of communication willingness. The first layer is the behavior in communicating, or, the intention to communicate, the second layer is the desire or willingness to communicate, and the third layer is the motivational, affective and cognitive context, or, the individual's social context. Interpersonal communication is the process of delivering information to others either directly or indirectly (Barseli et al., 2019), (Gunawati et al., 2006), (Pearson et al., 2011) Some of the most important interpersonal communication skills are demonstrated by the following factors: attention, cultural sensitivity, focus, openness, metacommunication, or the ability to talk about conversation, togetherness, flexibility, expressiveness, empathy, supportiveness, equality and interaction\nE-ISSN 2240-0524 ISSN 2239-978X\nJournal of Educational and Social Research www.richtmann.org\nVol 12 No 1 January 2022\nmanagement (DeVito, 2013). Interpersonal communication for students is very important especially in the pursuit of academic success. At the same time, interpersonal communication affects student success, in which through interpersonal communication, students\u2019 efforts to fulfill assignments can be more effective (Oktary et al., 2019). Furthermore, in this case, interpersonal communication is influenced by self-confidence, achievement motivation, and openness. Self-confidence is an important part of interpersonal communication (DeVito, 2013). Confidence in communicating is a sense of confidence in the form of the ability to convey messages clearly without interference. In his opinion, Wilis states that self-confidence is a person's belief in solving problems and ability to create pleasant conditions (Anggeraini & Farozin, 2019). Confidence can be influenced by the level of confidence in abilities, responsibility, objective, rationality, and realism (Sari, 2018). Interpersonal communication can also be encouraged as the basis of motivation. Motivation is a personal feeling or situation as a driving force that comes from within a person (Akomolafe et al., 2013)(Shaleh, 2016). Motivation may vary among individuals. Also, motivation in the learning process is more about the motivation regarding the interaction between the teachers and students, (Shanmugam & Balakrishnan, 2019)(Wichanpricha, 2021), or in a college situation and context, between lecturers and students in their learning environment. Furthermore, motivation is the foundation to achieve certain goals. In the learning process, the media can be a part of intrinsic motivation (Navarro et al., 2020). Also, the use of IT equipment can be another supporting part in improving students\u2019 competence. In the learning process, achievement motivation becomes an important part more specifically in terms of encouraging the students in the learning process during the covid-19 pandemic. This kind of motivation has similarities, especially in terms of the motivation to use IT as a learning tool in supporting the successful learning process at the Buddhist College. The motivation itself is the achievement motivation, especially to help the students develop the interpersonal communication ability in the learning process through online media. McClelland (Siburian, 2013) stated that there are four standard aspects of achievement motivation, namely 1) risktaking 2) immediate feedback 3) achievement satisfaction, 4) loving the job. In terms of students\u2019 motivation, the standards in achievement motivation include 1) willingness to participate in online learning, 2) being able to adapt to online learning, 3) encouragement to succeed in learning, and 4) strong effort and enjoyment during the learning process. In realizing good interpersonal communication within the academic process in the era of the covid19 pandemic, openness is needed, which is realized by equality, selflessness, harmlessness, and mutual trust (Hidayat, 2012). The communication between the learning process can be effective, yet it requires students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 openness, environmental interaction, and equality among them (Rina et al., 2019). Meanwhile, in developing interpersonal communication through openness, in this case, it is necessary to have equality, values, environmental interactions, and trust between the students and the teachers."

Confidence, based on their objectivity in academic communication, is at 74.4%, which is considered very good, while rationality is at 76% which is very good as well. However, there are also results of the survey answers showing students with a lack of self-confidence, with an average range of 3% for each indicator, the survey answers showing the students with average self-confidence were ranging from 6% to 7%. This further illustrates that in online learning, it is necessary to increase student confidence in the process of all academic interactions. Students' self-confidence in conducting academic communication interactions in the learning process can also be affected by the internet network quality. Statistically, almost 23.7% of respondents stated that they underwent internet reception disturbances during the communication process.\nE-ISSN 2240-0524 ISSN 2239-978X\nJournal of Educational and Social Research www.richtmann.org\nVol 12 No 1 January 2022"

On the other hand, factors like the willingness to communicate, the willingness to adapt, and the effort have resulted in a relatively smaller percentage, ranging from 3% to 4%.

This gives an illustration that there is still unwillingness toward openness in academic communication in the online learning process. Finally, there is 2% of the respondents, who did not respond to problem-solving in the online learning process, through communication, including to their colleagues. This may get worse due to the existence of students\u2019 environmental conditions, especially the internet network.

            "text": "The results of this study indicate that the interpersonal communication of Buddhist College students during the covid-19 pandemic, especially during online learning processes, can be explained by several influencing factors. Those influencing factors are motivation, self-confidence, and openness. Each factor can be described in terms of the indicators that affect it. This shows that there are similarities with the opinion of Khajavy et al. [19]. Variables that have an important role in communication in the learning process are self-confidence, motivation, and anxiety in delivery. In terms of openness, this is in line with the opinion of DeVito, (DeVito, 2013), who stated that one of\nE-ISSN 2240-0524 ISSN 2239-978X\nJournal of Educational and Social Research www.richtmann.org\nVol 12 No 1 January 2022\nthe factors that influence interpersonal communication is openness. The openness referred to in the findings of this study, in the form of openness inequality between lecturers and students, value in communication, environmental interaction, and mutual trust. Motivation factors play the most important roles in interpersonal communication. This is in line with McClelland's opinion (Siburian, 2013), (Ridha, 2020). It was stated that there are four standard aspects of achievement motivation, namely 1) risk-taking 2) immediate feedback, 3) achievement satisfaction, and 4) loving the job. The results of the research are in line with this opinion, stating that achievement motivation in interpersonal communication in the academic field is in the form of willingness to learn online, the ability to adapt to the learning process, encouragement to gain academic achievement, and good communication ability when participating in the online learning process. The motivational factor influencing academic interpersonal communication is the most powerful. The motivation for achievement becomes the catalyst in achieving those goals. Encouragement will emerge continuously, with various challenges, and the ability to accept feedback as part of improvement. Achievement motivation can be interpreted as part of the driving force of the individual to behave (Sugiyono, 2003). Openness in academic communication is an important part of self-disclosure (DeVito, 2013). The sense of openness will make it easier to understand what is learned and practiced. Equality in communication, environmental and social interaction, and mutual trust and value become an important part of the success of academic interpersonal communication. Interpersonal communication is an important part of helping someone to be successful in achieving goals. This is by the opinion of Morreale & Pearson (DeVito, 2013). The ability in interpersonal communication will make it easier to describe and implement the target steps in the learning process. Finally, the quality of interpersonal competence and supporting factors that influence interpersonal competence can help students to improve their academic achievement."
