 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the antibacterial activity of the enzymatically modified lysozyme preparations against a wider range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The paper mentions conducting a full study on antibacterial activity, so expanding the types of bacteria tested could provide useful insights.

2. Investigate the potential anticancer effects of the lysozyme peptide preparations. The introduction mentions lysozyme's application in cancer treatment, so the bioactive peptides may have anticancer properties worth exploring. 

3. Determine if combining the enzymatic modification with other methods (e.g. thermal, chemical) can further enhance the functional properties of the lysozyme preparations. The paper mentions lysozyme modifications like oligomerization - combining methods may have additive effects.

4. Test the bioavailability and stability of the lysozyme peptide preparations under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. This could provide information on their potential for oral administration and supplement use.

5. Explore the effects of enzymatic modification on the allergenicity of lysozyme. Since lysozyme can be an allergen, seeing if the modifications reduce allergenicity could expand its applications.
