INTRODUCTION\nModuli stabilization is one of the necessary prerequisites for compactified string theories to describe a fourdimensional world with a hierarchical separation of scales between this and extra-dimensional physics. The traditional tools to construct such vacua, effective field theory and dimensional reduction, have come under close scrutiny with the advent of the swampland program [1\u20133]. For this reason, it was proposed in Refs. [4\u20137] that holography might provide an independent approach to test the consistency of anti\u2013de Sitter (AdS) vacua, by analyzing the properties of the putative dual conformal field theories (CFTs). One of the most studied scenarios of moduli stabilization featuring scale separation is the type IIA DeWolfeGiryavets-Kachru-Taylor (DGKT) flux vacua [8], and scale separated IIA vacua have received considerable attention lately [7,9\u201314], as the scale separation property has been conjectured to lie in the swampland [15\u201318].1 From a holographic point of view, scale separated vacua also admit a clear interpretation in terms of CFTs with a gapped spectrum, which could also point towards inconsistencies [19]. Therefore, DGKT provides a particularly interesting\nexample to study in this context (see Ref. [20] for an early investigation). In this paper we give a concise derivation of the mass matrix for general IIA DGKT flux vacua and show that, interpreted holographically, it has an extremely simple form. In particular, the conformal dimensions of scalar operators dual to the moduli are both integers and also highly degenerate. These results are suggestive of a hidden structure that is best understood from a dual CFT perspective. Our argument establishes in full generality results hinted at in Refs. [6,7], where these results were found for simple specific examples of DGKT. Although the argument here is more concise, a derivation of the mass matrix for general DGKT vacua (although without a link to conformal dimensions) also appears spread across the two papers [21,22]."

In particular, this is obtained by compactifying massive IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau orientifolds with O6 planes (for which the effective field theory was derived in Refs. [23,24]), which allows for stable AdS4 vacua in the controlled limit of large volumes and weak string coupling [8]. This was demonstrated in Ref. [8] for a fully explicit example based on a T6=Z3 \u00d7 Z3 orientifold with no complex structure (CS) moduli (h2;1 \u00bc 0). There, the axio-dilaton, K\u00e4hler moduli and axions were all stabilized by fluxes.

Although the equations cannot be solved explicitly for arbitrary triple intersection numbers \u03baabc and fluxes ea, ma, the \u201cimplicit\u201d form of the matrix derived above is not only sufficient for our purposes, but it is more helpful to elucidate the surprising simplifications in the final expressions. To compute the eigenvalues of K\u22121L, one can begin by noticing that any vector of the form\nx \u00bc \u00f0xi; x0\u00de with x0Ks \u00bc 4Kaxa \u00f044\u00de\nsatisfies K\u22121Lx \u00bc 0. This essentially descends from the fact that M can be expressed as a tensor product Lmn \u00bc AmAn, with Am \u00bc \u00f02Ka;\u2212Ks=2\u00de. One therefore has a basis of h1;1\u2212 eigenvectors with an eigenvalue of \u03bbix \u00bc 0. Furthermore, the no-scale relations (3)\u2013(8) imply that the vector\ny \u00bc \u00f0vi; K\u22121s \u00de; \u00f045\u00de\nis also an eigenvector of L, with eigenvalue \u03bby \u00bc 13.

[22]. Through the relation \u0394\u00f0\u0394 \u2212 d\u00de \u00bc m2R2AdS, they correspond to conformal dimensions of\n\u03941 \u00bc 10; \u03942\u2026h1;1\u2212 \u00fe1 \u00bc 6 \u00f048\u00de\nfor the saxions, and\n\u03941 \u00bc 11; \u03942\u2026h1;1\u2212 \u00fe1 \u00bc 5 \u00f049\u00de\nfor the corresponding axions. Similar conclusions can be drawn for all the complex structure moduli as well. From Eq.

            "text": "We have shown how\u2014if we assume they actually exist\u2014the spectrum of the CFT3 duals to supersymmetric DGKT type IIA flux vacua is characterized by a spectrum of integer conformal dimensions for the low-lying primaries. This result generalizes an observation first made in Ref. [6] for the simplest case of a T6=Z3 \u00d7 Z3 orientifold, and later extended in Ref. [7] to a wide range of examples. For a generic modulus, the conformal dimension is given by one of the very few integer values in Eqs. (48)\u2013(50). It is surprising to see how these numbers do not bear any trace of the microscopic details of the compactification, i.e., the values of the fluxes and the geometry of the orientifold. Such a simple and universal behavior is suggestive of the fact that the holographic perspective offers a both novel and insightful viewpoint on these constructions. Despite the simplicity of the result, the calculation itself does not seem to yield any clear insight into why such a striking property should hold. Its outcome relies on the noscale relations for the K\u00e4hler potential, as well as some more specific conditions involving the superpotential and its derivatives, Eqs. (16) and (17). One might wonder whether supersymmetry plays a role: already at the N \u00bc 1 level, the structure of the superconformal multiplets implies that the conformal dimensions of axions and saxions should differ by one. A further observation is that no-scale relations partially depend on the factorization of the K\u00e4hler potential into a sum of two terms (depending only on the K\u00e4hler and complex structure moduli respectively), which could be seen as a remnant of a more constraining N \u00bc 2 supersymmetry of the original supergravity theory, where the K\u00e4hler potential factorizes into hypermultiplet and vector multiplet terms. Generally, one would expect that N \u00bc 1 corrections would break this factorization and introduce mixing between the K\u00e4hler and complex structure moduli. Examples of such corrections would be \u03b10 and gs corrections which, generically, would not preserve the N \u00bc 2 structure. The DGKT vacua have a scale-separated limit of large volume and weak coupling; one would expect this limit to suppress such corrections, with an asymptotic limit in which corrections to the integer conformal dimensions vanish asymptotically. More generally, it would be extremely fascinating to come up with a deeper explanation of either the integer dimensions or the large degeneracies amongst the operators. A related question one might hope to address in the future is whether any similar structure holds for the 6It would be interesting to understand how supersymmetry implements this from an AdS perspective, where the choices correspond to different boundary conditions for the scalar field.\n106029-5\nnonsupersymmetric vacua as well, as suggested by the examples in Refs. [6,7]. In a long-term perspective, an interesting direction would involve trying to understand if one could either prove or disprove the consistency of these (or similar) fourdimensional vacua using ideas from AdS=CFT."
