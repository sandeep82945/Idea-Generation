1. **Investigate the impact of cooling rate on the crystallization behavior of other organic phase-change materials (PCMs).** The current study focused on n-eicosane, but it is important to determine if the observed trends are generalizable to other PCMs. This would help to establish the broader applicability of the findings and provide guidance for the design of PCM-based thermal energy storage systems.


2. **Explore the relationship between cooling rate and the formation of different crystal structures in PCMs.** The current study showed that fast cooling can lead to the formation of less ordered crystalline structures in n-eicosane. It would be interesting to investigate whether this is a general phenomenon and to explore the factors that influence the formation of different crystal structures. This knowledge could be used to control the properties of PCMs and optimize their performance in thermal energy storage applications.


3. **Investigate the impact of cooling rate on the thermal transport properties of PCMs.** The current study showed that fast cooling can lead to a decrease in the thermal conductivity of n-eicosane. It would be interesting to investigate whether this is a general phenomenon and to explore the mechanisms responsible for the observed decrease in thermal conductivity. This knowledge could be used to design PCMs with improved thermal transport properties, which would be beneficial for thermal energy storage applications.


4. **Develop multiscale modeling approaches to study the crystallization of PCMs.** The current study employed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the crystallization of n-eicosane. However, it would be beneficial to develop multiscale modeling approaches that can bridge the gap between atomistic and continuum scales. This would allow for the study of larger systems and longer time scales, which would be necessary to capture the full complexity of the crystallization process.


5. **Investigate the impact of cooling rate on the performance of PCM-based thermal energy storage systems.** The current study focused on the fundamental aspects of the crystallization of PCMs. However, it would be important to investigate how the cooling rate affects the performance of PCM-based thermal energy storage systems. This would involve studying the charging and discharging characteristics of the systems, as well as their overall efficiency. This knowledge could be used to optimize the design and operation of PCM-based thermal energy storage systems.
