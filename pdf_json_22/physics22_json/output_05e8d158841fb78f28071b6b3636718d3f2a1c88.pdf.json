            "text": "During the past decade, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been widely studied owing to their unique properties, such as sizable bandgap,1,2 optimal detection,3,4 and ideal exibility.5\u20137 While most people focus on group-6 TMDCs (MoS2, WS2, MoTe2, etc.),8 a newly emerging group-7 TMDCmaterial, ReS2, has attractedmuch attention due to its unique thickness-independent direct band-gap (Eg z 1.4 eV).9,10 Due to its unique 1T distorted structure, the interlayer coupling energy of ReS2 is much weaker than other TMDCs.9 The weak inter-layer coupling results in a continuous direct bandgap from bulk to monolayer, and the PL peak moves slightly (between 1.5 and 1.6 eV) with the intensity reduced. These properties made ReS2 and its heterostructures11\u201313 exhibit high performance in photodetectors. In addition, ReS2 and its heterostructures exhibit polarization-dependent photoresponse.14\u201316 To date, ReS2-based eld effect transistors have been reported to have a switching ratio as high as 107,17 good detection performance (the photoresponsivity can reach up to 106 A W 1),18 and high response time up to 20 ms.19 However, in\nShanghai Institute of Technical Physics, Road, Shanghai 200083, China.

Besides, the above devices used rigid dielectrics like oxides (Al2O3, SiO2, etc.). As a result, the device structures and constructed materials heavily limit practical applications in exible photoelectric devices, such as articial electronic skin,20 wearable systems,5 bionic detectors,21 etc. New dielectrics materials and new device structures are needed for further investigation to realize high-performance exible devices.\nOrganic ferroelectric material P(VDF-TrFE) is a promising option for gate dielectrics. Ferroelectric materials, such as aIn2Se3,22 LiNbO3,23 HfO2 (ref. 24) etc., has been proved to have good performance in ferroelectric eld effect transistors (FeFETs). As to photodetectors, the ferroelectric eld could increase the mobility, photoresponsivity, detectivity, and photoresponse speed.25 Moreover, aer polarization, the remanent polarization is strong enough to keep the device working for months, which means low power consumption.26\u201328 On the other hand, as a solution-made organic material, it has huge potential for large-area exible electronics. Previous researchers have made many nonvolatile memory devices29,30 and capacitors31\u201333 on exible substrates to study the ferroelectric properties under strain.34,35 However, the electrical and photoelectrical properties of 2D materials & P(VDF-TrFE) based FeFET under strain have not been studied. Thus, a study on highperformance exible photodetectors enhanced by ferroelectric eld and strain eld is necessary.\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 4939\u20134945 | 4939\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Next, the source (S) and drain (D) metal electrodes were fabricated using electron-beam lithography, thermal evaporation of Cr/Au lms (15 nm/45 nm), and li\ue09d-off by acetone. The following step was coating the P(VDF-TrFE) (70 : 30 in mol%) lm as the top gate material. Finally, the ultrathin semitransparent aluminum (z10 nm) electrodes were deposited. The thickness of ReS2 is further conrmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 1(b), the thickness of ReS2 is approximately 10 nm.\nHere we chose PI as the substrate for its heat stability ranging from 200 to 300 C, poison-free, and insoluble in organic solvents. This means compatible with silicon processes and suitable for most situations. PI material and 2D materials have a good affinity, so that 2D materials are easy to adhere to the PI substrate. PI is suitable for bending for its elasticity modulus is up to 3\u20134 GPa. In addition, the 25 mm-thickness polyimide is suitable for control, because 2D materials on thick polyimide are hard to be bent and 2D materials on thin polyimide are easy to have wrinkles.\nReS2 akes were analyzed via photoluminescence (PL) and Raman, which suggested the good quality of the multi-akes as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d).

            "text": "First, we studied how the remnant polarization enhances the device's electric properties. The thickness of the P(VDF-TrFE) layer is 300 nm (measured by Step Proler). The transfer curves (Id\u2013Vg) (drain-source current Id as a function of top gate voltage Vg) of the ReS2 transistor were tested at room temperature (shown in Fig. 2(a)). The large memory window (z25 V) in transfer curves between the voltage rise and decrease is related to the ferroelectric polarization switching process. The mobility m z 115.3 cm2 V 1 s 1 was calculated by\nm \u00bc dId dVg\nL\n\u00f0W303r=dVd\u00de\nwhere L \u00bc 5.0 mm is the channel length, W \u00bc 2.0 mm is the channel width, 3r \u00bc 10 is the dielectric constant of P(VDF-TrFE), d\u00bc 300 nm is the thickness of P(VDF-TrFE) lms, and dId/dVg is extracted from the le side of the transfer curve in Fig. 2(a). The output characteristic curves Id\u2013Vd of three different polarized states are showed in Fig. 2(b). The initial state of the P(VDFTrFE) lm is called fresh state. In this state, P(VDF-TrFE) lm has not been polarized, and its dipoles are in disorder. No residual polarized electric eld is generated, so it has little effect on the channel. A 40 V gate voltage applied made P(VDF-TrFE) lm in polarization up state (P-up). The positive charges gather on the interface between P(VDF-TrFE) and ReS2. These positive charges would deplete the charges in channel. Then the carrier concentration is reduced and the dark current could be so low. Besides, the increase of the barrier also reduces the dark current. A 40 V gate voltage applied made P(VDF-TrFE) lm in polarization down state (P-down). The negative charges gather\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\non the interface and the channel was fully accumulated. Current in P-up state is ve orders of magnitude smaller than current in P-down state. Operating the device in the P-up state brings the advantage of a reduced dark current.\nNext, the photoresponse of the ReS2 photodetector was measured at a ZERO gate voltage in the P-up state. As is shown in Fig. 3(a), the light at 830 nm is incident perpendicularly to the device surface, and the spot covers the entire channel uniformly. The ultrahigh local electrostatic eld induced by the upward-polarized P(VDF-TrFE) makes the ReS2 channel fully depleted, which means the photodetector would have an ultralow dark current. As a result, the ferroelectric eld keeps the ReS2 photodetector at a sensitive state in a power efficient way. The photo switching properties (under Vd \u00bc 100 mV) at a wavelength of 830 nm and 1310 nm are shown in Fig. 3(b). The detector has good response for the wavelength of 830 nm light illumination and almost no response for 1310 nm. Fig. 3(c) shows the photocurrent exhibits rapid rise/fall and reaches a steady saturation. The rise (tr) and decay (tf) times of photocurrent are measured as 6.6 ms and 6.1 ms, respectively, and both the rise and decay curves (in black) are tted well using a single exponential functions (in red) shown in Fig. 3(c). The responsivity R \u00bc Iph/Peff, where Iph is the photocurrent in a detector and Peff is the effective illumination power. It is worth mentioning that Peff is calculated by Peff \u00bc APp 1r 2, where A is the area of the sample, P is the actual laser output and r is the radius of the laser spot size. In addition, the detectivity, assuming that noise from dark current is the major factor, is given by D* \u00bc RA1/2/(2eIdark)1/2, where R is the responsivity, A is the area of the detector, e is the unit charge, and Idark is the dark current (under 0.1 V bias here).24,37 The device exhibits a photoresponsivity (R) of 11.3 A W 1, and the detectivity (D*) is up to 1.7 1010 Jones approximately when the wavelength is 830 nm, a laser power of 1 pW, and Vd \u00bc 100 mV. The maximum detectivity of 1.7 1010 Jones has been achieved. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the high detectivity and responsivity decrease dramatically with the increasing signal power.\nBased on the research of P(VDF-TrFE) based FeFET, the photoelectric properties under strain are studied.

The strains were quantied by the equation: 3 \u00bc (t/r)/2,6 where t is the substrate thickness (25 mm for the PI substrates used here) and r is the bending radius of 30, 15, 10, 5 mm. Assuming that as-fabricated exfoliated devices before bending are virtually strain-free,38 we get ve strains 3 z 0.00, 0.04, 0.08, 0.125, and 0.25%, respectively. The channel is along the b-axis (as shown in Fig. 1(b)), and so is the strain. This is the optimal option for strain modulation in this study. Fig. 4(b) shows the output characteristics of FeFET under different strains in dark state. The dark current went through a decrease under little strain and an increase when strain becomes larger. The \u20180\u2019 state is the state before bending and aer polarization. The \u20180-again\u2019 state is the state return to \u20180\u2019 state aer bending. Fig. 4(c) shows the normalized photoresponsivity of the ReS2 phototransistor under strain. When a little strain is applied, the responsivity increases with the increase of strain. When the strain is 0.08%, the optical response reaches a maximum which is 2.6 times that strain is 0. The responsivity keeps a steady level when the strain is over 0.08%. Fig. 4(d) shows the normalized detectivity of the ReS2 phototransistor under strain. When the strain is 0.08%, the optical response reaches its maximum, which is 1.8 times that strain is 0. This means the device can achieve the best photoresponse with the 0.08% strain applied where the minimum\nFig. 3 Optoelectronic properties of the P(VDF-TrFE)/ReS2 FET on PI sub device surface, and the spot covers the entire channel uniformly.

In addition, when the device was released, it was almost returned to its original state, and the process can be repeated.\nFig. 4(e)\u2013(g) show themechanism of strainmodulation of the photodetector. The top electrode, P(VDF-TrFE) and ReS2 could be seen as a parallel plate capacitor. In a parallel plate capacitor, total quantity of electric charge (Q) is dened as Q \u00bc 303rSE, where 30 is the permittivity of vacuum, 3r is the relative permittivity, S is the area of plate and E is the electric eld intensity. When a small strain applied, the electric eld (E) provided by P(VDF-TrFE) is constant whereas the area (S) increases. This would lead to the increase of quantity of electric charge (Q). The increasing of Q at the interface between P(VDFTrFE) and ReS2 would get more charges depleted. Thus, the carrier concentration reduces and the Fermi energy raises up. The dark current becomes lower then. With strain increase further, the dark current increases. The increase of dark current is mainly due to the narrowing of ReS2' bandgap. When the channel direction was made along the b-axis and the strain was applied along the channel direction, the decrease of the VBM is slower than that of the CBM, leading to the narrowing of the bandgap.36 As the carriers are fully depleted in P-up state, Ec EF \u00bc Eg/2, where Ec is the conduction band edge, EF is the Fermi energy and Eg is the bandgap.

Therefore, the conductivity would increase with the bandgap decreasing. For the dark current is proportional to s, the dark current increases. Besides, it was witnessed that the dark current aer bending released is smaller than the dark current before bending. That results from some charged interface states disappearing aer bending. Based on the modulation on dark current, the corresponding responsivity and detectivity were modulated accordingly. Overall, the performance of the photodetector is further enhanced by strain modulation.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry"
