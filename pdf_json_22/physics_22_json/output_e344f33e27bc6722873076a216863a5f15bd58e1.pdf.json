    "abstractText": "As a completely independent method, the measurement of time delay of strongly lensed quasars (TDSL) are crucial to resolve the Hubble tension. Extensive monitoring is required but so far limited to a small sample of strongly lensed quasars. Together with several partner institutes, Beijing Normal University is constructing a 1.93m reflector telescope at the Muztagh-Ata site in west China, which has the world class observing conditions with median seeing of 0.82 arcsec and median sky brightness of 21.74mag arcsec\u22122 in V-band during the dark time. The telescope will be equipped with both a three-channel imager/photometer which covers 3500 \u2212 11000 Angstrom wavelength band, and a low-medium resolution (\u03bb/\u03b4\u03bb = 500/2000/7500) spectrograph. In this paper, we investigate the capability of Muztagh-Ata 1.93m telescope in measuring time delays of strongly lensed quasars. We generate mock strongly lensed quasar systems and light curves with microlensing effects based on five known strongly lensed quasars, i.e., RX J1131-1231, HE 0435-1223, PG 1115+080, WFI 2033-4723 and SDSS 1206+4332. In particular, RX J1131-1231 is generated with lens modeling in this work. Due to lack of enough information, we simulate the other 4 systems with the public data without lens modeling. According to simulations, for RX J1131-like systems (wide variation in time delay between images) the TDSL measurement can be achieved with the precision about \u0394t = 0.5 day with 4 seasons campaign length and 1 day cadence. This accuracy is comparable to the up-coming TDCOSMO project. And it would be better when the campaign length keeps longer and with high cadence. As a result, the capability of Muztagh-Ata 1.93m telescope allows it to join the network of TDSL observatories. It will enrich the database for strongly lensed quasar observations and make more precise measurements of time delays, especially considering the unique coordinate of the site.",

However, there is a serious discrepancy on the measured Hubble constant value between different methods Freedman (2017); Aghanim et al. (2020); Abbott et al. (2018); Riess et al. (2019); Freedman et al. (2019). One of the most traditional methods of determining \ud835\udc3b0, namely the distance ladder, uses three different distance indicators ranged from nearby milky way to the faraway cosmological scales. This method utilize the parallax measurement, Cepheid variables Riess et al. (2019), the tip of red-giant branch stars (TRGB) Freedman et al. (2019) and Type Ia supernovae. The most recent controversial measurements gives the best-fit value of \ud835\udc3b0 = 73.2 \u00b1 1.3 km s\u22121Mpc\u22121 Riess et al.

(2020). The CMB and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) methods currently yield lower values of \ud835\udc3b0, while Cepheids yield the highest values and TRGB results falling in the middle Freedman (2021). In order to figure out whether the tension is due to unaccounted systematic\n\u2605 E-mail: bhu@bnu.edu.cn\n\u00a9 2021 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n15 68\n0v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .C\nerrors, or the existence of \u201cnew physics\u201d, we need independent measurements with accuracy better than 2% Verde et al. (2019). One of the promising approach is to use the time delay between multiple images of strong lensing Oguri (2007); Coe & Moustakas (2009); Wong et al. (2020), namely \u201ctime-delay cosmography\u201d. Light from a distant object is splitted and produces multiple images, when it intervenes massive objects along its path. As light travels in different paths and feels different gravitational forces, the light of images do not always reach the observer at the same time and it causes time delays. The time delays among images are affected not only by the mass distribution in the lens plane and the projected mass along the line of sight, but also depends on the geometry of lens system. Hence, an accurate measurement of the time delay helps to measure the Hubble constant.\nIn 1964, Refsdal proposed the ideal of using gravitational lensing time delay as a tool to measure \ud835\udc3b0 Refsdal (1964). The first actual strong lensing measurement is done by Walsh et al. (1979). It was a quasar lensing system (Q0957+561) at redshift \ud835\udc67 = 1.4. The first measurement of time delay was made by Schild & Cholfin (1986), and was later confirmed by Vanderriest et al. (1989). Quasars are ideal sources for \u201ctime-delay cosmography\u201d thanks to their high luminosity and variability. To date, more and more strongly lensed quasar systems have been discovered in various surveys Oguri et al. (2006); Inada et al. (2012); More et al. (2016). More importantly, some of the lensed quasar systems have been used to measure \ud835\udc3b0 Birrer et al. (2019); Wong et al. (2020). There are several teams focus on this topic, such as COSMOGRAIL1, H0LiCOW2 and STRIDES3. The COSMOGRAIL project began in 2004 with a mission to monitor strongly lensed quasars and measure the time delays. The collaboration monitored dozens of lensed quasars with six 1-2m class telescopes all around the world. This network is constituted by the Swiss 1.2 m Euler telescope located at La Silla, Chile; the Swiss-Belgian 1.2 m Mercator telescope, located in the Canaria islands (La Palma, Spain); the 2 m robotic telescope of the Liverpool University (UK) at La Palma; the 1.5 m telescope of Maidanak observatory in Uzbekistan; the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) in Hanle, Indian ; and 2m2 MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla.\nA 1.93m reflector telescope equipped with both a three-channel imager/photometer and a low-medium resolution spectrograph is currently under the construction at Muztagh-Ata site and will be finished in 2-3 years. And Figure 1 is the conceptual design of it. The telescope is mainly invested by Be\u0133ing Normal University (BNU) and cooperated with Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory (XAO), Nanjing Institute of Astronomical Optics and Technology of Chinese Academy of Sciences (NIAOT) and Xinjiang University (XJU). The photometry wavelength band covers 3500 \u2212 11000 Angstrom and spectrograph has three resolution, \ud835\udeff\ud835\udf06/\ud835\udf06 = 500/2000/7500. The field of view is 20 arcmin with help\n1 cosmograil.org 2 h0licow.org 3 strides.astro.ucla.edu\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2021)\nof the correction mirror. The 300s exposure 10\ud835\udf0e limiting magnitude in V-band is 23.79. The telescope is designed in the R-C optical system with three focus, namely the Cassegrain focus, the declination axis focus and the coud\u00e9 focus. The effective aperture of the telescope is 1.93 meter and the focal ratio is \ud835\udc53 /8. The pixel size of CCD is 13.5 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc5a. The scale on the focal plane is 0.183\u2032\u2032/pix and the quantum efficiency is about 0.95. The guiding system can keep the tracking precision at the 0.3 arcsec level within 2 hours. The pointing precision is expected to be 5 arcsec with the pointing model correction. And it can be improved to the 1 arcsec level after the secondary correction.\nMuztagh-Ata site is located at 38\u25e619\u203247\u2032\u2032N and 74\u25e653\u203248\u2032\u2032E in the southwest of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China, with an altitude of 4526 meters. The full view of the site is presented in Figure 2. It is one of the best astronomical sites in China. The seeing median value is 0.82 arcsec Xu et al. (2020b). The median value of the sky brightness is 21.35 mag arcsec\u22122 in V-band during the nighttime. For the case without moon, this number can be upgraded into 21.74mag arcsec\u22122 (V-band). The median of relative humidity is 49% for nighttime and 39% for daytime. The median value of nighttime wind speed is 5.5ms\u22121 and it is 6.5ms\u22121 for daytime Xu et al. (2020a). All these conditions makes the telescope ideal for time-domain astronomical researches.\nIn this paper, we forecast the capability of observing time delay of strongly lensed quasars (TDSL) with Muztagh-Ata 1.93m telescope. The rest of the paper are structured as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the lens modeling. Section 3 describes the simulation process. The method of measuring time delays are given in Section 4. In Section 5, we arrive our conclusions. In this study, we adopt a flat \u039bCDM cosmology model with parameter \u03a9\ud835\udc5a = 0.3 and \u210e = 0.7."

We introduce the angular coordinates in the image plane as \ud835\udf3d , which are perpendicular to the line of sight, and angular coordinate in the source plane as \ud835\udf37. The coordinates in the image and source planes are related through the lens equation\n\ud835\udf37 = \ud835\udf3d \u2212 \ud835\udf36(\ud835\udf03) = \ud835\udf3d \u2212 \u2207\ud835\udf03\ud835\udf13(\ud835\udf03), (1) where \ud835\udf36(\ud835\udf03) is the deflection angle, \ud835\udf13(\ud835\udf03) is the effective lens potential and \u2207\ud835\udf03 is the gradient in the image plane with respect to \ud835\udf03.

To produce multiple images, the source must cross an infinite magnification curve, which corresponds to a denominator of 0 in Eq. (4) and divides the region where the new image is generated. Such curves are called critical curves in the image plane and caustics in the source plane.

For example, the gas and dust particles in the lens galaxies are much smaller than the luminous sources, hence, they are always treated as the continuous component. The angular Einstein radius of a star is comparable to the size of quasar, so in this case, stars cannot be regarded as continuous mass but compact mass. However, stars should be regarded as continuous matter when the source is a galaxy Petters et al. (2001).\nMicrolensing can be thought of strong lensing at a small scale produced by compact matter. Because the image separation induced by microlensing is too small to be resolved, one can only hunt for the microlensing effect via the variation in the magnification. Here, we denote the total mass surface density as \ud835\udf05, the continuous mass surface density as \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc50 and the compact mass surface density \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc60 . Besides, we introduce the stellar fraction \ud835\udc53\u2217 for lens galaxies, which is the ratio of the stellar mass to the total mass. The general lens equation with microlensing reads\n\u00ae\ud835\udc66 = ( 1 \u2212 \ud835\udefe 0 0 1 + \ud835\udefe ) \u00ae\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc50 \u00ae\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc41\u2217\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56 (\u00ae\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u00ae\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56) (\u00ae\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u00ae\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56)2 . (12)\n4 cfa-www.harvard.edu/castles\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2021)\nIn this paper, we use FORTRAN package microlens developed by Wambsganss (1999) to simulate the magnification maps of microlensing with the method of re-shooting. The spatial distribution of the stellar are random. The mass distribution is chosen to follow Salpeter\u2019s initial mass distribution function as \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc41/\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc40 \u221d \ud835\udc40\u22122.35. The maximum and minimum mass limits are 10\ud835\udc40 and 0.01\ud835\udc40 , respectively. Given \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc50 and shear \ud835\udefe, we generate magnification maps of images. Figure 4 shows the map of image B of RX J1131, in which \ud835\udf05 and \ud835\udefe are calculated from the lens modeling and \ud835\udc53\u2217 follows Chen et al. (2019) which divides \ud835\udf05 into \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc50 . The sub-panels labeled with \u201cno convolve\u201d denote for the case where we treat the quasar as an ideal point source. The \u201cwith convolve\u201d ones are the more realistic case, where we take the finite quasar source area into consideration. Hence, compared with the left, the caustics in the right sub-plots are more blurred. The convolution is done by smoothing the point source map with a Gaussian radius \ud835\udc45src = 5 \u00d7 1013m. The black bar in the figure denotes for the transverse trajectory of the quasar in the source plane during the observation period, namely 4 years in this case. We randomly pick up a direction and set the relative velocity between source and lens as \ud835\udc63vel = 500\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a/\ud835\udc60, which is consistent with the mean velocity calculated by Neira et al. (2020) as 488\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a/\ud835\udc60. The box size for these two magnification maps is 4 \ud835\udf03 (Einstein radii of a solar mass lens). As the redshifts of the lens and source for RX J1131 are 0.295 and 0.657, respectively Millon et al. (2020c). For RX J1131, \ud835\udf03 is 2.13 \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udc45src = 0.11\ud835\udf03 and \ud835\udc63vel = 3.44\u00d7 10\u22122\ud835\udf03 /yr.\nFigure 5 shows the probability distribution of microlensing effect for the \"with convolution\" and \"without convolution\" cases. We calculate the range and average microlensing effects based on 5000 randomly distributed transverse trajectories over the 4-year observation period under two different cases. The four images are represented by orange, purple, green and blue, respectively. It can be seen that the variation range of the microlensing curves decreases significantly after convolution while the average distribution is almost unchanged."

            "text": "RX J1131 is a typical target located within the observable sky patch of Muztagh-Ata 1.93m telescope. We made a rough estimation of its observable time with two conditions: (1) the target shall be in the altitude range between 30-80 degrees; (2) the target shall be 45 degrees away from the moon at the least. According to our calculations, the observable time of RX J1131 is about 200 days per year from our site, as shown in Figure 6. Our purpose is to discuss the capability of measuring TDSL with Muztagh-Ata 1.93m telescope, rather than to give prediction for a specific target. Based on the field measurements at Muztagh-Ata site Xu et al. (2020a,b,c), we believe 200 observable days per season (ie., per year) is reasonable number for our simulations. In order to demonstrate the robustness of measuring TDSL with 1.93m telescope, here we consider several cadences as well as observation campaign length. In details, we simulate the monitoring with 2 cadences (1 and 3 days) and 4 campaign lengths (2, 3, 4 and 8 seasons).\nFigure 7 illustrates the light-curve data generation process. As an example, we show the 4 season data with 1 day cadence. To get a better visualization effect, we only show the light-curves of the images with the maximum delay, namely image A (orange) and D (blue). To avoid\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2021)\nthe overlap in the figure, the brightness of image D is subtracted with a number 2.1 in magnitudes. From the top to bottom, we firstly generate the intrinsic quasar light-curve and plus the time delay and magnification from strong lensing; then add magnification from microlensing on top of the intrinsic light variation5; and finally take the cadence effect into account. Here we assume the constant sky brightness and seeing 21.35 mag arcsec\u22122 and 0.82\u2032\u2032, respectively. And the readout noise is set as \ud835\udc45readout = 5.\nFor RX J1131, we generate the brightness data by lenstronomy. The statistical photon errors are estimated via Monte Carlo simulations rather than the analytical formula. In each pixels, the background Gaussian noise per second is generated randomly according to the standard deviation\n\ud835\udf0eimg =\n\u221a\ufe03 \ud835\udc452readout + \ud835\udc61obs \u00b7 \ud835\udc5bsky\n\ud835\udc61obs , (13)\nwhere \ud835\udc5bsky is counts per second per pixel from the sky brightness. The photon fluctuations of the lens images are generated according to the Poisson distribution of the brightness. Each images are obtained by \ud835\udc61obs = 300\ud835\udc60 exposure. We call these maps as \u201cdata maps\u201d. Besides, we generate a \u201creference map\u201d with a much longer exposure time, which is used for subtraction of lens galaxy and host galaxy as their brightness are invariant. The brightness used to generate each image is the result of taking into account the light transmission rate of the telescope and the quantum efficiency of the CCD. After this, the images are smoothed by the Gaussian PSF with seeing size 0.82\u2032\u2032. We get the quasar images by subtracting the \u201cdata maps\u201d from the \u201creference map\u201d and then calculate the relative brightness via PSF photometry by photutils. At each epoch, 50 realisations of the data maps are generated, and the PSF photometric errors on the lensed images are calculated according to Eq.(14), where \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56 is the brightness of image relative to the reference map and ?\u0304? is the mean value of \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udf0e2 = 1\n\ud835\udc41 \u2212 1 \ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 (\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \ud835\udc5a)2 .

(2020d). The orange, purple, green and blue dots represent the results of 4 images of RX J1131 from PSF photometry, respectively. They are under the observation strategy of 4-season campaign length and 1-day sampling interval. Each dot represents the photometry measurement in one observation night. The black curve is the theoretical calculation with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) through Eq. (A1) and Eq.(A2). One can see that the error from theoretical calculation can be taken as a face value. 2M 1134-2103, PS J1606-2333, DES 0407-5006 are three systems with similar brightness to RX J1131. The green diamonds, red boxes and blue pentagons in the figure represent the empirical noise \ud835\udf0eemp, corresponding to the standard deviation of the measured image flux for these three systems, respectively. It can be seen that our photometric errors are roughly at the same level as TDCOSMO project."

            "heading": "4 TIME DELAY MEASUREMENT",
            "text": "In this section, we will present the time delay measurements of RX J1131 based the aforementioned simulated 4 seasons light-curve data. The brightness and corresponding errors are measured as illustrated in the Section 3.4. We use PyCS, a publicly available python toolbox developed by the COSMOGRAIL collaboration Millon et al. (2020a). It bases on the iterative nonlinear optimization algorithms and is fully data-driven. It can simultaneously estimate both the intrinsic time delay as well as those induced by microlensing. A free-knot spline estimator and a regression-difference estimator are provided. Both methods perform well in terms of precision and accuracy in the Time-Delay Challenge Liao et al. (2015). Nowadays, time delay cosmography studies are mostly based on these two methods, such as H0LiCOW and COSMOGRAIL collaborations. In this work, we use the free-knot spline estimator to measure the time delay between images and evaluate the uncertainties.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2021)\nThe free-knot spline estimator models light-curves with analytical spline functions. The details of the algorithm are as what follows. We go first for a rough estimation of the time-delay and then refine it for adjusting the local features. The position of the knots are fixed in the rough estimation. This step is used to search the global solution, which is less sensitive to the fine structures. After that, we freely vary the knots within the range of 10 days for finding the local features. A single common spline fits simultaneously for the intrinsic variations of all images. And independent splines fit individually on each light-curves for microlensing. The parameters of the estimator are: the initial spacing between the knots of the intrinsic spline (\ud835\udf02) and the initial spacing between the knots of the extrinsic splines (\ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59). They represent the mean spacing between knots before starting the optimisation.\nIn Figure. 9, we show an intermediate spline fitting result with (\ud835\udf02 = 35 days, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59 = 150 days). The black curve is the fitting result for the intrinsic light-curve. Orange, purple, green and blue curves are the fitting results for the extrinsic microlensing effect in image A, B, C and D, respectively6. In the upper panel, we plot the relative magnitude variation with respect to the reference magnitude. One can see that the typical variation is about 0.1mag. The bottom panels are the residuals between the input data and fitting results. The horizontal solid curves represent for the median absolute deviation, which is about 0.01 mag. Hence, we can conclude that this method gives relatively faithful reconstruction of the original signal.\nThe time delay and its errors are estimated as what follows Millon et al. (2020c). (1) We use the first guess delay as the starting point to get the preliminary measurement of time delays, splines and residuals of the fit. The first guess can be the result from the algorithm mentioned above, or simply a visual estimate. (2) In order to reduce the starting point dependence, the input light-curve is measured 500 times with starting points randomly selected around the first guess. The final time delay result is the median value of these measurements. (3) To estimate the uncertainties, we apply the estimator on mock light-curves with basically the same quality as the \u201creal\u201d data but different true delays. The\n6 Due to the code convention, here we show the opposite brightness variation induced by microlensing\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2021)\nsignals in the mock light-curves are constructed with the splines instead of the data generation process presented in Section 3. The noise is generated according to the noise power spectrum obtained from the fitting residuals. The splines and residuals used here are from the estimation in step 1. By shifting these curves in time, 800 sets of curves with known time delays are obtained. By comparing the measured value with the true delay, the uncertainty can be calculated as an orthogonal combination of the worst random error and the worst systematic error.\nHowever, the selection of parameters (\ud835\udf02, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59) will affect the time delay measurements to some extent. If the initial spacing was too large, some fast variations will be missed. A too small initial spacing between knots leads to an over-fitting of the data and also affect the results. Therefore, the choice of \ud835\udf02 and \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59 must be adapted to the data quality, which mainly depends on the cadence, photometric noise, time scale of data variation, etc. As stated previously, this method is fully driven by the observed data. It is almost impossible to determine which set of (\ud835\udf02, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59) are the most appropriate one.\nTo mitigate this issue, multiple sets of (\ud835\udf02, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59) parameters are measured in the optimal or marginalized sense. The first version of PyCS was implemented without functioning the multi-parameter combination Tewes et al. (2013), but was later refined by Millon et al. (2020c). The improved version adopted an hybrid approach between optimisation and marginalisation. This algorithm marginalises only the sets that do not have significant deviations in the measurements. This deviation, defined by the parameter \ud835\udf0f, describes the tension between the set to be marginalized with the reference set Bonvin et al. (2018). If the tension exceeds a certain threshold \ud835\udf0fthresh, we combine the most discrepant estimation with the reference. This combined estimation becomes the new reference and we repeated this process until no further tension exceeds \ud835\udf0fthresh. Figure. 10 illustrates each of (\ud835\udf02, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59) set result, and compare them with the combined estimation. The combined time delay\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2021)\nmeasurement (gray shaded region) is shown in the upper left of each panel, which is consistent with the true delay. For a pair of images A and B, a negative value of \u0394\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 means that image A varies first, and the vice versa. Results of observations with different cadence and campaign lengths are shown in Figure. 11. One can see that the measurement precision with high cadence are better than those with low cadence. In the former cases, we can achieve the time delay measurement error at the 0.5 day level with 4 seasons campaign length. This is our major result of this paper."

            "text": "Muztagh-Ata site is one of the best astronomical sites all over the world. The seeing median value is 0.82 arcsec. The median value of the sky brightness is 21.35 mag arcsec\u22122 in V-band during the nighttime. For the case without moon, this number can be upgraded into 21.74 mag arcsec\u22122 (V-band). An effective aperture 1.93m reflector telescope currently is under the construction phase leaded by Be\u0133ing Normal University in China. This telescope is equipped with both a three-channel imager/photometer (wavelength covers 3500\u221211000Angstrom) and a low-medium resolution (\ud835\udeff\ud835\udf06/\ud835\udf06 = 500/2000/7500) spectrograph. The field of view is 20 arcmin with the help of the correction mirror. The 300s exposure 10\ud835\udf0e limiting magnitude in V-band is 23.79. All these numbers indicate the 1.93m telescope is an ideal telescope for monitoring the light variation of the lensed quasar system.\nBased on the observation conditions of the Muztagh-Ata site and the instrument parameters of the 1.93m telescope, we simulate the lensed quasar observations with different cadences and campaign lengths, and forecast the precision of the measured time delay. We model quasar intrinsic light-curves, microlensing effect as well as the PSF photometric errors. We simulate RX J1131 with lens modeling in the main body section and other four systems without lens modeling in the Appendix. According to simulations, for RX J1131-like systems (wide variation in time delay between images) the time-delay observations of strongly lensed quasars can be achieved with the typical precision about \u0394\ud835\udc61 = 0.5 day with 4 seasons observation and 1 day cadence. This precision is comparable to the up-coming TDCOSMO project Millon et al. (2020b).\nThis paper presents a preliminary study of the time delay for strongly lensed quasars with Muztagh-Ata 1.93m telescope. The sky brightness and seeing are considered as constant, a bit ideally. Some of the sub-leading order systematics, such as the position of planets and moon, air humidity and weather has not yet been taken into account. We studied the time delay measurement precision with different strategies, which are characterized by the campaign lengths and sampling intervals. When increasing the cadence to one day, we are able to reach a very\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2021)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2021)\nprecise measurement of the time delay in a short campaign rather than decades of observations. As a result, the capability of 1.93m telescope allows it to join the network of TDSL observatories. It will enrich the database for strongly lensed quasar observations and make more precise measurements of time delays. We believe it will help resolve the Hubble tension.\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nThe inclusion of a Data Availability Statement is a requirement for articles published in MNRAS.

            "text": "In the appendix, we show the results of the another four strongly lensed quasar systems, namely HE 0435-1223, SDSS 1206+4332, WFI 2033-4723 and PG 1115+080. The time delays of these systems do not differ much from each other. Since we are lack of the sufficient information to model these 4 systems, we directly use the publicly available simulation results of \ud835\udf05, \ud835\udefe and \ud835\udc53\u2217 of them. In this case, we do not need to generate the lens images and can directly simulate the light-curves. Instead of using the PSF photometry, here we use the analytical method to calculate the photometric magnitudes and errors. The generation of intrinsic light-curves follows Section 3.1 with CAR process. \ud835\udf0f and \ud835\udf0e are set to 300 and 0.01, respectively. ?\u0304? of each image corresponds to observed magnitudes from CASTLES and Gaia7. We adopt previous measurements Millon et al. (2020c); Bonvin et al. (2018, 2019); Birrer et al. (2019) as true delays of these light-curves. Several important parameters (\ud835\udf05, \ud835\udefe, \ud835\udc53\u2217) for microlensing magnification maps are listed in Table A1 and are used to generate microlensing effect as 3.3. The photometric error is calculated through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is defined as SNR = \ud835\udc41star\u221a\ufe02\n\ud835\udc41star + \ud835\udc5bpix ( \ud835\udc41sky + \ud835\udc452readout ) =\n\ud835\udc5bstar\ud835\udc61obs\u221a\ufe02 \ud835\udc5bstar\ud835\udc61obs + \ud835\udc5bpix ( \ud835\udc5bsky\ud835\udc61obs + \ud835\udc452readout ) . (A1) Then, we convert it into the photometric error in magnitudes Howell (2006)\n\ud835\udf0e = 1.0857/SNR, (A2)\nwhere \ud835\udc5bpix is the number of pixels covered by the image, mainly determined by seeing. The value of 1.0857 is the correction term between an error in flux (electrons) and that same error in magnitudes. We normally distribute random values with zero mean and standard deviation from Eq. (A2) onto the brightness images. Frankly speaking, the error given in Eq. (A2) is a bit optimistic and one can take this number as a face value. As a forecast paper, this number sets the upper limit of the photometry measurement of the Muztagh-Ata 1.93m telescope. Results of different observation strategies are shown in Figure A1, A2, A3 and A4. Table A2 shows the time delay measurements under the observation strategy of 3-season campaign length. The time delay measurements for these four systems can achieve good accuracy under this observation strategy.\n7 The brightness of SDSS 1206 is missing in CASTLES, so we use that of Gaia.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201316 (2021)\nTable A1.
