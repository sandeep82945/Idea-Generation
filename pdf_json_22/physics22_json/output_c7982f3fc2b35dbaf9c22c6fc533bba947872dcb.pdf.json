    "abstractText": "The strict definition of positive geometry implies that all maximal residues of its canonical form are \u00b11. We observe, however, that the loop integrand of the amplitude in planar N = 4 super Yang-Mills has maximal residues not equal to \u00b11. We find the reason for this is that deep in the boundary structure of the loop amplituhedron there are geometries which contain internal boundaries: codimension one defects separating two regions of opposite orientation. This phenomenon requires a generalisation of the concept of positive geometry and canonical form to include such internal boundaries and also suggests the utility of a further generalisation to \u2018weighted positive geometries\u2019. We re-examine the deepest cut of N = 4 amplitudes in light of this and obtain new all order residues. Copyright G. Dian et al.

            "text": "The amplituhedron is a geometrical object introduced in [1, 2] and was discovered to yield a beautiful intrinsic definition of the perturbative expansion of planar amplitudes in N = 4 super Yang-Mills (SYM), allowing for entirely novel expressions for amplitudes to be found (see [3] for a review). In this framework, amplitude integrands are obtained as a differential form, called the canonical form, of the amplituhedron. The boundary structure of the amplituhedron then encodes the full singularity structure of the integrand. More precisely, residues of the amplitude are the canonical forms of the corresponding amplituhedron boundaries, which recursively give further residues as boundaries of the boundaries etc. Thus the amplituhedron provides a fascinating way to analyse the singularity structure of amplitude integrands, which in turn is intimately connected to the branch cut structure of the integrated amplitude [4,5]. In this paper, we investigate multiple residues of amplitudes and the corresponding amplituhedron boundary structure. In particular, we point out new features which have not been appreciated previously.\nFirst, we note that a direct consequence of amplitudes arising from positive geometries is that the amplitude should have unit maximal residues. This arises geometrically simply from the fact that maximal residues correspond to dimension 0 geometries, ie points, which can only differ by their orientation. Tree-level amplitudes indeed appear to have unit maximal residues. The tree level superamplitudes can be computed by summing a certain set of on-shell diagrams [6] arising from the BCFW recursion relation [7]. The on-shell diagrams manifestly have only logarithmic singularities and non-vanishing maximal residues equal to \u00b11 and have a natural geometric interpretation in amplituhedron space [1]. It was recently proven that they provide a tessellation of the amplituhedron [8] and it would be interesting to see if the details of this proof can also be used to prove that the non-vanishing maximal residues only equal \u00b11.1\nWhat we will observe however is that, unlike at tree level, the maximal residues of the loop amplitude integrand take many different values in Z. Examining the corresponding geometry, the loop amplituhedron, we find starting from 2 loops that it contains a novel feature, namely internal boundaries, deep within its boundary structure and find these are the geometric source\n1It does not automatically follow since there are simple examples of geometries which can be tessellated with positive geometries but which themselves are not positive geometries, as we will see.\nof the non-unit residues. By an internal boundary we mean a codimension 1 surface separating two regions of opposite orientation, as below:\ninternal boundary:\nWe emphasise that such internal boundaries do not appear in the amplituhedron itself, but deep within its boundary structure. That is, we claim that a certain boundary component of a boundary component of a...of the amplituhedron will contain an internal boundary.\nWe find that the internal boundaries appear to be closely associated with \u2018composite singularities\u2019 (see [9]). A simple example of a composite singularity is given by 2/(z(z + x y)). This only has two factors, but when taking the residue at z = 0 the irreducible factor z + x y factorises to x y . Indeed the above is the canonical form of the ordinary looking geometry given by points in 3d satisfying z > 0, z + x y > 0, which pictured from below looks like the following:\nThis geometry contains a boundary (nearest to the viewer in the above picture) at z = 0, which is given by x y > 0; two opposite quadrants of a plane. This 2d boundary in turn has a boundary at y = 0, consisting of two 1-dimensional regions x > 0, x < 0 with opposite orientation. Finally, this 1d region contains a 0-dimensional internal boundary at x = 0. This type of structure appears in the boundaries of the loop amplituhedron, implying that the loop amplituhedron is not a \u2018positive geometry\u2019 in the sense usually understood [10].2\nThere has been tremendous progress in understanding the geometry of the tree level amplituhedron and its canonical form [8, 12\u201315]. The loop amplituhedron and its tilings on the other hand are much less well understood. A first exploration of the boundaries of the MHV loop amplituhedron was started in [2], where the 2-loop MHV amplitude was computed by triangulating the amplituhedron and several cuts were discussed. Then a systematic investigation of the boundaries of the MHV loop amplituhedron was carried out up to four loops in [16] and extended to negative mutual positivity conditions in [17]. Internal boundaries, however, appear to have been missed in the construction of the stratification of the loop amplituhedron in previous works. One possible reason for this is that these boundaries cannot be labelled by the Pl\u00fccker coordinates that are naturally used to describe the amplituhedron: \u2329Y i jkl\u232a, \u2329ABi j\u232a and \u2329AiBiA jB j\u232a. For example, internal boundaries arise when computing the all-in-one-point cut of [18] via consecutive single residues. By carefully looking at the boundary corresponding to three loop lines (A1B1), (A2B2), (A3B3) all intersecting the point A, one finds that \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a= 0 represents an internal boundary.\n2Note that maximal residues differing from \u00b11 have been observed previously in the square of the super amplitude, where they appear already at tree level [11]. In fact, there they appear in a less subtle way geometrically: the tree squared amplituhedron interior is disconnected and internal boundaries correspond to boundaries shared between the different connected components, whereas the loop amplituhedron interior is connected.\nWe conclude that we need to generalise the definition of \u2018positive geometry\u2019 to allow for such internal boundaries and to incorporate the loop amplituhedron. Thus, we define generalised positive geometries (GPGs) which include internal boundaries. Then we introduce a corresponding extension of the recursive definition of the canonical form, by adding an additional term for internal boundaries which should appear with a factor of 2. In doing so, the loop level amplitude can still be obtained as the canonical form of the amplituhedron geometry.\nIn practise, the most convenient way to compute canonical forms of positive geometries is via tessellation (eg via cylindrical decomposition) rather than explicit use of the recursive definition. It is important to note that tessellations work for these generalised positive geometries (GPGs) just as for positive geometries. The canonical form of a GPG can be computed simply by summing over the canonical forms of the tiles in a tessellation. Indeed, the space of GPGs is closed under the disjoint-union: any geometry that can be tiled in GPGs is itself a GPG. This differs from positive geometries, which are incomplete under tessellation. We will see examples of geometries that can be tessellated in positive geometries, but which are not themselves a positive geometry.\nWhile the above generalisation of positive geometry to include internal boundaries is perfectly adequate to deal with the loop amplituhedron, it immediately suggests an even more general type of geometry which may be of wider use, namely \u2018weighted positive geometry\u2019. Any oriented geometry is defined by specifying a region (the geometry) together with its orientation form. However, in order to compute the canonical form of a geometry containing internal boundaries, such as the loop amplituhedron, one needs some extra information encoding which points belong to an external boundary and which belong to an internal boundary. It then seems very natural to define a new object called the weighted geometry (WG). A WG is given by a pair (w, O), where w is an integer valued function we call the weight function and O is the orientation form. The value of the weight function on a point intuitively represents the number of coinciding oriented geometries at that point. For example, an ordinary oriented geometry X\u22650 can be described as a weighed geometry with weight function w(x) = 1 for all x \u2208 X\u22650 and zero elsewhere, while an internal boundary will have w(x) = 2 instead (an internal boundary can be viewed as two external boundaries coinciding).\nThe space of weighted geometries is naturally equipped with two key operators: a sum and a projection onto boundary. The sum generalizes the union of disconnected oriented geometries by allowing for overlaps (the weights on the overlap simply sum). The projection onto boundary operator instead allows one to define the induced weight function and orientation on the boundary of a WG. As a consequence, boundaries of WGs are WGs. This construction allows for a recursive definition of the canonical form and weighted positive geometries (WPG), that treats internal and external boundaries on the same footing and makes the tiling properties of the canonical form trivial. In fact, the canonical form turns out to be a linear operator with respect to the sum of WPGs. Then, because a tiling of a geometry X\u22650 in this new language is nothing but a sum of WPGs, it follows trivially that the canonical form of a sum (union) of WPGs is equal to the sum of the canonical forms.\nAnother feature of the geometry of the amplituhedron which seems to have not been emphasised in the literature previously is the geometrical equivalent of the fact that multiple residues are not in general uniquely defined. One way to define multiple residues is via the residue form [19] (see also [9]) which essentially defines it via a sequence of single residues. However, taking these in different orders can give completely different results. There is a direct analogue of this fact in terms of taking boundaries of the corresponding geometry. Rather than talking about codimension 2 boundary components, instead it is the precise boundary component of the boundary component which will give the multiple residue defined by taking the corresponding simple poles in sequence. Taking these boundary components in different orders can give different results.\nConsider the solid 3d geometry below, which will serve as a very simple example to illustrate the dependence on the order of taking boundaries.\nHere we have a 3d shape which looks like a house with a flat roof on the left and an angled roof on the right. The planes in which the two roofs lie intersect along the top of the front wall which we will call the \u2018front eaves\u2019. While one might wish to talk about the codimension two boundary component corresponding to the entire front eaves, taking appropriate boundaries of boundaries can give results which differ from this. One could first take the flat roof boundary component and then take the front eave boundary of that. This results in only the left half of the front eaves. If on the other hand we first take the slanted roof boundary component and then the font eaves boundary of that, we obtain the right half of the front eaves. Finally we could instead first take the boundary component on the front wall, and then the boundary component of that at the top, resulting in the entire length of the front eaves. We thus arrive at three different results from taking a sequence of boundary components.\nThis is completely consistent with what we get from multiple residues. Indeed, this example can be made completely precise and the corresponding canonical form and residues taken. We choose coordinates such that the flat roof lies on the plane z = 0, the slanted roof on y = z and the front wall y = 0 (we also put the two side walls at x = \u22121, x = 1, the back wall at y = 1 and the floor at z = \u22121). The corresponding canonical form, which can easily be obtained by summing the canonical form of the living space and the roof, is\n\u2126= 1\n(x \u2212 1)x(y \u2212 1)z(y \u2212 z) \u2212 2 (x \u2212 1)(x + 1)(y \u2212 1)yz(z + 1) . (1)\nThe residue corresponding to the front boundary of the flat roof is Resy=0Resz=0\u2126 = \u2212d x/(x(x + 1)) = \u2126[\u22121, 0], which is the canonical form of the one dimensional interval \u22121 \u2264 x \u2264 0. On the other hand, the residue corresponding to the front boundary of the slanted roof is Resy=0Resz=y\u2126 = \u2212d x/(x(x \u2212 1)) = \u2126[0,1], the canonical form of the one dimensional interval 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1. Finally, the residue corresponding to the top boundary of the front wall is Resz=0Resy=0\u2126 = 2d x/((x \u2212 1)(x + 1)) = \u2126[1,\u22121]. All cases correspond in the end to the codimension two line z = 0, y = 0 but the precise way we get there gives different results.\nAnother example of this phenomenon is the case of all l loop lines intersecting in a single point, which is a configuration closely related to the deepest cut of [18]. At 4 points, from 4 loops onward, different orderings of single residues give algebraically different results, as we will show in section 4.3. With this in mind, we do a detailed analysis of the all-in-one-point cut and find quite a complicated structure in general, although it seems one can always keep taking further loop loop residues to reduce to the 3 loop all-in-one-point-and-plane cut.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we present a simple example of a maximal residue at two loops equal to \u00b12 rather than \u00b11, and give its geometrical interpretation as an internal boundary. In section 3 we formally define generalized positive geometries (GPGs),\nwhich allow internal boundaries, and their canonical forms. We discuss tilings of GPGs and the key property that any geometry that can be triangulated by GPGs is a GPG, a property not shared by positive geometries. We describe the algebraic cylindrical decomposition algorithm, originally presented in [20], to compute the canonical form, and use it to identify a class of GPGs. Then, we introduce a generalisation of GPGs which we call weighted positive geometries. In section 4 we turn our attention to a specific boundary of the loop amplituhedron, that is the all-in-one-point cut, and we compute its geometry and discuss its internal boundary. Finally, in section 5 we take further cuts on the result of the all-in-one-point cut and obtain a new all loop formula."

The bracket notation denotes the determinant of the 4\u00d74 matrix formed by taking the four twistors inside as columns. We also surpress the Zs, so eg \u2329A1B112\u232a := det(A1, B1, Z1, Z2).\nNow we compute the multi-residue corresponding to taking a sequence of residues on\n\u2329A1B112\u232a= 0 , \u2329A1B134\u232a= 0 , \u2329A2B212\u232a= 0 , \u2329A2B234\u232a= 0, \u2329A1B1A2B2\u232a= 0 , (3)\nfollowed by a residue on a hidden pole which appears at \u232912B1B2\u232a = 0. To do this we first parametrise the 4\u00d74 Z = (Z1Z2Z3Z4) matrix as the identity and the loops as\nAi Bi = 1 ai 0 \u2212bi 0 ci 1 di . (4)\nFor this choice, the brackets read\n\u2329AiBi12\u232a= bi , \u2329AiBi23\u232a= di , \u2329AiBi34\u232a= ci , \u2329AiBi14\u232a= ai , \u2329A1B1A2B2\u232a= \u2212(b1 \u2212 b2)(c1 \u2212 c2)\u2212 (a1 \u2212 a2)(d1 \u2212 d2) , \u23291234\u232a= 1 , (5)\n\u2329AiBid2Ai\u232a\u2329AiBid2Bi\u232a= daidbidciddi .\nOmitting the differentials, the amplitude (2) in these coordinates reads\nMHV(2) = \u2212 a2d1 + a1d2 + b2c1 + b1c2\na1a2 b1 b2c1c2d1d2 ((a1 \u2212 a2) (d1 \u2212 d2) + (b1 \u2212 b2) (c1 \u2212 c2)) . (6)\nNow we take the first four residues in (3), namely b1 = 0, c1 = 0, b2 = 0, c2 = 0. We see that the complicated factor in the denominator factorises thus revealing a new pole,3 giving\n\u2212 a2d1 + a1d2\na1a2d1d2 (a1 \u2212 a2) (d1 \u2212 d2) .

See also the example in the introduction.\nThen we take the residue in a1 at a1 = a2, obtaining\n\u2212 (d1 + d2)\na2d1d2 (d1 \u2212 d2) . (8)\nWe continue by taking the residue in d1 at d1 = d2, obtaining\n\u2212 2\na2d2 , (9)\nup to an overall sign due to the ordering of the differential d2aid 2 bid 2cid 2di . From (9), it is clear that this form has maximal residues equal to \u00b12, contradicting the consequence of this being the canonical form of a positive geometry.\nGeometrical interpretation\nLet\u2019s try to understand how this factor of two appears geometrically from the amplituhedron. First we take boundaries corresponding to the four residues at {\u2329A1B112\u232a = 0, \u2329A1B134\u232a = 0, \u2329A2B212\u232a = 0, \u2329A2B234\u232a = 0}. The order in which these are performed is not important and the resulting geometry has each loop line (AiBi) described by a point Ai in the segment 12 and a point Bi in 34, together with a further mutual positivity condition \u2329A1B1A2B2\u232a > 0. It is natural then to parametrise Ai , Bi as Ai = Z1 + ai Z2 and Bi = Z3 + di Z4, so that the geometry is described by the inequalities\nai > 0 , di > 0 , \u2212(a1 \u2212 a2)(d1 \u2212 d2)> 0 . (10)\nNotice that the mutual positivity inequality factorizes in to the product of two terms a1 > a2, d1 < d2 or a1 < a2, d1 > d2. This is just the geometrical version of composite residues mentioned in the introduction and above (7). The factorisation results in a corresponding geometry given by two regions\nR1 := {a1, a2, d1, d2 | a1 > a2 > 0\u2227 d2 > d1 > 0} , R2 := {a1, a2, d1, d2 | a2 > a1 > 0\u2227 d1 > d2 > 0} .\n(11)\nThis geometry is illustrated in the following picture,\nR1\nR2\n\u2022\n(12)\nwhere the x axis corresponds to increasing a1 \u2212 a2 and the y axis increasing d2 \u2212 d1. The two regions share only a codimension 2 boundary that is contained on the surface (a1 \u2212 a2) = 0, (d1 \u2212 d2) = 0. Both regions R1,R2 come equipped with an orientation induced by the bulk geometry, which in this case is the same for both regions. Each of the two regions is clearly a positive geometry, with canonical forms\n\u2126(R1) = \u2212 1\na1d2(a1 \u2212 a2)(d1 \u2212 d2) ,\n\u2126(R2) = \u2212 1\na2d1(a2 \u2212 a1)(d2 \u2212 d1) .\n(13)\nThe sum of these correctly reproduces the corresponding residue of the amplitude (7). Since the two regions share a lower codimension boundary we have to see what happens on this boundary to decide if the union is or isn\u2019t a positive geometry. We can consider for example the (d2\u2212d1) = 0 boundary by sending d2\u2192 d1. This corresponds to projecting onto the x axis of (12) and thus looks as\n\u2022 R\u20321R\n\u2032 2 (14)\nWe again get two regions\nR\u20321 := {a1, a2, d1 | d1 > 0\u2227 a1 > a2 > 0} , R\u20322 := {a1, a2, d1 | d1 > 0\u2227 a2 > a1 > 0} , (15)\nbut since we approach the boundary from two different directions, the two induced orientations are opposite (see appendix A for a detailed explanation). The region R\u20321 and R\u20322 share a codimension 1 boundary (a1 \u2212 a2) = 0 where the orientation changes sign. We call this an internal boundary.\nWe see that this boundary is in fact not oriented (rather it flips orientation on the internal boundary a1 = a2). Part of the definition of positive geometry in [10] is that it is oriented and, by the recursive nature of the definition, so are all boundaries etc. We conclude that a generalisation of the concept of positive geometry is needed to accommodate the loop amplituhedron.\nSince both R\u20321 and R\u20322 by themselves are positive geometries on the other hand, their respective residues at (a2 \u2212 a1) = 0 are equal to the canonical form of this. Therefore the residue on the internal boundary of \u2126(R\u20321)+\u2126(R\u20322) will be equal to twice the canonical form of a positive geometry. Note that if R\u20321 and R \u2032 2 instead had the same orientation as each other then (a2 \u2212 a1) = 0 would be a spurious boundary and the resulting residue would vanish. We have thus seen that the loop amplitude has non-unit maximal residues and the geometrical origin of this is that the amplituhedron contains internal boundaries. In the next section we will see how to formalize what we have observed in this simple example and generalize the definition of the canonical form to geometries with internal boundaries, which will then accommodate the loop amplituhedron."

A positive geometry X\u22650 is an oriented region in some space (an algebraic variety) whose boundary consists of a set of positive geometries of one dimension less, with their orientation inherited from that of the neighbouring bulk geometry. Each component in this set lies inside some region of the form f (x i) = 0 for some non-factorisable polynomial f . Then the associated canonical form, \u2126, of X\u22650 is related to the associated canonical form, \u03c9, of this boundary component via the residue form on f (x i) = 0\nd f \u2227Res f=0\u2126= lim f\u21920 f \u2126= d f \u2227\u03c9 . (16)\nSince the dimension of the boundary component f = 0 is one dimension less than the dimension of X , this gives a recursive definition which stops when we reach dimension 0 positive geometries, which are just single points. These points are then defined to have canonical form \u00b11 according to their orientation inherited from the original geometry. In the appendix A we review how the induced orientation is defined and the convention we use for the signs.\nApart from the 0-dimensional oriented points, the simplest examples of positive geometries are 1-dimensional. The most general 1d positive geometry is a disjoint union of intervals of arbitrary orientation. The canonical form of the interval from a to b is\n[a, b] = \u2022 a\n\u2022 b \u2126([a, b]) = d x x \u2212 b \u2212 d x x \u2212 a . (17)\nThe boundaries of this segment are given by f (x) = x \u2212 b = 0 and f (x) = x \u2212 a = 0, and we see from (16) that b has canonical form 1 and a has canonical form -1. The canonical form of the disjoint union of such intervals is simply the sum of the canonical forms of the intervals.\nNotice that two intervals of the same orientation which share a common boundary point are equivalent to the larger interval\n[a, b]\u222a [b, c] = \u2022 a\n\u2022 b \u2022 c =\n\u2022 a \u2022 c (18)\nwith the shared boundary point absent. This is reflected in the addition of the corresponding canonical forms\n\u2126([a, b]) +\u2126([b, c]) = \u2126([a, c]) . (19)\nIn this case, the point b is sometimes called a spurious boundary. However, two intervals of different orientations sharing a common boundary point\n[a, b]\u222a [c, b] = \u2022 a\n\u2022 b \u2022 c (20)\ndoes not constitute a positive geometry (for example, it is not oriented). Nevertheless, it is natural to associate to this geometry the corresponding canonical form\n\u2126([a, b]) +\u2126([c, b]) = 2 d x\nx \u2212 b \u2212 d x x \u2212 a \u2212 d x x \u2212 c . (21)\nThe point b is then special, separating two regions of opposite orientation, and we refer to this as an \u2018internal boundary\u2019. It has residue twice that of each of the two individual boundaries there. This is exactly what we observed occurring for the two loop amplitude in the previous section."

            "text": "The discussion above motivates a generalisation of the concept of positive geometry to incorporate internal boundaries. Internal boundaries separate two regions of opposite orientation. So, we define a generalised positive geometry as one whose internal and external boundaries are both generalised positive geometries. Both external and internal boundaries must lie inside a space defined by f (x i) = 0 for some non-factorisable polynomial f . A particular subspace f (x i) = 0 could contain both internal and external boundaries, each of which must be a (generalised) positive geometry with canonical form \u03c9int and \u03c9ext respectively. Then we define the canonical form recursively as\nRes f=0\u2126=\u03c9ext + 2\u03c9int , (22)\nor equivalently, lim f\u21920 f \u2126 = d f \u2227 (\u03c9ext + 2\u03c9int) . (23)\nWe see an extra term compared to the original canonical form for positive geometries (16), giving the factor of 2 associated with internal boundaries. The starting point for the recursion is the same as before; the 0-dimensional geometries, oriented points, with canonical form \u00b11 according to their orientation. Note that the orientation of the interior boundary is unambiguously inherited from that of the bulk just as for the exterior boundaries.\nSo consider the 1d example in (20). This has external boundaries (with negative orientation) at fa(x) = x \u2212 a = 0 and fc(x) = x \u2212 c = 0 and an internal boundary with positive orientation at fb(x) = x \u2212 b = 0. One can see that the canonical form (21) satisfies the recursive relation (22) at all three points.\nNow consider a 2d example.\nR1 =\n(24)\nHere the x axis contains both an external boundary and an internal boundary. The canonical form can be obtained straightforwardly by simply adding together the canonical forms of the two triangles,4 giving\n\u2126(R1) = d x d y\nx y(x + y \u2212 1) + 2d x d y y(x + y + 1)(x \u2212 y \u2212 1) . (25)\nNow we can see how this satisfies the recursive definition (22) along the x axis. Taking the residue of (25) at y = 0 gives\nResy=0\u2126= d x 1 x \u2212 1 x+1 +2d x 1 x\u22121 \u2212 1 x = \u2126([\u22121, 0]) + 2\u2126([0, 1]) , (26)\nwhich is exactly as predicted by (22) with f = y since the external boundary on the x axis is the interval [\u22121,0] and the internal boundary is [0,1].\nNote that internal boundaries give a contribution to the canonical form of twice that of a standard external boundary. One might think therefore that a leading singularity of any such a generalised positive geometry must be 0,\u00b11 (as for a positive geometry) or \u00b12 if there is an internal boundary present. However, there can be internal boundaries inside internal boundaries, leading to higher maximal residues. A very simple example of this is the region\n4This key tessellation feature of positive geometries and the canonical forms is inherited by (and is indeed more powerful for) the generalised positive geometries as we will see.\nconsisting of the entire plane, but with the four quadrants having alternating orientations\nR2 =\n(27)\nHere, each quadrant has exactly the same canonical form d x d y/(x y) and so the geometry has non-zero canonical form\n\u2126(R2) = 4d x d y\nx y . (28)\nTaking the residue on the (internal) boundary x = 0 gives lim x\u21920 (x\u2126) = 2d x \u2227 2d y y = 2d x \u2227\u03c9int with\u03c9int = 2d y\ny , satisfying (22). Here the internal boundary in x = 0 is (\u2212\u221e, 0)\u222a(\u221e, 0) and this itself has an internal boundary at y = 0. Thus it has canonical form 2d yy (as we get directly from (21) by taking b\u2192 0, a, c\u2192\u221e and x \u2192 y). So the leading singularity at x = y = 0 is 4.\nIt is also possible to get a leading singularity 3. Simply take three of the four quadrants from the previous example\nR3 =\n(29)\nThis geometry has canonical form\n\u2126(R2) = 3d x d y\nx y . (30)\nHere taking the residue on the boundary x = 0 gives limx\u21920(x\u2126) = d x \u2227 d y y + 2d x \u2227 d y y in agreement with (22). This time x = 0 contains the external boundary (\u2212\u221e, 0) as well as the internal boundary (0,\u221e) both of which have canonical forms d yy . Therefore, the leading singularity at x = 0 then y = 0 is 3.\nNote that in [11], in the context of the squared amplituhedron, another generalisation of positive geometry was considered, and the associated canonical form called the globally oriented canonical form was defined. These geometries are in fact also examples of GPGs and we discuss this relation in more detail in appendix B."

            "text": "Although the definition of the canonical form (22) is extremely compact, it has the downside of treating external and internal boundaries on a different footing. On the right hand side we\nhave a weighted sum of canonical forms, so it\u2019s tempting to rewrite this as the canonical form of a weighted sum of geometries. In this section we make this intuition precise by generalising what we mean by a geometrical region slightly, to include a weight taking arbitrary integer values. This articulates the idea of having multiple coinciding geometries which we naturally have when two regions meet on an internal boundary. This concept will allow us to give an explicit formula for maximal residues.\nFirstly, recall that orientation on a space can be described by a top form where we are only really interested in the sign of the top form. So orientation is the equivalence class of real top forms modulo positive rescaling, O \u2208 \u2126d/ \u223c where O \u223c \u03bbO for any \u03bb > 0. Now we extend this to define the weighted orientation as a pair (w, O) : X \u2192 Z,\u2126d(X )\n/ \u223c where here the equivalence relation involves positive or negative rescaling with the negative case also flipping the weight w\n(w, O)\u223c (sign(\u03bb)w,\u03bbO\u2032) , \u03bb \u0338= 0 . (31)\nThus changing the orientation is equivalent to flipping the sign of w. In practise we can of course always choose coset representatives of (31) such that w> 0 and we will mostly assume this from now on.\nWeighted geometries have a natural additive structure. At any point x \u2208 X we define the sum of two weighted geometries (w1, O1)\u2295 (w2, O2) as\n(w1, O1)\u2295 (w2, O2) = (w1 + sign(\u03bb)w2, O1) , (32)\nwhere \u03bb is such that O1 = \u03bbO2.5 Notice, that because of (31) this sum is symmetric and the identity element (0, O) is unique.\nSo now we define a weighted geometry entirely by specifying its weight function and its orientation, rather than directly defining a region X\u2265. The region X\u2265 can be reconstructed by simply defining it as the set of points where w \u0338= 0. Boundaries are then places where the weighted orientation is discontinuous and they divide regions inside which the weighted orientation is continuous (and therefore w is constant). We will shortly define a canonical form for weighted geometries, the existence and uniqueness of which will define weighted positive geometries (WPG). For multivariate residues to be well defined, we insist that these boundaries must be subsets of algebraic varieties \u2013 so these regions are semi-algebraic sets.\nA key aspect of this construction is that both weights and orientation on the boundaries are uniquely induced from those in the bulk. This happens as follows. Any boundary component, C can be defined through a polynomial p(x) = 0. Then one side of the boundary is p(x) > 0, with weight and orientation (w+, O+), whereas the other side is p(x)< 0 with (w\u2212, O\u2212). Now the region p(x)> 0 naturally induces the orientation O+|C on the boundary of the region p > 0 in the standard way (see appendix A), so O+ = dp \u2227O+|C . The region p(x) < 0 on the other hand naturally induces the orientation O\u2212|C on the boundary, where O\u2212 = \u2212dp \u2227O\u2212|C .6\nGiven a codimension-1 variety C \u2208 X , then we define a projection operator \u03a0C that maps weighted orientations (w, O) on X to weighted orientations on C as\n\u03a0C(w, O) = (w +|C , O+|C)\u2295 (w\u2212|C , O\u2212|C) . (33)\nChoosing representatives such that w> 0, we can give the following two dimensional illustra-\n5Note that the x dependence is suppressed in the equation and that the function sign(\u03bb(x)) is negative if the two orientations O1(x) and O2(x) are opposite and positive if they match.\n6The minus sign arises from the fact that the normal vector pointing inward the region p < 0 is \u2212\u2202p.\ntion of the induced weights and orientations (denoted with arrows):\nw\nw\u2032\nw\nw\u2032\nw\nw\u2032\nw+w\u2032 w\u2212w\u2032 w\u2032\u2212w\n(w> w\u2032) (w< w\u2032)\n(34)\nNote that w or w\u2032 could have been zero in which case we have a conventional external boundary. This definition implies that, for w(x) = 1 in X>0 and 0 otherwise, w|C will be equal to 2 on internal boundaries, to 1 on external boundaries and 0 otherwise. In this formulation internal and external boundaries are not distinguished. Furthermore note that if w+ = w\u2212 and \u03bb < 0 then there are equivalent weighted orientations on both sides (meaning the induced orientations are opposite) and thus there is no genuine boundary there (it is a spurious boundary).\nAn important observation now is that the projection \u03a0 is a linear operator\n\u03a0C (w1, O1)\u2295 (w2, O2) = \u03a0C(w1, O1)\u2295\u03a0C(w2, O2) , (35)\nwhich can be easily proven from the definitions. Now we can define a weighted positive geometry as a weighted geometry possessing a canonical form. The definition of the canonical form of a weighted geometry is defined recursively such that the residue of the canonical form on C is the canonical form of the geometry projected on C:\nResC\u2126(w, O) = \u2126(\u03a0C(w, O)) . (36)\nThe recursion starts by defining the canonical form of a zero dimensional weighted geometry (for which O is a 0 form, simply a scalar) as the product of w with the sign of O\n\u2126(w, O) = w sign(O) (In zero dimensions) . (37)\nIn zero dimensions therefore the canonical form is a linear operator\n\u2126 (w1, O1)\u2295 (w2, O2) = \u2126 w1 + sign(\u03bb)w2, O1 = (w1 + sign(\u03bb)w2)\u00d7 sign(O1)\n= w1sign(O1) +w2sign(O2) = \u2126(w1, O1) +\u2126(w2, O2) , (38)\nwhere recall O1 = \u03bbO2. It follows by induction from the recursive definition (36) and linearity of the projection operator \u03a0 (35) that this linearity property of \u2126 then holds for spaces of arbitrary dimension:\n\u2126 (w1, O1)\u2295 (w2, O2) = \u2126(w1, O1) +\u2126(w2, O2) . (39)\nRemarkably we have the feature that we can freely sum arbitrary (even overlapping) WPGs! It also follows directly from this that\n\u2126 (\u03bbw, O) = \u03bb\u2126(w, O) . (40)\nNow given a sequence of boundaries {C1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,Cn}, we can follow n steps of the recursion (36) and write the multi-residue of a canonical form as the canonical form of the multiply induced boundary\nResC1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn\u2126(w, O) = \u2126(\u03a0C1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn(w, O)) . (41)\nThen taking n = d, the dimension of X , we obtain an expression for the maximal residues in terms of the canonical form at a point (37)\nResC1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cd\u2126(w, O) = wC1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cd \u00d7 sign OC1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cd , (42)\nwhere (wC1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cd , OC1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cd ) = \u03a0C1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cd (w, O). This last equation can also be used as a direct, non-recursive, definition of the canonical form by giving all its maximal residues (the canonical form is completely determined by its maximal residues).\nNote that generalised positive geometries, defined in previous subsections, should simply be WPGs for which the weight function (in the bulk) is w = \u00b11,0 everywhere. Similarly positive geometries are WPGs for which the weight function w = \u00b11, 0 everywhere (so they are also GPGs) but also the induced weight function on all nested boundary components is also always \u00b11, 0.\nTo check this we need to show that the canonical form for the GPGs defined by (22) and that for the WPGs (36) are equivalent. By equivalent we mean that given any GPG X\u22650 with orientation O we associate a weighted geometry with orientation O and weight w such that w(x) = 1 for all x \u2208 X\u22650 and zero otherwise, and then\n\u2126(X\u22650) = \u2126(w, O) . (43)\nNow notice that the projection of (w, O) onto C (described in (33) and above) will have induced weight 1 or 2, depending on whether it is an external or internal boundary. So we can write \u03a0C(w, O) = (wext, Oext)\u2295(wint, Oint)where wext = 1 on external boundaries and zero elsewhere whereas wint = 2 on internal boundaries and zero elsewhere. Then, it follows that if we apply (36) we get\nResC\u2126(w, O) = \u2126 \u03a0C(w, O) = \u2126((wext, Oext)\u2295 (wint, Oint)) = \u2126(wext, Oext) + 2\u2126 wint\n2 , Oint . (44)\nNow since wext and 1 2 wint are both functions respectively equal to 1 on internal and external boundaries and equal to 0 otherwise, they represent with their orientations the external and internal boundaries as GPGs. This is then precisely the original defining equation of the canonical form (22). Since we showed that the recursion (36) and (22) have the same form it follows that the two definitions of the canonical form give the same result.\nFinally, let us illustrate with a slightly more involved example, returning to the case considered in (29) from this new perspective\nR3 =\n11\n10\n2\n1\n21\n(45)\nHere we see the induced weights 2,1 on the codimension 1 boundaries x = 0, y = 0. Considering these boundaries themselves they then induce the weight 2 + 1 = 3 at the origin with positive orientation on the y axis, negative on the x axis. This is in line with (42) and the corresponding maximal residue Resy=0,x=0\u2126R3 = \u2212Resx=0,y=0\u2126R3 = 3.\nNote that in [10] a generalisation of positive geometries was defined, the Grothendieck group of pseudo-positive geometries, consisting of the formal sum of positive geometries modded out by geometries with vanishing canonical form. The Grothendieck group of pseudopositive geometries and the WPGs are closely related but different. The Grothendieck group\nof pseudo-positive geometries is presumably equivalent to the space of WPGs after modding out by elements with zero canonical form. This equivalence relation implies that\n\u2126((w1, O1)) = \u2126((w2, O2)) \u21d2 (w1, O1)\u223c (w2, O2) . (46)"

Since holomorphic forms have no poles, they could be added to any canonical form to obtain a new canonical form satisfying all the requirements and thus we would not have a unique canonical form. Conversely, under the assumption that GPGs/WPGs have no holomorphic forms, we can proceed by induction assuming that the canonical form in d\u22121 dimensions is always unique. Consider two canonical forms \u21261,\u21262 for the same GPG or WPG. By definition, both forms have poles only on the boundary components. The residue on a boundary component is the canonical form of the boundary component, by the recursive definition of the canonical form.

(47)\nHowever it can happen that a non positive geometry can be triangulated by positive geometries - so the space of positive geometries is not closed under the union. This is because even if the orientation of the X (i)\u22650 tiling X\u22650 matches on codimension 1 boundaries this does not imply that they will necessarily match on the boundaries of boundaries etc. This can then give rise to internal boundaries.

Thus the space of GPGs is closed under the disjoint-union. This is essentially trivial from linearity of the WPG canonical form and the definition of a GPG as a WPG with weight 0,\u00b11 everywhere.\nA beautiful consequence of the WPG formalism is that it also yields a simple proof of the tiling property of positive geometries (47). Indeed this follows trivially from the fact that the canonical form is a linear operator for weighted positive geometries (39). Translating (47) into WPG language, on the right hand side we have the canonical form of a region which is equivalently a weight function (w, O) with w= 1 in the region and 0 outside. This region has a tesellation with tiles (wi , Oi) with\n(w, O) = \u2295\ni\n(wi , Oi) . (49)\nNow linearity of WPGs give\n\u2126(w, O) = \u2211\ni\n\u2126(wi , Oi) , (50)\nwhich proves (47)."

            "text": "In the previous subsection we gave an implicit (recursive) definition of generalised positive geometry and weighted positive geometries. Here we consider whether it is possible to give more explicit characterisations, so we can know in advance if a particular region is a GPG/WPG or not. The fact that GPGs/WPGs are closed under union (or sum for WPGs) as discussed in the previous subsection already suggests they ought to be more amenable to a direct characterisation than PGs. For example any characterisation of PGs would have to exclude the two examples in (48).\nWe first note that if we restrict ourselves to a specific class of geometry which we call multi-linear geometries then the characterisation is very simple. Multi-linear geometries are geometries defined by multi-linear inequalities in some coordinates. Note that although this may be a big restriction of the full space of positive geometries it nevertheless provides a very wide class of cases. Crucially it is straightforward to see that the amplituhedron is a multilinear geometry. The defining inequalities of the amplituhedron are given in terms of either minors of a C matrix, or alternatively determinants of the form \u2329Y Li ...\u232a. Thus by choosing components of either the C matrix, and/or the Y, Li as coordinates, the resulting inequalities will be multi-linear in those coordinates (simply because the determinant is a multi-linear function of its components).\nNote here that it is important not to confuse multi-linear geometries with linear geometries. Many of the toy examples one considers are linear geometries where defining inequalities can be given which are linear in all variables. These then have straight edges, flat planes etc. Multi-linear geometries can however be curvey. For example in 2d, boundaries of multi-linear geometries have the form ax y + bx + c y + d = 0 (in some coordinates) which correspond to hyperbolas as well as straight lines. On the other hand circles or ellipses would include the non multi-linear terms x2, y2 and are not multi-linear. They can however be boundaries of positive geometries [10]. We will shortly return to this point.\nWe first claim that any multi-linear geometry is a (generalised) positive geometry. We can show this by explicitly and uniquely computing the canonical form for multi-linear geometries. Given a multi-linear geometry, first use cylindrical decomposition (see also [20]) which recasts\nany region as a disjoint union of regions Ri of the form\nRi := {x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xd} , st\n\n   \n   \na1 < x1 < b1 ,\na2(x1)< x2 < b2(x1) , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nad(x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xd\u22121)< xd < bd(x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xd\u22121) ,\n(51)\nfor some functions a j , b j . Now changing variables to:\nx \u2032j = \u2212 x j \u2212 a j x j \u2212 b j , (52)\nthen Ri becomes\nRi := {x \u20321, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , x \u2032 d} , st x \u2032 j > 0 , for all j . (53)\nIn the new coordinates Ri is thus a simplex-like positive geometry with canonical form\n\u2126(Ri) = d \u220f\nj=1\nd x \u2032j x \u2032j . (54)\nBut as discussed in [10] under a rational map the canonical forms map to each other. So as long as the change of variables (52) is rational then we have that in the original coordinates\n\u2126(Ri) = d \u220f\nj=1\n1 x j\u2212a j \u2212 1 x j\u2212b j d x j , (55)\nand the canonical form of the full region can then be obtained by summing the contributions from all the Ri . We see how multi-linearity is crucial here. The inequalities in (51) must arise from the defining inequalities of our region which are multi-linear. This ensures that the resulting functions ai and bi will be rational functions and thus the change of variables (52) is rational.\nLet us illustrate some of these points now with a couple of examples shown in figure 1.\nFirstly we have a region R1 sandwiched between a hyperbola and a line. It is defined by the inequalities x > 0, x y > 7, x + y < 8. Cylindrical decomposition rewrites this as a single\nregion written in the form of (51) as 1< x < 7 7x < y < 8\u2212 x . Then the simple replacement rule of (55) yields the canonical form\n\u2126(R1) = d x x \u2212 1 \u2212 d x x \u2212 7\nd y\ny \u2212 7x \u2212\nd y x + y \u2212 8 = \u2212 6 d x d y (x + y \u2212 8)(x y \u2212 7) . (56)\nThe second example R2, found in [10], is not a multi-linear geometry. This is the region between a circle and a line and is defined by the inequalities x2+ y2 < 1, y > 1/10. Let us see what happens if we attempt the same procedure to obtain its canonical form. Here cylindrical decomposition rewrites the region as\n\u2212 3 p\n11 10\n< x < 3 p\n11 10 , 1 10 < y < p 1\u2212 x2 . (57)\nBut now we encounter a problem. We see that, due to the square root p\n1\u2212 x2, the change of variables needed in (52) will no longer be rational and the above procedure no longer works.\nSo we have seen that cylindrical decomposition gives the unique canonical form as long as all the resulting functions ai , bi in (51) are rational. This is clearly the case for multi-linear geometries, but could also be the case for more general geometries. Further it may be possible to change coordinates so that only in the new coordinates the cylindrical decomposition map (52) is rational. So in general we can characterise generalised positive geometries to be those for which there exist coordinates and an ordering of these coordinates such that cylindrical decomposition yields a map (52) which is rational.\nFor example let us return to the region R2 in figure 1 for which the cylindrical decomposition method of obtaining the canonical form didn\u2019t work as it produces an irrational map (52). Now the circle is the classic example of a rational variety. This is a variety that has a parametrisation t i in terms of which its embedding coordinates x i(t j) are rational functions and there is a rational inverse map t i(x j). In this case it has a rational parametrisation given by\nx(t) = 2t\n1+ t2 , y(t) =\n1\u2212 t2 1+ t2 , (58)\nwith an inverse map from R onto the circle embedded in R2 which is also rational\nt(x , y) = x\n1+ y . (59)\nHere the parameter t has the geometrical interpretation of the projection of a point on the circle, from the point (0,\u22121) to the x axis. But this projection can clearly be extended to any point in R2 not just those points on the circle. So consider the change of variables from x to t, (t, y)\u2192 (x , y) = (t(1+ y), y). In the new variables the region R2 then has cylindrical decomposition\n\u2212 3 p\n11 < t <\n3 p\n11 , 1 10 < y <\n1\u2212 t2 t2 + 1 , (60)\nwhich is now rational. The replacement rule (55), then gives the canonical form\n\u2126(R2) = \u2212 6 p\n11d t d y (10y \u2212 1) (t2(y + 1) + y \u2212 1)\n= \u2212 6 p\n11d xd y (10y \u2212 1) (x2 + y2 \u2212 1) , (61)\nwhich is in precise agreement with the canonical form for this geometry found in [10] (see figure 1) using the recursive definition of the canonical form.\nIn general, if a codimension 1 boundary of a region is a rational variety, then changing coordinates from x i to t i , xn will rationalise the final step in the cylindrical decomposition involving that boundary. In other words cylindrical decomposition in those variables will give the boundary in the form xn < xn(t i) which is a rational function as we saw in the above example which gave y < y(t) = (1\u2212t2)/(1+t2)). This all suggests there should be a more intrinsic definition of a GPG/WPG in terms of rational varieties."

This provides another example of an internal boundary as well as illustrating the other important point mentioned in the introduction, namely that the order of taking residues (or going to boundaries) can yield completely different results.\nIn general the deepest cut places all internal propagators on-shell\n(AB)\u03b1(AB)\u03b2 = 0 , \u2200 \u03b1,\u03b2 = 1, ..., l , (62)\nwhile leaving all external propagators \u2329(AB)\u03b1ii + 1\u232a generic. Geometrically there are two possible final configurations which solve (62): first, all loop lines passing through a single point A, or second, all loop lines lying on the same plane. In [18] the canonical form corresponding to these two solutions was found at any loop order. We find that this form can not be reproduced from any sequence of single residues (or any linear combination of such) acting on the amplitude and so some more complicated operation is presumably needed to reproduce it.8 Furthermore there are many inequivalent ways of approaching this final all-in-one-point configuration via different sequences of single residues, as becomes especially apparent starting at four loops. In this section we systematically investigate all cuts ending in the all-in-one-point configuration.\nWe will begin by discussing the three loop all-in-one-point cut, computing its geometry and discussing the internal boundary that arises, before considering higher loops. Although we will limit the discussion to the 4-point MHV amplituhedron geometry, the derivation of the geometry is completely independent of the tree level inequalities \u2329Y i jkl\u232a and \u2329ABi j\u232a. The results obtained in section 4.3 for the loop-loop inequalities of the all-in-one-point cut hold for any multiplicity and any NMHV degree by simply promoting the brackets \u2329ABiB jBk\u232a to \u2329YABiB jBk\u232a."

We will return to this in section 5.1.\nWe thus turn to three loops. The integrand of the three-loop MHV amplitude is given by\nMHV(3)=\n\u220f3 i=1\u2329AiBid 2Ai\u232a\u2329AiBid2Bi\u232a\u23291234\u232a3\n\u2329A1B114\u232a\u2329A1B112\u232a\u2329A1B134\u232a\u2329A2B212\u232a\u2329A2B223\u232a\u2329A3B334\u232a\u2329A1B1A3B3\u232a\u2329A2B2A3B3\u232a\n\u00d7 1 2 \u23291234\u232a \u2329A3B312\u232a\u2329A2B234\u232a + \u2329A1B123\u232a \u2329A3B323\u232a\u2329A1B1A2B2\u232a + symmetry .\n(63)\n8We thank Nima Arkani-Hamed and Jaroslav Trnka for valuable discussions on this point.\nHere the \u2018+ symmetry\u2019 is a sum of 23 more terms: the 3! terms generated by permutation symmetry over the loop variables (simultaneous permutation of Ai and Bi) together with the four terms from cyclic symmetry of the external twistors, giving 24 terms in total in the sum. The first term in square brackets is the three-loop ladder integrand, and after summing it generates 12 unique terms (all with coefficient 1), while the second term is the so-called 3- loop \u2018tennis court\u2019 diagram generating 24 unique terms (again all will have coefficient 1).\nIn order to achieve an all-in-one-point final configuration \u2013 with three loop lines passing through a single point A \u2013 we must take three residues at \u2329AiBiA jB j\u232a = 0 (62). By inspection, one can see that the first term in square brackets in (63) (the ladder integral) does not contain all three poles \u2329AiBiA jB j\u232a and therefore vanishes after taking these residues. From this point forward then we will only concern ourselves with the second term.\nThe key factor which all surviving terms contain is\nF =\n\u220f3 i=1\u2329AiBid 2Ai\u232a\u2329AiBid2Bi\u232a \u2329A1B1A2B2\u232a\u2329A2B2A3B3\u232a\u2329A1B1A3B3\u232a . (64)\nWe will then first consider the residue at \u2329A1B1A2B2\u232a = 0 followed by \u2329A1B1A3B3\u232a = 0. This corresponds geometrically to first intersecting the line A2B2 with A1B1 and then A3B3 with A1B1 (see 2). To do this, we parametrise A2 and A3 as\nA2 = A1 + a2B1 + b2Z\u2217 , A3 = A1 + a3B1 + b3Z\u2217 , (65)\nwhere Z\u2217 is an arbitrary twistor. In this parametrisation, the limits b2 \u2192 0 and b3 \u2192 0 correspond to the points A2 and A3 moving to lie on the line A1B1 respectively. Using this parametrization, we have for example that \u2329A2B2d2A2\u232a = db2da2\u2329A1B2Z\u2217B1\u232a etc. and the factor (64) produces db2db3/(b2 b3). Taking the residue then gives\nRes \u2329A1B1A2B2\u232a=0 \u2329A1B1A3B3\u232a=0\nF = da2da3\u2329A1B1d2A1\u232a \u220f3 i=1\u2329AiBid 2Bi\u232a \u2329A2B2A3B3\u232a . (66)\nWith the parametrisations (65), with b2 = b3 = 0 we see that the remaining singularity of F factorises into two terms \u2329A2B2A3B3\u232a = (a2\u2212a3)\u2329A1B1B2B3\u232a. This is another example of composite residues discussed in the introduction and section 2. The first factor a2\u2212a3 = 0 corresponds to the three loop lines intersecting in one point, while \u2329A1B1B2B3\u232a= 0 corresponds\nto the three lines lying in the same plane (and thus intersecting pairwise). We focus on the allin-one-point case (a2\u2212a3)\u2192 0 (intersecting A3B3 with A2B2 by sliding the intersection point A3 along the line A1B1 to meet the intersection point A2 see figure 2). We change variables from (a2, a3) to (a2,\u03be) where \u03be = (a2\u2212a3), so da2da3 = d\u03beda2 and the residue at \u03be \u2192 0 of (66) is\nRes \u03be=0 d\u03beda2 \u03be\n\u2329A1B1d2A1\u232a \u220f3 i=1\u2329AiBid 2Bi\u232a\n\u2329A1B1B2B3\u232a\n= \u2329Ad3A\u232a \u220f3 i=1\u2329ABid 2Bi\u232a\n\u2329AB1B2B3\u232a . (67)\nOn the right-hand side we have written the expression manifestly as a function of the common intersection point of all three lines A= A1 + a2B1, thus da2\u2329A1B1d2A1\u232a= \u2329Ad3A\u232a.\nSubstituting (67) into (63) gives the all-in-one-point cut of the three loop amplitude :\n\u2329Ad3A\u232a \u220f3 i=1\u2329ABid 2Bi\u232a\n\u2329AB1B2B3\u232a\n\u23291234\u232a3\u2329AB123\u232a \u2329AB114\u232a\u2329AB112\u232a\u2329AB134\u232a\u2329AB212\u232a\u2329AB223\u232a\u2329AB323\u232a\u2329AB334\u232a + symmetry ,\n(68)\nwhere the sum occurs by applying cyclic symmetry of the external momenta and permutation symmetry of the Bis. We see that after taking the three consecutive residues required to reach this final configuration, a new pole \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a appears explicitly in the denominator of the integrand. This is not the same as the result given for the all-in-one-point cut in [18] which is instead the canonical form of the intersection of the hyperplane \u2329AiBiA jB j\u232a = 0 with the amplituhedron.9 Taking further residues of this all-in-one-point cut, starting with the pole \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a one ends up with a maximal residue of 2 (see appendix C for this computation) which, as discussed in section 2 suggests the existence an internal boundary.\nIn the next subsection we therefore look at the geometrical region corresponding to taking the above all-in-one-point cut. We will find that the pole at \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a= 0 indeed corresponds geometrically to an internal boundary of the codimension 3 boundary of the four-point threeloop amplituhedron corresponding to the all-in-one-point cut."

Following precisely the residues taken in section 4.1, we first intersect line L1 with L2, then intersect L3 with L1, and finally intersect L2 and L3 by sliding A3 along L1.\nThe four-point loop level amplituhedron is defined as the set of loop lines Li = (AiBi) with i = 1, .., L satisfying\nA(L) = \u00a6 AiBi : \u2329AiBi k\u0304l\u0304\u232a> 0 , \u2329AiBiA jB j\u232a> 0 , 1\u2264 i, j \u2264 L, 1\u2264 k < l \u2264 4 \u00a9 .

We can not obtain this via an operation acting on the amplitude however but rather one would have to take a different operation on each contributing diagram.\nwhere j\u0304 \u2261 ( j\u22121 j j+1) and \u2329AiBi j\u0304 k\u0304\u232a \u2261 \u2329AiBi( j\u22121 j j+1)\u2229(k\u22121kk+1)\u232a. We then also have the loop-loop inequalities, \u2329AiBiA jB j\u232a> 0. The all-in-one point configuration occurs when all loop lines Li pass through a single point A, so we simply set Ai = A. Then the loop-loop inequalities trivialise and this all-in-one-point cut geometry is\nA(L)dc =A (L)|Ai=A = \u00a6 A, Bi : \u2329ABi k\u0304l\u0304\u232a> 0 , 1\u2264 k < l \u2264 4 \u00a9 . (72)\nThis is the codimension 3 configuration of the amplituhedron corresponding to all loop lines intersecting in one point.\nWe now however wish to examine in detail what happens when we take a sequence of codimension 1 boundaries in order to reach such a configuration. Using the same parametrisation as (65), A2 = A1+a2B1+b2Z\u2217, A3 = A1+a3B1+b3Z\u2217 the loop-loop inequalities become\n\u2329A1B1A2B2\u232a= \u2212b2\u2329A1B1B2Z\u2217\u232a> 0 , \u2329A1B1A3B3\u232a= b3\u2329A1B1Z\u2217B3\u232a> 0 , \u2329A2B2A3B3\u232a= (a2\u2212a3)\u2329A1B1B2B3\u232a+ (b2\u2212b3)\u2329A1Z\u2217B2B3\u232a> 0 .\n(73)\nWe then consider the boundary at a2 = a3 of the boundary at b3 = 0 of the boundary at b2 = 0, which corresponds precisely to taking the consecutive residues of (66) and below. Here Z\u2217 is chosen arbitrarily and we can arrange it so that \u2329A1B1B2Z\u2217\u232a< 0 and \u2329A1B1Z\u2217B3\u232a> 0 and thus b2, b3 > 0. Notice that the third inequality factorises when b2, b3 \u2192 0. This is the geometric version of the factorisation discussed below (66), related to composite residues and reducible varieties. Thus the boundary at b2, b3\u2192 0 is the union of two disconnected regions R1 \u222aR2\nR1 : a2 > a3 , \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a> 0 , R2 : a2 < a3 , \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a< 0 ,\n(74)\nwhere A = A1 + a2B1. The inequalities, (74), carve out a region consisting of two almost disconnected pieces of the same orientation. This geometry is illustrated in the picture (the same as for the two-loop internal boundary case (12))\nR1\nR2\n\u2022\n(75)\nwhere the x axis corresponds to the region a2 = a3 and the y axis corresponds to \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a= 0. The all-in-one-point cut corresponds to the boundary a2=a3 (so the x axis). We can then clearly see that the all-in-one-point cut consists of two regions, \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a \u2276 0, with opposite orientation separated by an (internal) boundary at \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a= 0:\n\u2022 \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a> 0\u2329AB1B2B3\u232a< 0 (76)\nGeometrically the two regions arise from the intersection point A3 approaching A2 from two different directions along the line A1B1 (see figure 2). Importantly, after approaching the all-in-one-point cut, the mutual positivity conditions between the loops of (73) do not trivialise, but instead new inequalities emerge dictated by the sign of \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a.\nSo altogether then, incorporating the inequalities resulting from (70) (rewritten as in (71)) we see that the the full geometry of the three-loop all-in-one-point cut is given by the two regions with opposite orientation\nRdc =Rdc1 \u222aR dc 2 , Rdc1 =A (3) dc \u2229 {\u2329AB1B2B3\u232a> 0} , positive orientation, Rdc2 =A (3) dc \u2229 \u00a6 \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a< 0 \u00a9 , negative orientation.\n(77)\nNote that the deepest cut geometry A(3)dc is the union of these two regions with the same orientation, but the actual result of taking boundaries of boundaries of boundaries requires the regions to have opposite orientation separated by an internal boundary. Also note that we made a choice of which loop lines to intersect first and which to slide etc. and one might expect different choices to give different results. This is indeed the case at higher loops. At three loops however the resulting geometry (77) is the unique geometry one obtains from approaching the all-in-one-point cut.\nSo to summarise we find that the all-in-one-point cut as computed as a residue corresponds to two regions of opposite orientation separated by an internal boundary. At higher loops it turns out that the all-in-one-point cut is no longer even unique but depends on the precise sequence of codimension 1 boundaries taken to reach it."

We show that while the final configuration is always the same \u2013 that is L lines intersecting in a point \u2013 distinct paths to reach this configuration can carve out different oriented regions.\nEnforcing that a line in 3d (which has four degrees of freedom) intersects a specified point kills two degrees of freedom. Thus making all L lines go through a specified point would reduce by 2L degrees of freedom. However the intersection point itself A is not fixed and has 3 degrees of freedom, thus only 2L \u2212 3 degrees of freedom are lost, corresponding to taking 2L \u2212 3 single residues. We distinguish between two types of residue, each of which has a different geometrical interpretation. The first is the intersection of two loop lines which are currently not connected by any set of intersecting lines (see figure 3 on the left). Taking the maximal possible number of such intersections results in a maximal tree configuration.10 These we will refer to simply as intersections. The second type occurs when we merge two separate intersection points along a line (see figure 3 on the right) which we shall call a sliding. An all-in-one-point cut then consists of (L\u22121) intersections and (L\u22122) slidings to make a total of 2L \u2212 3.\nTo perform an intersection, for example (AiBi) \u2229 (A jB j) depicted on the left in figure 3, we parameterise the point A j as A j = Ai + aBi + bZ\u2217 and take the residue b = 0. Similarly to the discussion at three loops leading to (66), any such intersection saturates one positivity condition, \u2329AiBiA jB j\u232a = 0, and does not generate any new inequalities. The order in which these are performed is also not important. The all-in-one-point cut consists of L \u2212 1 intersections, therefore (L\u22121) of the (2L\u22123) mutual positivity conditions are trivialised and no new inequalities arise.\n10More precisely the graph obtained by replacing each loop line with a vertex joined by edges if and only if the respective loop lines intersect should be a maximal tree on L vertices.\nThe remaining (L \u2212 2) mutual positivity conditions are handled by slidings. However, unlike the residues corresponding to the intersections, here new inequalities are generated. Let us begin by determining what happens when a residue is taken corresponding to a single sliding, for example the one depicted on the right in figure 3. We start off with two sets of lines intersecting at two different points, with one common loop that the two intersection points lie on.\nLet I and J be the sets of labels of the two groups of intersecting lines, k = I \u2229 J labels the line in common, and A, A \u2032 label the intersection points of the groups of lines I and J respectively, so\nA= \u22c2\ni\u2208I Li = Ak + c1Bk ,\nA \u2032 = \u22c2\nj\u2208J L j = Ak + c2Bk .\n(78)\nIn this parametrization the mutual positivity relation between loops in I and J reads\n\u2329AiBiA jB j\u232a= (c2\u2212c1)\u2329AkBiBkB j\u232a> 0 , for all i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J . (79)\nAs in the three loop case, the brackets factorize, giving rise to two almost disconnected regions (see (77). The geometric sliding residue is then calculated by taking the limits (c2\u2212 c1)\u2192 0\u00b1, leaving two regions with opposite orientation. A \u201cpositive\u201d region for which \u2329AkBiBkB j\u232a > 0 for all i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J and a \u201cnegative\u201d region for which \u2329AkBiBkB j\u232a< 0 for all i \u2208 I , j \u2208 J .\nTo compute an all-in-one-point cut we must take L\u22122 sliding residues, each of which splits the geometry of the boundary in two parts. If we label slidings by the index a = 1, ..., L\u22122 then we can identify a sub region with fixed orientation through the string s\u20d7 = {s1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , sL\u22122}, where sa = \u00b11 and keeps track of the signs of positively and negatively oriented regions. The resulting geometry is the union of these regions\nRdc = \u22c3\ns\u20d7\nRdcs\u20d7 ,\nRdcs\u20d7 =A (L) dc \u2229 A, Bi : sa\u2329ABiBka B j\u232a> 0, a = 1, .., L\u22122 , i \u2208 Ia , j \u2208 Ja , (80)\norientation of Rdcs\u20d7 = \u220f\na\nsa ,\nwhere we recall that A(L)dc is the deepest cut geometry, obtained by trivialising the loop-loop inequalities of the amplituhedron and sending Ai \u2192 A (72). In particular this region depends explicitly on the sequence of boundaries we took to approach the geometry through the sets Ia, Ja.\nNote that (80) generalises directly to describe the all-in-one-point cut geometry for amplituhedrons at any number of points. One just needs to add a Y \u2208 Gr(k, k+4) into each bracket and modify A(L)dc appropriately.\nExample: Four loop all-in-one-point cuts\nLet us illustrate (80) by giving an explicit example at four loops. Each 4 loop all-in-one-point cut is given by 3 intersections and 2 sidings. Denoting the intersection between lines Li and L j by (i, j) and a sliding between the sets of lines I and J as (I , J), we explore the cut\n{(1,2), (1,3), (1,4) ; (12, 13), (123,14)} , (81)\nrepresented in Figure 4a. From (80), the resulting geometry is given by a union of four regions:\nR1(D1) = A (L) dc \u2227 \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a> 0 \u2227 \u2329AB2B1B4\u232a> 0\u2227 \u2329AB3B1B4\u232a> 0 , + , R2(D1) = A (L) dc \u2227 \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a< 0 \u2227 \u2329AB2B1B4\u232a> 0\u2227 \u2329AB3B1B4\u232a> 0 , \u2212 , R3(D1) = A (L) dc \u2227 \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a> 0 \u2227 \u2329AB2B1B4\u232a< 0\u2227 \u2329AB3B1B4\u232a< 0 , \u2212 , R4(D1) = A (L) dc \u2227 \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a< 0 \u2227 \u2329AB2B1B4\u232a< 0\u2227 \u2329AB3B1B4\u232a< 0 , + ,\n(82)\nwhere A denotes the final point that all loops intersect, and the orientation of the regions is indicated on the right by a \u2018+\u2032 or \u2018\u2212\u2032. In particular, R1, R4 have the same orientation and R2, R3 have the same orientation but opposite to R1, R4.\nWe see that this four loop all-in-one-point cut geometry has an internal boundary at \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a= 0 and external boundaries at \u2329AB2B1B4\u232a= 0, \u2329AB3B1B4\u232a= 0. The corresponding multiple residue has poles in these positions.\nRecall that at 3 loops all possible ways of reaching the all-in-one-point cut configuration result in the same geometry (77). At 4 loops on the other hand there are twelve different possible geometries. They are all equivalent to each other up to permutations. That is they are all given by (82) after permuting the Bi (permuting B2, B3 in (82) gives back the same geometry up to swapping the overall orientation and so there are only 12 inequivalent permutations rather than 24).11 Thus the corresponding action of taking residues on a permutation invariant object such as the loop integrand yields the same result for all twelve four-loop all-in-one-point cuts. From 5 loops however there are genuinely different all-in-one-point cuts giving different results when the corresponding residues are taken on a permutation invariant object."

            "text": "One of the attractive features of the deepest cut defined in [18] was that its canonical form was defined by a simple formula at all loops. This was because the all-in-one-point configuration (72) consists of L independent one loop inequalities and no loop-loop inequalities and the resulting geometry thus factorises. We have seen however that any action of taking consecutive boundary components to reach the deepest cut configuration gives non-unique geometries which are more involved than (72) and in particular new loop-loop inequalities of the form \u2329ABiB jBk\u232a> 0 are generated, spoiling this factorisation. The presence of these brackets makes the computation of the canonical form much more challenging and also dependent on the particular sequence off boundaries taken to reach all-in-one-point configuration.\nIn this section we will show that despite this complication it can still be possible to find fairly simple all loop geometries by taking further residues after reaching the all-in-one-point cut configuration that trivialize all the new \u2329ABiB jBk\u232a inequalities. The further cuts constrain the loop lines to all lie in the same plane as well as going through the same point. They are thus simultaneously all-in-one-point and all-in-one-plane cut configurations. We will thus refer to them as all-in-one-point-and-plane cuts or point-and-plane cuts for short. They are defined in terms of the point A which all loop lines go through together with the plane (AP1P2) which all loop lines lie on. It is useful also to project through the point A and thus reduce the geometry to 2d, in which case we refer to the plane P instead as a line.\nIf we project through the common intersection point A, the geometry of the cut correspond to L points Bi on an oriented line P in P2. Starting at 4 loops, the \u2329ABiB jBk\u232a inequalities force some ordering between the points on P. As a practical consequence, this implies that an allin-one-point-and-plane cut can itself also have further loop-loop type boundaries at Bi = B j . Thus taking the residues / boundaries on these effectively reduces the number of free loop variables further. We call a cut for which we have exhausted all loop-loop type residues a maximal loop-loop cut. All the maximal loop-loop cuts that we have considered correspond \u2013 up to a permutation of the Bs and an integer factor arising from the number of internal boundaries taken in reaching there \u2013 to the three loop maximal loop-loop cut (which is also the unique all-in-one-point-and-plane cut)\nAL=3mll = A, P, Bi = P1 + bi P2 : \u2329ABi j\u0304 k\u0304\u232a> 0 : i = 1,2, 3 , 1\u2264 j < k \u2264 4 . (83)\nWe conjecture this to hold in general, that is the maximal loop loop cut always reduces to the three loop one, ALmll =A L=3 mll .\nIn this section we will show how to compute the geometry and the canonical form of the all-in-one-point-and-plane cut from the amplituhedron. We will start with the 2 and 3 loop cases, which contain all the main features of the problem. Then we will look at the geometry\n11The choice of all-in-one-point cut D2 = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,4) ; (12, 13), (123, 24)} illustrated in figure 4b looks like a different case at first sight but in fact results in the same geometry as (82) after permuting B1 and B2.\nof the only 2 independent (up to permutations of the loop lines) all-in-one-point-and-plane cuts at 4 loops, and finally we will define a particular cut at arbitrary loops and compute its canonical form."

            "text": "At higher loops one can take further boundaries of the all-in-one-point configuration so that the lines all lie in a single plane. But at two loops we only have two lines intersecting in a point so they automatically lie in the same plane. Thus the all-in-one-point and the all-in-one-pointand-plane cases are identical. Nevertheless it is useful to rewrite the two loop all-in-one-point case in the same variables we will use at higher loops, namely in terms of a single line P in P2 (after projection through A) on which the Bis lie (each now with 1 degree of freedom). At two loops the all-in-one-point cut is obtained simply by taking the residue in \u2329A1B1A2B2\u232a of (91) and is thus given by\nA(2)dc = \u2329AB1d2B1\u232a\u2329AB2d2B2\u232a\u23291234\u232a3\u2329Ad3A\u232a \u2329AB114\u232a\u2329AB112\u232a\u2329AB223\u232a\u2329AB234\u232a 1 \u2329AB134\u232a\u2329AB212\u232a + 1 \u2329AB123\u232a\u2329AB214\u232a + B1 \u2194 B2 .\n(84) The deepest cut formula of [18] is however a completely different-looking yet identical formula for A(2)dc obtained by computing the canonical form of its corresponding geometry (72) (we recall that at two loops this correctly reproduces the corresponding residue but not beyond).\nFollowing [18], the first step in computing the canonical form is to triangulate the A geometry into regions where the brackets \u2329Ai jk\u232a have a well defined sign. Let\u2019s derive such a tiling for the intersection point A = A1B1 \u2229 A2B2. Since the intersection point A can occur at any point along a loop line, the allowed space for A can be computed as the linear combination A= c1A1 + c2B1, where A1B1 lives in the amplituhedron. Notice, that the intersection point A is defined up to a sign, so we can fix for example c1 > 0. Solving the inequalities one finds that the allowed regions for A correspond to 4 twisted cyclic permutations12 of the solution\n\u2329A123\u232a> 0 , \u2329A124\u232a> 0 , \u2329A134\u232a< 0 , \u2329A234\u232a> 0 . (85)\nAll these cyclically related A regions are tetrahedra, and their canonical forms \u03c9i(A) (where we assign the label i = 1 to region (85) and the other values to its cyclic twisted permutations) can be written as \u03c9i(A) = (\u22121)i\u03c9(A), with\n\u03c9(A) = \u2329Ad3A\u232a\u23291234\u232a3\n\u2329A123\u232a\u2329A234\u232a\u2329A134\u232a\u2329A124\u232a . (86)\nWe can now project through A onto a plane not containing A and the remaining geometry is two dimensional. The configuration of Zi arising from (85) is such that 1,2, 3 form an anti-clockwise oriented triangle containing 4:\n1\n3 23\u2229 14\n4\n2\n(87)\nNow we can analyze the B inequalities\n\u2329AB14\u232a> 0 , \u2329AB23\u232a> 0 , \u2329AB34\u232a> 0 , \u2329AB12\u232a> 0 , (88)\n12Zi \u2192 Zi+1 for i = 1,2, 3 and Z4\u2192\u2212Z1.\nwhich one can see puts B inside the shaded triangle in (87), with vertices {4, 3, (23)\u2229 (14)}. For general i after cycling we have that the Bi are in the triangle with edges (i+2 i+3), (i i+4), (i+1 i+2) and vertices\nWi1 = i+2 ,Wi2 = i+3 , Wi3 = (i+1 i+2)\u2229 (i i+3) . (89)\nFor fixed i, our problem now simply reduces to computing the canonical form of two points B1 and B2 living independently inside the triangle (Wi1Wi2Wi3). Each point Bi thus has the canonical form of a triangle and we obtain the two loop deepest cut form as\nA(2)dc = 4 \u2211\ni=1\n(\u22121)i\u2329Ad3A\u232a\u23291234\u232a3\n\u2329A123\u232a\u2329A234\u232a\u2329A134\u232a\u2329A124\u232a\n2 \u220f\nL=1\n\u2329ABLd2BL\u232a\u2329AWi1Wi2Wi3\u232a2\n\u2329ABLWi1Wi2\u232a\u2329ABLWi2Wi3\u232a\u2329ABLWi3Wi1\u232a . (90)\nRemarkably, this is indeed equal to (84). But we now wish to rewrite this further in a way appropriate for the higher loop all-inone-point-and-plane cut. So instead of considering the Bi living in 2d, we consider first fixing a line P and then two points B\u20321, B \u2032 2 living on the 1d line P.\nThe Jacobian of the transformation from B1, B2 to P, B \u2032 1, B \u2032 2 is given by\n\u2329AB1d2B1\u232a\u2329AB2d2B2\u232a= \u2329AZ\u2217B\u20321B \u2032 2\u232a\u2329AZ\u2217B \u2032 1dB \u2032 1\u232a\u2329AZ\u2217B \u2032 2dB \u2032 2\u232a\u2329APdP1\u232a\u2329APdP2\u232a\n\u2329AZ\u2217P\u232a3 , (91)\nwhere Z\u2217 is a fixed element of P3 such that \u2329AB1B2Z\u2217\u232a \u0338= 0. Notice that the 2-loop deepest cut is symmetric in B1 and B2, but becomes anti-symmetric in B \u2032 1, B \u2032 2. This corresponds geometrically to the fact that switching B1, B2 flips the orientation of the configuration on the right. We will shortly see how this symmetry is reflected in the amplituhedron geometry in the new variables. From now on we will drop the primes on the Bis.\nThe task is now to translate the geometry of two points in a triangle to that of a line through a triangle and two points on that line. We start by observing that the geometry of a line through a triangle can be triangulated into 3 regions. These correspond to the combination of the 3 ways in which the line P can intersect the edges of the triangle. However it will turn out that we also need to consider which side B1 is of B2 (due to the orientation switch mentioned above) and so we in fact need to split into 6 regions.\nWi,3\nWi,2\nWi,1\nB1 B2 P\nWi,3\nWi,2\nWi,1\nB2 B1 P\n(92)\nLet\u2019s consider one of these 6 regions, the one on the left in (92). It is described by the inequalities\n\u2329PWi,1\u232a> 0 , \u2329PWi,2\u232a< 0 , \u2329PWi,3\u232a> 0 , \u2329BlWi, jWi, j+1\u232a> 0 , with j = 1, 2,3 , and l = 1, 2 , \u2329Wi,2B1B2\u232a< 0 ,\n(93)\nwith the last inequality ensuring that B1 and B2 are ordered. Then all 6 configurations can be generated by cyclic permutations of (93) together with B1\u2194 B2. We will use p = 1, 2,3 to label the cyclic permutations of (93), with p = 2 corresponding to the case (93).\nThe canonical form \u03bbi,p(P) corresponding to a line through the triangle is the same for all p = 1,2, 3 and equal to\n\u03bbi,p(P) = \u03bbi(P) = \u2212 \u2329PdP1\u232a\u2329PdP2\u232a\u2329Wi,1Wi,2Wi,3\u232a \u2329PWi,1\u232a\u2329PWi,2\u232a\u2329PWi,3\u232a , with p = 1, 2,3 . (94)\nFor fixed i and p, the geometry of B1 and B2 corresponds to two points living on the segment with vertices Ii,p = (Wi,p\u22121Wi,p)\u2229 P and Ji,p = (Wi,pWi,p+1)\u2229 P.\nThe canonical form of a point B on a segment (I J) in P1 can be written in general as\n[I ; B; J] := \u2329JdB\u232a \u2329JB\u232a \u2212 \u2329IdB\u232a \u2329IB\u232a = \u2329BdB\u232a\u2329I J\u232a \u2329BI\u232a\u2329JB\u232a . (95)\nFor our application the 1d segment lives in P2 (well really in P3 but we already projected through A onto P2). We can choose any point to project onto the segment, call this Z\u2217,\n13 then all the two brackets in the above formula can be viewed as 3-brackets with an additional Z\u2217 and in turn eventually as 4-brackets with an additional A (so eg \u2329BdB\u232a= \u2329Z\u2217BdB\u232a= \u2329AZ\u2217BdB\u232a etc.)\nThen, the canonical form for B1, B2 ordered on the segment (I J), with I < B1 < B2 < J can be written as\n[I ; B1, B2; J] := [I ; B1; J][B1; B2; J] = [I ; B1; B2][I ; B2; J] , (96)\nand similarly for arbitrary numbers of ordered Bi on (I J) we define inductively\n[I ; B1, .., BL; J] := [I ; B1, .., BL\u22121; J][BL\u22121; BL; J] . (97)\nNow we claim that the canonical form for two free points B1, B2 in a triangle translates as follows\n2 \u220f\nl=1\n\u2329ABl d2Bl\u232a\u2329AWi1Wi2Wi3\u232a2\n\u2329ABlWi1Wi2\u232a\u2329ABlWi2Wi3\u232a\u2329ABlWi3Wi1\u232a = \u03bbi(P)\n3 \u2211\np=1\n[Iip; B1, B2; Jip]\u2212 [Iip; B2, B1; Jip] .\n(98) Note in particular the minus sign between the canonical forms for the two orderings of B1, B2. This is because the orientation flips when B1 passes through B2 as discussed below (91).\nWe can finally put all the pieces together and write the canonical form A(L)dc in terms of these variables as\nA(2)dc =\u03c9(A) 4 \u2211\ni=1\n(\u22121)i\u03bbi(P) 3 \u2211\np=1\n[Iip; B1, B2; Jip]\u2212 [Iip; B2, B1; Jip] . (99)\nAn interesting aspect of this formula is that each term in the sum has a pole at B1 = B2. For i, p fixed this represent an internal boundary of the geometry. The sum of the residues over p though, as expected from (84), is equal to zero, which means that this pole is actually a spurious one. Geometrically, we have that when the only two points on P coincide the latter can rotate unconstrained on the pivotal point B1 = B2 and therefore its canonical form will be zero.\n13Note that a natural point to choose for Z\u2217 is the intersection point of the two edges that P is passing through, Wi,p. Then the intersection points Iip \u223cWi,p\u22121 and Jip \u223cWi,p+1 and thus the formulae dramatically simplify."

The result is no orientation change at all. We are now interested in the geometry of the internal boundary \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a = 0 so moving B3 also onto the line P. The point B3 is free to go anywhere on the line P (inside the triangle). The resulting geometry is indeed just that of three free points on the line P with the canonical form (101), including the factor of 2 from taking an internal boundary.\nNotice that in this case there are no remaining singularities of the form Bi \u2192 B j so A (3) point-plane\nalso represents what we call a maximal loop-loop cut and 2AL=3mll :=A (3) point-plane."

            "text": "We have seen that at 3-loops the all-in-one-point-and-plane cut is unique (101). At 4-loops this is not true anymore and we can have two types of geometry (modulo permutations) resulting from approaching the point-plane configuration in different ways. Each will be characterized algebraically by different coefficients c\u03c3 in (100) and geometrically by different ordering constraints of the Bs on the line P.\nWe start with the all-in-one-point cut which is unique up to permutations of the loop lines and the resulting geometry given by (82). We now consider taking further boundaries of this geometry so the loops also lie in a plane. There are 3 possible loop-loop boundaries, \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a= 0, \u2329AB2B1B4\u232a= 0 and \u2329AB3B1B4\u232a= 0. We start by looking at the geometry of the boundary when B3 lies on the line P (on which B1, B2 lie) followed by the boundary of that geometry found when B4 also approaches P (shortly we will switch the order of in which we take these boundaries).\nThe resulting geometry is of the four points Bi on the line P inside the triangle, with the following restrictions: B1 is not allowed to be between B2 and B3 and the orientation depends on the relative position of B1 and the pair B2, B3 (with the position of B4 unconstrained). This geometry is derived in appendix D.\nThe cut resulting from this geometry is then given by the general form (100) with\nnI = 2 , c\u03c3 =\n\n \n  1 , \u03c3 = (2,3, 1) (4) or (3,2, 1) (4) , \u22121 , \u03c3 = (1,2, 3) (4) or (1,3, 2) (4) , 0 , \u03c3 = (2,1, 3) (4) or (3, 1,2) (4) ,\n(102)\nwhere is the shuffle operation (thus 4 can appear in any position). We have checked this is indeed correct by explicitly taking the corresponding residues of the 4 loop amplitude and finding perfect agreement.\nNow note that even after taking the all-in-one-point and the all-in-one-plane configuration there are still uncancelled loop-loop poles at B1 = B2 and B1 = B3, corresponding geometrically to external boundaries.\nUsing the very simple residue structure of the ordered points on an interval canonical form, namely\nResBk\u2192B j [I ; .., Bi , B j , Bk, Bl ..; J] = \u2212ResBk\u2192B j [I ; .., Bi , Bk, B j , Bl ..; J] = [I ; .., Bi , B j , Bl ..; J] , (103)\none can quickly check that the residue of the four-loop point-plane cut (102) when B1 = B2 or B1 = B3 precisely reproduces the three-loop point-plane cut (101) with appropriate variables and with weight 4 instead of 2 (since this time we approached two internal boundaries, \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a = 0 and \u2329AB2B3B4\u232a = 0). This implies that the residue corresponding to this 4- loop maximal loop-loop boundary is equal to 2 times the all-in-one-point-and-plane 3-loop residue (C.12).\nReturning to the all-in-one-point cut, we now consider the only other independent way of reaching the point-plane geometry (modulo permutation of the loop variables) by taking \u2329AB2B1B4\u232a= 0 by sending B4 to the line P followed by sending B3 to the line P (the other way around to what we did above). In appendix D we again examine this carefully geometrically. The end result this time is the geometry of four points Bi unconstrained on the line P but with the overall orientation dependent on the ordering of B1, B2. The resulting canonical form is thus given by (100) with\nnI = 1 , c\u03c3 =\n\u00a8\n1 , \u03c3 = (2,1) (3, 4) , \u22121 , \u03c3 = (1,2) (3, 4) ,\n(104)\nas we have confirmed by taking the residues explicitly and comparing. Note that this time there is a remaining loop-loop residue apparent at B1 \u2192 B2 (corresponding to an internal boundary). Taking the residue as above this again leads to the three loop point-plane result (101) after which no more loop loop residues are present. This final configuration corresponds to the 3-loop maximal cut Amll with weight 2."

            "text": "We have already seen from the four loop examples of the previous section that the point-plane cut depends on how you approach the configuration. However one can give specific ways of approaching the point-plane geometry at any loop order and find the resulting cut. So we conclude this section by giving precisely such an example of a cut that can be computed at\narbitrary loop order. This means that we are now specifying an ordered set of residues and giving a closed formula for the result. The particular case is a generalisation of the second 4-loop case considered in the previous subsection.\nWe start defining what we call the simplest all-in-one-point cut. In this all loop lines first intersect the line A1B1 and then they all slide to the same intersection point in the same order as their labeling. The geometry of this boundary at L loops can be obtained from (E.4) and is given explicitly in appendix E.\nAfter taking the above all-in-one-point cut we then constrain all loops to lie on the same line P, first B1, B2 then BL , BL\u22121, .., B3 thus taking the ordered series of boundaries {\u2329AB2B1BL\u232a= 0, \u2329AB2B1BL\u22121\u232a= 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a= 0}.\nCarefully examining the resulting geometry as is done explicitly in appendix E, we arrive at the final geometry corresponding to this point-plane cut. It is given by L points Bi lying on the line P, with B3, BL unconstrained and with B1 always lying between B2 and all of the points B4, .., BL\u22121. The orientation of the geometry depends on the relative order of B1, B2. The resulting canonical form at arbitrary loop order is thus\nA(L)point-plane = 2 4 \u2211\ni=1\n\u03c9(A) 3 \u2211\np=1\n\u03bbi,p(P)[Ii,p; B3; Ji,p][Ii,p; BL; Ji,p]\n\u00d7 [Ii,p; B2, B1; Ji,p] L\u22121 \u220f\nl=4\n[B1; Bl ; Ji,p] + (\u22121)L\u22121[Ii,p; B1, B2; Ji,p] L\u22121 \u220f\nl=4\n[Ii,p; Bl ; B1] .\n(105)\nWe tested (105) by computing this simplest maximal loop-loop residue up to 7 loops from the explicit from of the amplitude obtained in [22] and found complete agreement. We see that this point-plane cut has further poles when Bl \u2192 B1. We have checked up to 5 loops that taking further residues in these poles eventually leads to the 3 loop point-plane cut (101). Indeed our investigations so far indicate that after taking any all-in-one-point-and-plane geometry at any loop order, there are always L\u22123 boundaries of the form Bi \u2192 B j remaining. After further taking these boundaries we are then always lead to the three loop point-plane geometry (101). It might be possible to prove this starting from the explicit all-in-one-point geometry (80)."

            "heading": "6 Conclusions",
            "text": "We summarise the main points of the paper and point out topics for further work. We began by observing that non-vanishing maximal residues of loop amplitudes are not always \u00b11 as has generally been assumed, but can take arbitrary values in Z, apparently contradicting the fact that the loop amplituhedron is a positive geometry. We found the source of this apparent contradiction geometrically to be the existence of internal boundaries in the geometry where two regions of opposite orientation touch. This minimally requires including an extra term in the recursive definition of the canonical form to take into account these internal boundaries (22). In all the examples we have found, the internal boundaries arise from loop-loop propagators factorizing into the product of two factors. Algebraically these are examples of composite residues discussed in this context in [9] and it would be interesting to explore the relation between composite residues and internal boundaries in more detail.\nAs well as internal boundaries we have also stressed another under emphasised feature of the boundary structure of the amplituhedron and multiple residues, namely the simple fact that multiple-residues and corresponding multiple boundaries are non-unique. On the algebraic side a multiple residue is defined as an (ordered) sequence of simple residues. In the same way, on the geometrical side the relevant quantity one must use is \u2018boundaries of\nboundaries of...\u2019 rather than \u2018codimension k boundaries\u2019. It would be interesting to revisit previous computations of the boundary structure of the loop amplituhedron, and in particular its genus, for example [16], taking into account both internal boundaries and the above non uniqueness of codimension k boundaries.\nThese two features of the amplituhedron, internal boundaries and ambiguity of multiple boundaries, come into sharp focus when investigating the deepest cuts of [18]. The all loop formulae for these cuts described there is not obtainable directly by taking multiple single residues of the amplituhedron due to the presence of internal boundaries. We have shown that nevertheless all-loop formulae can be obtained. They will inevitably depend though on the details of the cut taken (that is the precise sequence of simple residues taken) and they will in general contain further loop-loop poles after reaching the all-in-one-point cut configuration. We give an example of an all loop formula for a particular all in plane and point cut. It would be fascinating to obtain a general formula taking as input the details of the cut taken and as output the corresponding canonical form. In general it seems that, taking loop-loop type residues there are always available more loop-loop type poles (or boundaries) until one eventually reaches a configuration with just three loop lines (so all other loop lines coincide with one of these three) intersecting in a point and lying in a plane. This is arguably then the true \u2018deepest cut\u2019 or \u2018maximal loop-loop cut\u2019 one can take. That is to say it is the maximal cut involving only loop-loop type poles. It has a universal form given by the three loop all in plane and point cut, but with an integer valued coefficient related to the number of internal boundaries one takes in arriving there.\nThe four-point planar amplitude integrand in N = 4 SYM (and its closely related half BPS correlator) is known to ten loops using various graphical rules together with correlator insights [22]. There have also been investigations o it directly using amplituhedron insights [23\u201325]. A key question in this context then is whether the above all-loop cuts can be used practically to actually compute the 4-point amplitude/correlator at higher loops. Taking maximal residues (eg first the all-in-one-point cut, then further external cuts) yields a vast amount of information about the amplitude. It also has the tantalising chance of being a constructive approach: rather than using a huge basis of graphs and determining their coefficients, most of which are zero, it might be possible to use the cuts to construct only the relevant graphs and non-zero coefficients with which they appear.\nAlthough we have focused on 4 points, the all-in-one-point cut and more general loop-loop cuts are largely independent of the number of points, and also the MHV degree, since they involve only the mutual geometry between loop lines rather than the details of the external geometry. There has been some nice recent progress in computing the amplitude for arbitrary multiplicity directly from the loop amplituhedron [14, 26\u201328]. Points worthy of note in the current context are that taking the maximal multiple residues involving loops at higher points yields leading singularities of amplitudes \u2013 rational coefficients \u2013 which have been extensively analysed and are given by Yangian invariant Grassmann integrals [9,29]. Furthermore in the works [4, 5] a method for extracting a list of the physical amplitude\u2019s branch points from the amplituhedron is suggested. Here the boundaries are derived by intersecting the closure of the amplituhedron with the boundary components corresponding to vanishing brackets of the form \u2329ABi j\u232a, \u2329AiBiA jB j\u232a. It would be extremely interesting to revisit both the above points using the insights and technology developed here.\nUnlike positive geometries, the space of generalised positive geometries is closed under union: regions that are triangulated by GPGs will be GPGs. This then suggests they might be a better arena to seek a direct characterisation \u2013 that is a simple straightforward answer to the question \u2018is the following region a GPG or not\u2019 \u2013 than PGs. In particular it seems clear that all multi-linear geometries are GPGs, and their canonical form can be computed algorithmically via cylindrical decomposition. Nicely all Grassmannian-type geometries, the type seen in\nphysics, are multi-linear geometries and thus GPGs. But this is not the most general class and the most general classification needs more investigation.\nThe generalisation of positive geometry to include internal boundaries also suggests the utility of a further generalisation to weighted positive geometries where instead the weights contain the information about internal boundaries, and the canonical form has a much more natural definition (36). This concept also makes certain proofs very direct since one can add two WPGs together without first making sure they are disjoint (see eg the proof of triangulations of positive geometries in section 3.5).\nIn [2, 30] the geometry of the log of the MHV amplitude is considered and defined as a union of geometries with negative mutual positivity condition \u2329AiBiA jB j\u232a < 0. One of these has negative mutual positivity condition for all i, j and its canonical form is equal to the amplituhedron canonical form. The latter is the only term in the log of the amplitude surviving the all-in-one-point cut and therefore the all-in-one-point cut of the amplitude and the log of the amplitude are the same. The log of amplitude should most naturally be described by a WPG.\nWe believe that the above insights will also have utility in the increasing number of wider applications of positive geometry concepts in physics beyond the amplituhedron. One closely related case is the momentum amplituhedron. For the tree-level momentum amplituhedron [31] a lot is known about its boundary stratification [32,33] and its Euler characteristic has been proven to be equal to one [34], a strong indication that the geometry is free from internal boundaries. However, despite the very solid understanding achieved at tree level, finding the geometry of the loop momentum amplituhedron remains an open problem. In this case we expect internal boundaries to appear and the language of WPGs could give the right framework to define a loop momentum amplituhedron. Also in the search for a non-planar amplituhedron interesting ideas involving the sum of geometries over different orderings have been explored in [35, 36] and might benefit from being viewed as weighted positive geometries. Other wider applications of positive geometry which one could revisit include [37\u201344]. Similarly weighted positive geometry may provide the right mathematical framework to deal with cosmological correlators, which contrarily to the wavefunction of the universe described by the cosmological polytopes [45,46]s, do not currently have a geometrical description. Their maximal residues are not+/- 1 and they naively appears as a weigheted sum of canonical forms of cosmological polytopes (P. Benincasa, private communication)."

An oriented manifold M is oriented if it posses a continuous top differential form O that is always non-vanishing in M. The orientation is then equivalently defined by this volume form modulo positive scaling. Suppose then M has a boundary \u2202M of codimension one. The orientation \u03c9\u2202 induced by O on \u2202M will be the projection of O on \u2202M. We will now define what we mean by projection. Let the boundary be defined by f = 0 with f > 0 inside and f < 0 outside the region (at least near by). Then O\u2202 is defined simply as\nd f \u2227O\u2202 =O|\u2202M . (A.1)\nNote that the standard convention in math literature differ by a sign, that is d f represents an outward pointing differential. We make this choice so that the segment x > 0 with positive orientation form O(x) = dx has orientation O|x=0 = 1. In this way the canonical form of the positively oriented segment is \u2126(x > 0, dx) = dxx , in fact this form satisfies\nResx=0 dx x = O|x=0 = 1 . (A.2)"

The interior of the squared amplituhedron consists of several disconnected components so the first problem is to define the relative orientation of these components. The second problem is that the square of the super-amplitude has non-normalizable maximal residues and therefore can not be possibly interpreted as a canonical form of a positive geometry. We solved both problems by noticing that the GCD algorithm (see [11,20]) correctly reproduces the canonical form of the squared amplituhedron. The GCD algorithm works in coordinates, that is on a Rkm patch of the oriented Grassmannian using the tiling property of canonical forms. The orientation of the subregions given by the GCD are fixed by the algorithm as the global orientation of the coordinate patch. Then it gives the result as the sum of the canonical forms of the positive geometries triangulating the region. We then defined the oriented canonical form as the sum of the canonical form of the regions triangulating the squared amplituhedron.\nWith the new concept we introduced in this paper, we can simply say then that the squared amplituhedron is a GPG with the orientation fixed by the global orientation of the oriented Grassmannian.

            "text": "Here we consider taking further residues of the all-in-one-point cut (68) to eventually arrive at the leading singularities. Then we will consider the same sequence geometrically. Indeed in [21] such maximal residues were considered leading to a final configuration in which all loop lines intersect external twistors as well as intersecting each other at a single point A.\nSpecifically we consider the case where loop line L1 intersects Z1 and L2, L3 intersect Z2. We here show that the resulting residue depends on the path taken. Furthermore if the path taken involves taking a residue in \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a= 0 first, then the resulting maximal residue has magnitude 2 suggesting that \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a= 0 corresponds to an internal boundary.\nThe two routes we consider to reach the above configuration are as follows. For route 2 we first take further residues of the all-in-one-point cut (68) in the following order\n\u2329AB112\u232a= 0 , \u2329AB114\u232a= 0 , \u2329AB212\u232a= 0 , \u2329AB223\u232a= 0 . (C.1)\nThis corresponds to intersecting line L1 with the edge Z1Z4 and then with Z1 followed by intersecting L2 with the edge Z1Z2 and then to Z2. In the process the pole \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a \u2192 \u2329A12B3\u232a and so the final step is to take residues in this pole \u2329A12B3\u232a = 0 followed by \u2329A23B3\u232a = 0 corresponding to L3 intersecting Z1Z2 and then sliding to Z2. We take the residues explicitly by parametrizing the Bi as follows (with Z\u2217 an arbitrary twistor)\nB1 = c1Z4 + Z1 + d1Z\u2217 , B2 = c2Z1 + Z2 + d2Z\u2217 ,\nB3 = c3Z1 + Z2 + d3Z\u2217 , (C.2)\nand considering the residues at zero in d1, c1, d2, c2, d3, c3 in that order. The residues are straightforward to compute and can be done covariantly, for example:\nRes d1=0, c1=0 \u2329AB1d2B1\u232a \u2329AB114\u232a\u2329AB112\u232a = \u22121 \u2329A214\u232a . (C.3)\nOnly the displayed term in (67) out of the 24 total terms survives this sequence of residues and it produces the final result\n\u2212 \u23291234\u232a3\u2329Ad3A\u232a\n\u2329A123\u232a\u2329A124\u232a\u2329A134\u232a\u2329A234\u232a = \u2212 dadbdc abc , (C.4)\nwhere on the right hand side we parametrise the point A as\nA= Z1 + aZ2 + bZ3 + cZ4 . (C.5)\nThis is the canonical form of a tetrahedron with vertices Zi and is inline with the prediction of [21]. Indeed the mutual intersection point A is now the only remaining freedom and restricting the amplituhedron geometry to this configuration results in the tetrahedron. However as we saw in the simple example in the introduction, simply restricting the geometry to a high codimension boundary will not always give the right answer and the precise order in which one takes the residues can be important.\nFor route 2 therefore we change the order in which we take the residues on the all-in-onepoint cut (68). We first take a residue in the pole \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a making L3 coplanar with L1 and L2. Then proceed taking residues as previously in (C.1) moving B1\u2192 Z1 and B2\u2192 Z2. Then finally we take a residue as B3\u2192 Z2. Explicitly then, this time we parametrize the Bi as follows\nB3 = c3B1 + B2 + d3Z\u2217 , B1 = c1Z4 + Z1 + d1Z\u2217 ,\nB2 = c2Z1 + Z2 + d2Z\u2217 , (C.6)\nand take the residues at zero in the order d3, d1, c1, d2, c2, c3. The first residue is\nRes \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a=0 \u2329AB3d2B3\u232a \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a = \u2212dc3 , (C.7)\nand then use similar results to (C.3) before finally taking the residue in the parameter c3. This time two terms in (67) survive, the displayed term together with the term\n\u2329Ad3A\u232a \u220f3 i=1\u2329ABid 2Bi\u232a\u23291234\u232a3 \u232923AB1\u232a\n\u232912AB1\u232a \u232912AB3\u232a \u232914AB1\u232a \u232923AB2\u232a \u232923AB3\u232a \u232934AB1\u232a \u232934AB2\u232a \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a . (C.8)\nNote that this term only survives because a required pole \u232912AB2\u232a appears from the pole in \u232912AB3\u232a after the residues in d3 = 0, d1 = 0, c1 = 0 have been taken. Since there are two terms now surviving, the final result turns out to be twice (C.4)\n\u2212 2\u23291234\u232a3\u2329Ad3A\u232a\n\u2329A123\u232a\u2329A124\u232a\u2329A134\u232a\u2329A234\u232a = \u22122 dadbdc abc . (C.9)\nNow the final configuration of these two routes is exactly the same in both cases: B1 \u2192 Z1, B2, B3 \u2192 Z2 and yet the results differ by a factor of 2. We thus clearly see the importance of path dependence when taking residues. We will shortly see that path dependence can give different results for the all-in-one-point cut itself (rather than just when taking further residues). Furthermore, taking three further residues as a, b, c \u2192 0 clearly gives us a maximal residue of magnitude 2 indicating that there is an internal boundary present. Let us then consider this geometrically.\nWe can now redo the above computation geometrically by taking boundaries of the all-inone-point cut geometry (77) and using our formula of the canonical form of a GPG (22). To do this, we parametrise A and Bi just as in (C.5) and (C.6)\nB3 = c3B1 + B2 + d3Z\u2217 , B1 = c1Z4 + Z1 + d1Z\u2217 , B2 = c2Z1 + Z2 + d2Z\u2217 ,\nA = Z1 + aZ2 + bZ3 + cZ4 .\n(C.10)\nThen take boundaries in the same order with which we took residues following (C.9)\nd3 = 0 , d1 = 0 , c1 = 0 , d2 = 0 , c2 = 0 , c3 = 0 . (C.11)\nThe first boundary corresponds to the above internal boundary \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a = 0. Therefore, from the recursive definition of the canonical form in the presence of internal boundaries (22), the canonical form of the all-in-one-point cut geometry satisfies\nlim d3\u21920 d3\n\u2126(Rdc1 ) +\u2126(R dc 2 ) = 2dd3 \u2227\u2126 Rdc|\u2329AB1B2B3\u232a=0 . (C.12)\nThis simply means that the residue, d3 = 0, on the canonical form determined by the inequalities describing the geometry of the all-in-one-point cut (74), is equal to twice the canonical form of the interior boundary, i.e. the canonical form determined by the inequalities (70) with B3 = B1 + a3B2.\nContinuing with the remaining boundaries, the final geometry is described by the following set of inequalities,\nRfinal : a < 0 , b > 0 , c > 0 . (C.13)\nThe remaining residues were all on external boundaries, therefore the canonical form of the final region is 2\u2126(Rfinal), where the factor of two comes from the internal boundary residue (C.12). The final inequalities describe a tetrahedron with vertices {Z1,\u2212Z2, Z3, Z4} and therefore the final canonical form is in precise agreement with (C.4).\nWe see that the internal boundary at \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a = 0 is key to obtaining the correct leading singularity from the geometry. Just as we saw algebraically above, it is also possible to\nreach the same final loop configuration by only going to consecutive external boundaries. An example of this would be to follow the residues described in (C.2) geometrically. Then the final canonical form would be, up to an overall sign, the canonical form of the tetrahedron without the factor of two, as predicted in [21]. We see that the precise sequence of codimension 1 boundaries taken to approach higher codimension boundaries starting from the all-in-one-point cut configuration can give different results. At higher loops this is also true for the all-in-one-point cut itself (rather than just its maximal residues as here)."

            "text": "We here examine the geometry of the loop-loop boundaries of the four loop all-in-one-point cut (82). We start by the boundary when B3 lies on the line P = B1B2 followed by the boundary of that geometry when B4 also approaches P. We observe that the regions R1 and R2 of (82) touch on \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a= 0 as do R3 and R4. Since the orientations of R1 and R2 are opposite as areR3 andR4, this is an internal boundary. Thus the geometry of the (internal) amplituhedron boundary \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a= 0, with B3 living on B2B1, is given by R12 \u222aR34 where\nR12 = A (4) dc \u2227 \u2329AB2B1B4\u232a> 0\u2227 \u2329AB3B1B4\u232a> 0|B3\u2208B2B1 , + , R34 = A (4) dc \u2227 \u2329AB2B1B4\u232a< 0\u2227 \u2329AB3B1B4\u232a< 0|B3\u2208B2B1 , \u2212 .\n(D.1)\nHere R12 is positively oriented (indicated by the +), while R34 is negatively oriented. Notice that both of these regions require B1 to be on the same side of B2 and B3. In other words B1 can not lie between B2 and B3. Further the orientation depends which side of B2, B3, B1 is on. Then after we send B4 to the line P, we approach another internal boundary, with no further constraints on where B4 can lie. We thus conclude that the geometry is of the four points Bi on the line P inside the triangle, with B1 not allowed between B2 and B3 and the orientation depending on the relative position of B1 and B2, B3.\nWe can check the geometry more carefully by exploring the boundaries of (D.1) explicitly. To do this we make the constraint \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a = 0 explicit by expanding B1 as c1B2 + c2B3. Then (D.1) becomes\nR12 = A (4) dc \u2227 \u2329AB2B3B4\u232a> 0\u2227 c1 < 0\u2227 c2 > 0 \u2228 \u2329AB2B3B4\u232a< 0\u2227 c1 > 0\u2227 c2 < 0 , + , R34 = A (4) dc \u2227 \u2329AB2B3B4\u232a> 0\u2227 c1 > 0\u2227 c2 < 0 \u2228 \u2329AB2B3B4\u232a< 0\u2227 c1 < 0\u2227 c2 > 0\n, \u2212 , (D.2)\nand we see this has two external boundaries, c1 = 0 and c2 = 0, and one internal boundary at \u2329AB2B3B4\u232a = 0. The two external boundaries correspond to sending B1\u2192 B3 and B1\u2192 B2 respectively. The limit internal boundary \u2329AB2B3B4\u232a \u2192 0\u00b1 instead corresponds to sending B4 to the line P. In this case the geometry is described by the union of a positively oriented region R+1234 and a negatively oriented region R \u2212 1234 as\nR+1234 =A (4) dc \u2227 c1 < 0\u2227 c2 > 0 , + , R\u22121234 =A (4) dc \u2227 c1 > 0\u2227 c2 < 0 , \u2212 .\n(D.3)\nWe clearly see then recalling B1 = c1B2 + c2B3 that B1 cannot line in between the point B2 and B3 and the orientation depends on which side of B2, B3 B1 is on, with the position of B4 unconstrained.\nThis also reveals that there are still further loop-loop type boundaries we could take even after doing the point-plane-cut. We could take a residue at c2 = 0 or c3 = 0 corresponding to\nB1 = B2 or B3. The geometry we then obtain corresponds to the 3-loops maximal loop-loop cut A(3)mll but with weight 4 instead of 2 since this time we approached two internal boundaries that is \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a = 0 and \u2329AB2B3B4\u232a = 0. This implies that the residue corresponding to this 4-loop boundary is equal to 2 times the (C.12) all-in-one-point-and-plane 3-loop residue.\nLet\u2019s now go back to the all-in-one-point cut (82) and explore the only other boundary (modulo permutation of the loop variables), at \u2329AB2B1B4\u232a = 0. Notice that this time it is an external boundary since the 4 regions remain distinct. To be very explicit, we can approach the boundary by parametrizing B1 as c1B2 + c2B4 + c3Z\u2217 and then taking the limit c3 \u2192 0\u00b1 on (82), which becomes\nR1 = A (4) dc \u2227 c2\u2329AB2B3B4\u232a> 0 \u2227\u2212c1\u2329AB2B3B4\u232a> 0 , + , R2 = A (4) dc \u2227 c2\u2329AB2B3B4\u232a< 0 \u2227\u2212c1\u2329AB2B3B4\u232a> 0 , \u2212 , R3 = A (4) dc \u2227 c2\u2329AB2B3B4\u232a> 0 \u2227\u2212c1\u2329AB2B3B4\u232a< 0 , + , R4 = A (4) dc \u2227 c2\u2329AB2B3B4\u232a< 0 \u2227\u2212c1\u2329AB2B3B4\u232a< 0 , \u2212 ,\n(D.4)\nwhere the region 1 and 3 are positively oriented and 2 and 4 are negatively oriented. Here the geometry looks very similar to (D.2), but this time c1 = 0 is unconstrained while c2 is an external boundary. We can see that c1 is free by taking the union of R1 and R3 and expanding the products into the different sign cases. The same goes for the pair R2,R4 . Because of this we can actually rewrite the (D.4) as\nR13 = A (4) dc \u2227 c2\u2329AB2B3B4\u232a> 0 , + , R24 = A (4) dc \u2227 c2\u2329AB2B3B4\u232a< 0 , \u2212 .\n(D.5)\nThis in turn then has two boundaries, \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a = 0 and c2 = 0. Setting \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a = 0 obtained by sending B3 to P is described by the union of a positively oriented region and a negatively oriented region as\nR+1234 =A (4) dc c2 > 0 , + , R\u22121234 =A (4) dc c2 < 0 , \u2212 .\n(D.6)\nThis is the geometry of unconstrained points Bi with orientation depending on the relative order of B1, B2.\nThis point-plane configuration has a further (internal) loop-loop boundary at c2 = 0 corresponding to the limit B1\u2192 B2 . This boundary then consists of three unconstrained points on the line B2, B3, B4. This final configuration thus corresponds to the 3-loop maximal cut A (3) mll with weight 2."

            "text": "We here describe in detail the geometry corresponding to the specific all loop point-plane cut described in section 5.4.\nWe first take the simplest all-in-one-point cut boundary. In this all loops first intersect the line A1B1 and then they all slide to the same intersection point in the same order as their labeling. At L loops this is given by the inequalities (see (E.4))\nRsimplest dc = \u22c3\ns\u20d7\nRsimplest dcs\u20d7 ,\nRsimplest dcs\u20d7 =A dc \u2227 L \u2227\na=3\n\u2227\n2<i<a\n{sa\u2329ABiB1Ba\u232a> 0}\n, orientation= \u220f\na\nsa . (E.1)\nAfter taking the above all-in-one-point cut we then constrain all loops to lie in the same plane by taking the ordered series of boundaries {\u2329AB2B1BL\u232a= 0, \u2329AB2B1BL\u22121\u232a= 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u2329AB2B1B3\u232a= 0}. To do this, we will parametrize all loops, but B1 and B2, as Ba = B1+ baB2+ caZ\u2217 and we will take the limit ca \u2192 0\u00b1. We start by approaching the boundary \u2329AB2B1BL\u232a. What we obtain after this first limit is that for all i\nsL\u2329ABiB1BL\u232a> 0\u2192 sL bL\u2329ABiB1B2\u232a= \u2212sLsi bL < 0 . (E.2)\nSince this inequality must hold for all i we have that all si , apart from sL must be equal and we can therefore define a single sign s as\ns := sL\u22121 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7= s3 . (E.3)\nMoreover, we can see that bL is actually unconstrained. In fact, since for sL > 0 and sL < 0 we have the same orientation, (E.2) reduces to bL > 0\u2228 bL < 0. The boundary geometry is then given by\nRsimplest dc|\u2329A,B2B1BL\u232a=0 =R simplest dc s=1 |\u2329A,B2B1BL\u232a=0 \u222aR simplest dc s=\u22121 |\u2329A,B2B1BL\u232a=0 ,\nRsimplest dcs |\u2329A,B2B1BL\u232a=0 =Adc \u2227\nL\u22121 \u2227\na=3\n\u2227\n2<i< j\n{s\u2329ABiB1Ba\u232a> 0}\n, orientation= sL\u22124 . (E.4)\nNow let\u2019s take the residue \u2329A21BL\u22121\u232a= 0 by taking the limit cL \u2192 0\u00b1. What we obtain is that\ns\u2329ABiB1BL\u22121\u232a> 0= s\u2329ABiB1B2\u232abL\u22121 > 0= bL < 0 . (E.5)\nThis implies that bL\u22121\u2192 0\u2212 corresponds to an external boundary of the geometry. Notice also that now the orientation of the two components of the geometry labeled by s = 1 and s \u2212 1 will be given by sL\u22125. The series of boundaries \u2329AB2B1Ba\u232a= 0 have a clear recursive structure such that at each step a we get an inequality of the form ba < 0 and the orientation of the two components is equal to sL\u2212a\u22123. The recursion ends when we get to the last residue on \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a = 0, for which no brackets of the form \u2329ABiB1B3\u232a are present. At that point the two components \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a > 0 and \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a < 0 have the same boundary and opposite orientation and therefore this represents an internal boundary. We can conclude that the geometry of the simplest all-in-one-plane-and-point cut corresponds to\nRsimplest dcs,L | \u2227 a\u2329A,B2B1Ba\u232a=0 =A dc \u2227\nL\u22121 \u2227 a=4 ba < 0 , (E.6)\nwhere the weight of geometry is equal to 2 due to the internal boundary \u2329AB1B2B3\u232a = 0 contribution.\nAt this point it\u2019s straight forward to compute the canonical form of this region for the 4- point MHV amplitude. The inequalities ba < 0 for a = 4, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , L \u2212 1 simply tell us that on the line P all Ba must be on the same side of B1 as B2. So the full canonical form is as given in (105)."
