    "abstractText": "The aberrant aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S), a disordered protein primarily expressed in neuronal cells, is strongly associated with the underlying mechanisms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. It is now established that \u03b1S has a weak affinity for metal ions and that these interactions alter its conformational properties by generally promoting self-assembly into amyloids. Here, we characterised the nature of the conformational changes associated with metal binding by \u03b1S using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to measure the exchange of the backbone amide protons at a residue specific resolution. We complemented these experiments with N relaxation and chemical shift perturbations to obtain a comprehensive map of the interaction between \u03b1S and divalent (Ca, Cu, Mn, and Zn) and monovalent (Cu) metal ions. The data identified specific effects that the individual cations exert on the conformational properties of \u03b1S. In particular, binding to calcium and zinc generated a reduction of the protection factors in the C-terminal region of the protein, whereas both Cu(II) and Cu(I) did not alter the amide proton exchange along the \u03b1S sequence. Changes in the R2/R1 ratios from N relaxation experiments were, however, detected as a result of the interaction between \u03b1S and Cu or Zn, indicating that binding to these metals induces conformational perturbations in distinctive regions of the protein. Collectively our data suggest that multiple mechanisms of enhanced \u03b1S aggregation are associated with the binding of the analysed metals.",

It is now established that \u03b1S has a weak affinity for metal ions and that these interactions alter its conformational properties by generally promoting self-assembly into amyloids. Here, we characterised the nature of the conformational changes associated with metal binding by \u03b1S using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to measure the exchange of the backbone amide protons at a residue specific resolution. We complemented these experiments with 15N relaxation and chemical shift perturbations to obtain a comprehensive map of the interaction between \u03b1S and divalent (Ca2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+) and monovalent (Cu+) metal ions. The data identified specific effects that the individual cations exert on the conformational properties of \u03b1S. In particular, binding to calcium and zinc generated a reduction of the protection factors in the C-terminal region of the protein, whereas both Cu(II) and Cu(I) did not alter the amide proton exchange along the \u03b1S sequence. Changes in the R2/R1 ratios from 15N relaxation experiments were, however, detected as a result of the interaction between \u03b1S and Cu+ or Zn2+, indicating that binding to these metals induces conformational perturbations in distinctive regions of the protein. Collectively our data suggest that multiple mechanisms of enhanced \u03b1S aggregation are associated with the binding of the analysed metals.\nKEYWORDS\n\u03b1-synuclein, NMR, amide exchange, aggregation, metal interaction\n1 Introduction\n\u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1S) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that is primarily expressed in neuronal cells and whose aggregation is strongly associated with debilitating neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as synucleinopathies, which include Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system amyotrophy (Spillantini et al., 1997; Uversky and Eliezer, 2009; Luk et al., 2012; Lashuel et al., 2013; Chiti and Dobson, 2017; Fusco et al., 2017; Newberry et al., 2020). Amyloid fibrils of \u03b1S are indeed the major constituents of aberrant inclusions, designated as Lewy bodies, forming in neurons of patients affected by PD (Lashuel et al., 2013; Lee and Masliah, 2015). There are also genetic links between synucleinopathies and \u03b1S, with a number of missense mutations, duplications and triplications of the gene encoding \u03b1S being identified in association with familial forms"

It is generally believed that the biological activity of \u03b1S is inextricably linked to its ability to bind biological membranes (Snead and Eliezer, 2014). This interaction is recursively involved in the major putative neuronal roles of \u03b1S (Burre, 2015), and has been shown to promote \u03b1S aggregation (Auluck et al., 2010) and the mechanisms of neurotoxicity induced by its aggregates (Fusco et al., 2017).\nA fundamental interaction of \u03b1S involves metal ions, including divalent cations such as Cu2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, as well as Ca2+. The latter divalent cation, a key messenger in neurotransmission, was also shown to alter the conformations and membrane interactions of \u03b1S (Lautenschlager et al., 2018). There is a crucial interest on the role of metals in PD as their dishomeostasis is increasingly recognised to play a critical role in the development of this disease. In addition, numerous evidences indicate that metal interactions promote aberrant aggregation of \u03b1S (Fink, 2006; Binolfi et al., 2008; Binolfi et al., 2010; Deas et al., 2016), including Ca2+ (Stephens et al., 2020), Mn2+ (Uversky et al., 2001; Verina et al., 2013), Zn2+ (Sato et al., 2013) and Cu2+ (Montes et al., 2014). \u03b1S has also been shown to interact with Cu+, a binding implicated in the formation of reactive oxygen species inducing toxicity in dopaminergic neurons (Wang et al., 2010). The modes of metal binding by \u03b1S are variegated. Generally, the significant presence of negatively charged residues in the C-terminal region of \u03b1S promotes electrostatic interactions with cations, whereas His 50 and Met residues in the N-terminal region provide additional interaction loci for some metal cations (Supplementary Figure S1).\nIn order to understand the role of metal binding in the pathophysiology of \u03b1S it is therefore critical to characterise the subtle conformational alterations of \u03b1S associated with these interactions. It is indeed currently generally acknowledged that long-range interactions between the negatively charged C-terminus and the positively charged N-terminal region of \u03b1S promote an aggregation-resistant conformational ensemble whereby the amyloidogenic NAC region is partially protected from engaging in dangerous self-assembly and aggregation (Dedmon et al., 2005). Alterations of this conformational ensemble, such as, for example, those induced by Ca2+ binding at the C-terminal region, have been shown to modify the properties of \u03b1S in such a way to increase the exposure of the NAC, ultimately leading to its aggregation (Stephens et al., 2020).\nThe metal interaction by \u03b1S has been extensively studied using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Rasia et al., 2005; Binolfi et al., 2006; Binolfi et al., 2008; Binolfi et al., 2010; Binolfi et al., 2011; Miotto et al., 2014; Miotto et al., 2015; Villar-Pique et al., 2017; Lautenschlager et al., 2018; Gonzalez et al., 2019; Pontoriero et al., 2020), and here we applied NMR to probe the backbone protection factors of \u03b1S upon interaction with divalent (Ca2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+) and monovalent (Cu+) metal ions. In particular, we used phase-modulated CLEAN chemical exchange (CLEANEX) to directly monitor the H-H exchange of amide protons with the solvent, as previously employed for the isolated \u03b1S (Okazaki\net al., 2013), and complemented these experiments with 15N relaxation to collectively probe conformational dynamics on various of timescales. The data collectively mapped the effects that individual metal ions exert on the conformational properties of \u03b1S upon binding, thereby suggesting the nature of the structural perturbations by which these metals trigger \u03b1S aggregation."

N-terminal acetylation of \u03b1S was obtained by co-expression with a plasmid encoding the components of the NatB complex (Maltsev et al., 2012). 15N and/or 13C-labelled \u03b1S was expressed in M9 minimal media containing 1 g/L of 15N ammonium chloride and 3 g/L of 13C-glucose. To enhance the N-terminal acetylation of \u03b1S, 1 g of ISOGRO\u00ae 15N-13C was added. The bacterial culture was supplemented with 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin, together with 100 \u00b5g/mL chloramphenicol for cultures coexpressing both plasmids where N-terminal acetylation was desired, and incubated at 37\u00b0C under constant shaking at 200 rpm to an OD600 of 0.6\u20131.0. Expression was induced through the addition of 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and overnight incubation under constant shaking at 28\u00b0C.\nThe cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 6,200 x g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C (Beckman Coulter Brea, United States), the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 M PBS and centrifuged again at 24 500 x g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Each pellet was then resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.7, 1 mM EDTA and \u00bd of an EDTA-free complete\u2122 protease inhibitor cocktail tablet) and lysed by sonication on ice (2 s on, 4 s off, total time 8 min). The sonicated samples where then centrifuged at 24 500 x g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C to remove the cell debris as pellets. The supernatant was then heated for 20 min at 94\u00b0C to precipitate heat-sensitive proteins. A further centrifugation step at 24 500 x g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C followed to remove the precipitated protein fraction. Subsequently, the supernatant was treated with 10 mg/mL of streptomycin sulfate to induce DNA precipitation.

In agreement with previous studies (Lautenschlager et al., 2018; Stephens et al., 2020), Ca2+ was found to induce CSP in the acidic C-terminus of \u03b1S under the present experimental conditions (Figure 1). This binding is mediated by Asp and Glu residues that are abundant in the region 110\u2013140 (Supplementary Figure S1). In order to sample slow protein motions, we measured amide exchange protection factors through CLEANEX NMR. These experiments revealed high LogP values in correspondence of theC-terminal region of the isolated \u03b1S (Supplementary Figure S3), an observation that is in line with previous NMR studies (Okazaki et al., 2013) as well as orthogonal measurements of mass spec (Stephens et al., 2020). This pattern of C-terminal protection, which is conserved in both N-terminally acetylated and non-acetylated forms of \u03b1S (Supplementary Figure S3), has been ascribed to the local concentration of negative charges in the \u03b1S sequence (Okazaki et al., 2013). In the presence of\ncalcium, CLEANEX revealed alterations of the protection factors of \u03b1S, primarily in correspondence of the C-terminal region of the protein where reductions up to 0.6 in LogP values were observed. These data are in apparent contrast with previous mass spec analyses (Stephens et al., 2020; Seetaloo et al., 2022), likely due to differences in the timescales of the exchange process probed by the two techniques. Both experiments, however, provide converging indication that calcium binding disrupts the electrostatically driven transient interactions between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of \u03b1S, which were observed using NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (Dedmon et al., 2005).\nTo further study the Ca2+ interaction by \u03b1S, we then employed 15N-relaxation. The data showed no significant alterations in the R2/R1 values upon calciumbinding, including residues of theC-terminal region (Figure 1E), suggesting that the metal interaction induces no specific conformational exchange in the intermediate NMR timescale.We noted a slight increase in the longitudinal relaxation rates (R1) in correspondence of the C-terminal region of \u03b1S (residues 105\u2013140), which is consistent with the region showing the strongest CSP and LogP\nFIGURE 1 NMR analysis of Ca2+ binding to \u03b1S.

For these experiments, in order to reduce broadening of the NMR resonances due to paramagnetic effects, we employed a 1:5 ratio of copper:\u03b1S (85 \u03bcM: 415 \u03bcM), and maintained this ratio for both Cu+ and Cu2+ analyses. In the case of Cu+, in order to ensure the optimal oxidation state of copper, we used an excess of sodium ascorbate (see Section 2). The latter was found to induce no conformational changes in \u03b1S, as the 1H-15N HSQC of the protein resulted unperturbed in the presence of the reducing agent. By contrast, the presence of Cu+ andCu2+ was found to induce considerable CSP to the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of\n\u03b1S, particularly in three regions of the protein sequence that include the N-terminus, the residues flanking His50, and the C-terminus (Figure 2). The strongest effects were observed in the case of Cu+, and particularly in correspondence of the N-terminal 13 residues of \u03b1S. Despite the considerable levels of CSP, no significant alterations of the protection factors of \u03b1S were detected upon copper interaction (Figure 2C). More specifically, only a slight increase in the protection factors at the N-terminus of \u03b1S upon Cu+ binding was observed up to a value of +0.3 in LogP, whereas binding of Cu2+ did not induce any significant change in the measured protection factors of the protein. While monomer depletion was not observed during the present measurements (Supplementary Figure S2), indicating that no significant aggregation occurred during the data acquisition, it is possible that dimerization events induced by Cu+ (Abeyawardhane et al., 2018) may have contributed to the changes in the measured protection factors.\nWhen analysing the 15N relaxation of \u03b1S upon the interaction with copper, we observed a strong increase in R2/R1 values in some protein regions in the presence of Cu+ (Figure 2D).

Zinc interactionwas found also to induce alterations of the protection factors of \u03b1S, with significant reductions of the LogP values of the C-terminal region of the protein (Figure 3C). In addition, Zn2+ binding strongly perturbed the relaxation properties of \u03b1S, with significant alterations in R2/R1 values in proximity of His 50 and Asp121 (Figure 3D). Collectively these NMR data indicate specific zinc binding in two regions of \u03b1S resulting in conformational exchange in the intermediate timescale in the regions flanking residues 50 and 121 aswell as enhanced solvent exchange in the C-terminal region of the protein.\nFinally, the incubation of Mn2+ generated very minor CSP primarily localised in the C-terminal region of \u03b1S (Supplementary Figure S4).\nBecause of broadening effects upon manganese binding, in the C-terminal region of \u03b1S protection factors could be obtained only for very few residues (Supplementary Figure S4C), indicating generally no perturbation in the local solvent exchange. By contrast, enhanced R2/R1 values were observed in correspondence in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the protein (residues M1, G25, A27, G36, G51, Q99, L100, G101, K102, N103, E104, E105, A107, E110, G111, and I112). It is worth noting that Mn2+ can induce enhanced transverse relaxation in NMR resonances, thereby possibly altering R2/R1 values as a result of the paramagnetic effect. In this case, changes in R2/R1 may not exclusively reflect alterations in the conformational ensemble of \u03b1S."

Despite these evidences, however, the role of metal dishomeostasis in PD is not fully understood and remains strongly debated. It has been extensively shown that metals can enhance the aggregation of \u03b1S by inducing the misfolding of \u03b1S into amyloid-prone species promoting fibrillization (Binolfi et al., 2006; Fink, 2006; Binolfi et al., 2008; Binolfi et al., 2010; Deas et al., 2016). The enhancement of \u03b1S aggregation has been observed in conjunction with numerous cations such as Ca2+ (Stephens et al., 2020), Mn2+ (Uversky et al., 2001; Verina et al., 2013), Zn2+ (Sato et al., 2013), Cu2+ (Montes et al., 2014) and Cu+ (Wang et al., 2010). We here focussed on these specific metals to aim at a detailed characterisation of their binding modes with \u03b1S. In order to generate new understanding of the effects of these interactions on the conformational properties of \u03b1S, using NMR CLEANEX we probed how the metals affect the amide protection factors of the protein. These experiments are specifically tailored to probe H/H exchange in solvent exposed regions of protein molecules (De Simone et al., 2011; Fusco et al., 2022) and IDPs (Hwang et al., 1998; Okazaki et al., 2013). Other NMR measurements of proton exchange of \u03b1S have shown that the cellular environment does not alter the rates of exchange (Smith et al., 2015), making this technique a fine probe of the conformational properties of \u03b1S in the crowded cellular environment. Backbone amide exchange is indeed specifically sensitive to slow backbone dynamics in proteins and perturbations of this process provide evidence of key conformational changes in IDPs, such as, for example, the formation of local hydrogen bonds.\nOur data indicate that the individual metal ions have distinctive modes of binding with \u03b1S and induce specific perturbations of its amide protection factors. The binding signatures of each metal are even more unique when considering CSP and 15N relaxation data in addition to LogP. In particular, strong effects on the protection factors were observed in the presence of Ca2+ and Zn2+, with both cases associated with a reduction of LogP values of the C-terminal region of \u03b1S. In the presence of calcium, CSP were observed primarily in the C-terminal region of \u03b1S, suggesting only a local involvement in the metal binding, whereas upon zinc interaction CSPwere observed also in the region proximal to His50. Moreover, calcium binding did not induce significant perturbations in 15N relaxation of \u03b1S while zinc was found to strongly enhance R2/R1 values in proximity of residue His50 and the C-terminal region of \u03b1S. These data indicate that the conformational changes that zinc induces on \u03b1S are different from those induced by calcium, with the first affecting the local conformations in two spots of the protein and the second influencing primarily the properties of the C-terminal region. In addition to zinc and calcium binding, we also found that copper-\u03b1S interactions have unique signatures. Copper binding indeed generates CSPs in three regions of the protein, including the N-terminus, the region in proximity of residue His 50 and the C-terminus, with perturbations induced by Cu+ found to be significantly stronger than those associated with Cu2+. The incubation with both types of copper cations did not affect significantly the protection factors of \u03b1S, whereas conformational changes probed by 15N relaxation indicated rearrangements of the N-terminal region upon Cu+ as revealed by R2/R1 values.\nTaken together our results indicate that, although all the metal ions here studied accelerate \u03b1S aggregation, they attain different binding modes with the protein suggesting that multiple mechanisms of enhanced aggregation may occur as a result of these interactions. Understanding the nature of these mechanisms is therefore critical if\nwe are to reveal the connection between metal dis-homeostasis and \u03b1S aggregation in the context of PD. A key challenge in this research area will be the characterization of synergic effects of the metal ions in their multiple interactions with \u03b1S, and how these are related with the various phases of the normal and pathological neuronal activity."
