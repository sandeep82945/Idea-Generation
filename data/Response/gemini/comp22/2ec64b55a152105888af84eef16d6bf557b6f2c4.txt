1. **Investigate the impact of different control variables on the performance of the contextual Shewhart chart.** The paper uses outdoor temperature as the contextual variable, but other potential candidates include forward flow, forward temperature, and return pressure. It would be interesting to see how the performance of the chart changes when using different control variables.
2. **Apply the contextual Shewhart chart to other types of district heating systems.** The paper applies the chart to a pumping substation, but it could also be applied to other types of district heating systems, such as heat exchangers or boilers. It would be interesting to see how the chart performs in these different contexts.
3. **Develop a more robust methodology for determining the interval size of the contextual variable.** The paper uses a trial-and-error approach to determine the interval size, which is not ideal. A more robust methodology would help to ensure that the chart is always using the optimal interval size.
4. **Investigate the use of machine learning to improve the performance of the contextual Shewhart chart.** Machine learning could be used to learn the relationship between the control variable and the process variable, which could then be used to improve the accuracy of the chart.
5. **Develop a software tool for implementing the contextual Shewhart chart.** A software tool would make it easier for practitioners to use the chart in their own applications. The tool could include features such as automatic interval size selection and machine learning-based anomaly detection.
