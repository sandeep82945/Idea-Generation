1. **Investigate the in vivo efficacy of CDFHCD against PDAC:** Evaluate the antitumor activity of CDFHCD in animal models of PDAC to determine its therapeutic potential in vivo. Assess tumor growth inhibition, survival rates, and toxicity profiles to establish the efficacy and safety of CDFHCD as a potential treatment for PDAC.


2. **Explore the molecular mechanisms underlying CDFHCD's anticancer effects:** Conduct mechanistic studies to elucidate the specific molecular pathways and targets involved in CDFHCD's antitumor activity. Investigate the modulation of signaling pathways, regulation of gene expression, and alterations in cellular processes induced by CDFHCD treatment in PDAC cells.


3. **Evaluate the potential of CDFHCD to overcome drug resistance in PDAC:** Determine whether CDFHCD can circumvent drug resistance mechanisms commonly observed in PDAC, such as efflux pumps, altered drug metabolism, and genetic mutations. Assess the efficacy of CDFHCD in drug-resistant PDAC cell lines or patient-derived xenografts to explore its potential as a strategy to overcome resistance and improve treatment outcomes.


4. **Investigate the pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties of CDFHCD:** Conduct pharmacokinetic studies to determine the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profile of CDFHCD in vivo. Evaluate the bioavailability, tissue distribution, and elimination pathways of CDFHCD to optimize its formulation and dosing regimen for clinical translation.


5. **Assess the safety and tolerability of CDFHCD in preclinical models:** Perform comprehensive toxicity studies in animal models to evaluate the safety profile of CDFHCD. Investigate potential adverse effects, organ toxicity, and long-term consequences of CDFHCD treatment to ensure its safety for clinical use.
