Given the extensive and detailed nature of the text you've provided, which covers a wide range of topics related to the use of natural cross-linking agents in the preparation of hydrogels for various applications, it's clear that the focus is on the advantages, applications, and potential future directions of using natural cross-linkers over synthetic ones. However, specific sentences or portions directly mentioning future research directions are not explicitly highlighted in the provided text. 

To extract and quote potential future research directions from the context and the nature of the discussion in the text, one might infer the following:

1. "Therefore, it is worth considering the use of natural cross-linking agents such as genipin, citric acid, tannic acid, epigallocatechin gallate as well as vanillin, which produce safer hydrogels for biomedical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic use." This suggests a future research direction towards exploring and expanding the use of these natural cross-linking agents in various industries due to their safety and effectiveness.

2. "Recent developments in the field of hydrogel production have led to the more frequent use of natural cross-linkers." This indicates a trend and a potential direction for future research to further investigate and innovate in the production of hydrogels using natural cross-linkers.

3. "The advanced applications and future direction of hydrogels are presented in Figure 14." Although the content of Figure 14 is not described, this statement implies that there are identified advanced applications and future directions for hydrogels that could be explored in subsequent research.

These inferences suggest that future research in this field may focus on further exploring the efficacy, applications, and benefits of natural cross-linking agents in hydrogel production, as well as their impact on environmental sustainability and human health.
