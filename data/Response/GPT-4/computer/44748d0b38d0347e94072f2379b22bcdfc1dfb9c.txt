Interdisciplinary Integration for Enhanced DT Implementation: Investigate the integration of Digital Twin (DT) technology with other fields such as urban planning, environmental science, and sociology to develop more comprehensive and sustainable DT frameworks. This research could explore how DT can be utilized not only for building and infrastructure management but also for broader urban and environmental planning, including the simulation of urban growth, environmental impacts, and the social implications of DT implementation.

Improving Data Interoperability and Management: Focus on overcoming the challenges of data interoperability and management in the DT paradigm. This includes developing standardized protocols and frameworks for data exchange and integration across different platforms and technologies (e.g., BIM, IoT, AI). The goal would be to facilitate seamless communication between digital twins and other digital systems, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of data use in construction, operations, and maintenance.

AI and Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance and Operations: Conduct research on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to predict maintenance needs and operational efficiencies in the DT framework. This could involve developing models that can predict failures or identify optimization opportunities in real-time, thereby reducing downtime and extending the lifespan of infrastructure and facilities.

User-Friendly DT Interfaces for Non-Expert Users: Explore the development of more intuitive and accessible DT interfaces and tools that do not require high digital literacy. The focus would be on creating solutions that can be easily used by personnel with varying levels of technical expertise, potentially incorporating augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to visualize DT data and simulations in a more user-friendly manner.

Case Studies on DT Implementation in Various Sectors: Carry out detailed case studies on the implementation of DT across different sectors beyond construction and manufacturing, such as healthcare, retail, and education. These case studies would provide insights into the unique challenges and benefits of DT in various contexts, offering a roadmap for future DT implementations and identifying best practices for leveraging DT technology across diverse industries.
