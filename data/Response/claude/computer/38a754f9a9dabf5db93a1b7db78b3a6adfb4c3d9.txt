 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Developing more complex models that incorporate additional compartments and factors influencing obesity, overweight, and diabetes. For example, splitting the population into different age groups or incorporating genetic predispositions. 

2. Performing model calibration and validation using real-world data on obesity, overweight, diabetes prevalence over time. This could improve model accuracy and predictive capabilities.

3. Incorporating the effects of specific intervention strategies into the model, such as public health campaigns, taxation of unhealthy foods, or subsidies for nutrition and exercise programs. The model could then be used to estimate and compare the potential impacts of different interventions.

4. Expanding the model to become an agent-based model where individuals have heterogeneous attributes and interact on a contact network. This could provide insights into how social networks influence obesity spread.

5. Applying optimal control theory to find the best strategies for allocating limited public health resources to curb obesity and diabetes. The controls could be parameters like the contact rate in the model.
