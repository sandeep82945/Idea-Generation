    "abstractText": "A spinal cord injury (SCI) is the devastating trauma associated with functional deterioration due to apoptosis. Most laboratory SCI models are generated by a direct impact on an animal\u2019s spinal cord; however, our model does not involve the direct impact on the spinal cord. Instead, we use a clamp compression to create an ischemia in the descending aortas of mice. Following the success of inducing an ischemic SCI (ISCI), we hypothesized that this model may show apoptosis via an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway. This apoptosis by the ER stress pathway is enhanced by the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The ER is used for the protein folding in the cell. When the protein folding capacity is overloaded, the condition is termed the ER stress and is characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins inside the ER lumen. The unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathways that deal with the ER stress response then become activated. This UPR activates the three signal pathways that are regulated by the inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1), the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK). IRE1\u03b1 and PERK are associated with the expression of the apoptotic proteins. Apoptosis caused by an ISCI is assessed using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) test. An ISCI also reduces synaptophysin and the neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN) in the spinal cord. In conclusion, an ISCI increases the ER stress proteins, resulting in apoptosis in neuronal cells in the spinal cord.",

            "text": "An ischemic spinal cord injury (ISCI) is a complication after a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, which causes injury to the nerves and leads to sensory and motor deficits, as well as widespread disabilities [1]. An ISCI seriously affects the quality of life in approximately 5% to 10% of patients [2]. Different studies have disclosed the pathophysiology of an ISCI, which includes the neuronal inflammation, oxidative stress, reactive changes in the glia, neuronal degeneration, and apoptosis [3]. The SCI pathology is divided in two stages: the first is caused by a direct effect on the spinal cord, and the second is caused by inflammation, the vascular dysfunction, autophagy, oxidative stress, and neuronal apoptosis [4\u20136]. Free radicals are produced after a SCI [7]. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressed in the cells is responsible for the damage and inflammation. It contributes to a high production of nitric oxide (NO), which leads to the formation of free radicals and ultimately to apoptosis [8]. A SCI causes a reduction in the neuronal markers, such as the neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN) and synaptic markers, such as synaptophysin [9,10]. Following a SCI, some of the cells die, due to the post-traumatic necrosis, whereas other neuronal cells die by apoptosis [11]. We are more focused on apoptosis in our current experiment.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1307. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24021307 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1307 2 of 14\nApoptosis is a programmed cell death that is increased under pathological conditions, it can also take place in physiological conditions [12]. During apoptosis, there is shrinkage of the cell membrane forming bleb and the formation of double membraned autolysosomes during autophagy. This is different from necroptosis, where there is swelling of the cell membrane [13,14]. Neurons and oligodendrocytes both show an apoptotic cell death [15]. Apoptosis inhibits the nerve function following a SCI [16]. It has been demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress encourages apoptosis [17]. The ER is a cellular organelle found throughout the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells [18]. During a SCI, an unfolded protein response (UPR) occurs, due to a large number of misfolding proteins, caused by the changes in the microenvironment in the injured tissue [9]. This UPR activates three signal pathways that are regulated by the inositol-requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1), activating the transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) [19,20]. IRE1\u03b1 and PERK show the expression of apoptotic proteins and it leads to the neuronal death [21]. A time course experiment in rats showed that apoptosis occurred, as early as 4 h post-injury and could be seen in decreasing amounts, as late as 3 weeks after a SCI [22]. However, this type of SCI is performed in rats, and most of the models are made by contusion injuries. We are first to show an ER stress resulting in apoptosis in a mouse model of an ISCI prepared by the occlusion of the descending aorta. This model mimics a patient undergoing cardiovascular surgery with paralysis, following the surgical procedure. In this mouse model, the seizures and paralysis are seen approximately 40\u201348 h postoperatively. This is the reason we did not look for apoptosis 24\u201348 h postoperatively. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent of apoptosis caused by an ER stress in the spinal cord of ISCI mice."

A benefit of our model is that the spinal cord\nwas not morphologically affected, while there were massive histological changes in the\nspinal cord [24].

The unfolded proteins upregulate the expression of chaperones, such as GRP-78. GRP-78 then instigates the activation of the pPERK and pIRE signaling pathways [34,35].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 1307 8 of 14\nWhen ER stress occurs, there is oligomerization and phosphorylation of the PERK, which leads to the phosphorylation of Eif-2 and the activation of the p-eIF2 pathway [36]. Phosphorylation of eIF2 further upregulates ATF-4, which targets the activation of the apoptotic protein CHOP [32,37,38]. The CHOP activates either of the pro-apoptotic BH3 only proteins, such as Bim, Bid, Bad, Bmf, Noxa, and PUMA. These proteins are able to bind and activate the direct effectors Bak and Bax [39]. Another signaling pathway that is activated by GRP-78 is pIRE. This is the most studied activation mechanism [40]. IRE1 activates the inflammatory response and the cellular apoptosis-associated protein kinases, especially the apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which leads to the phosphorylation of two pathways, including p38 MAPK and JNK. The phosphorylated p38 MAPK and JNK further leads to the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bak and Bax [32,41,42]. Bak and Bax, once activated, form an oligomer and eventually make pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This leads to the permeability of the outer mitochondria [37,39,43]. Then, the pro-apoptotic proteins are released from the inner membrane to cytosol, that initiates the caspase activation which subsequently results in apoptosis [39]. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that the ER-stress-activated pathways play a significant role in apoptosis in a SCI [9,44]. The pathological processes following a SCI occur due to oxidative stress, such as the formation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species, and the free radicals, as well as inflammation [45,46]. The main source of NO is iNOS [46], and it is an important marker for the ROS-induced free radicals [47]. ER stress and oxidative stress are bidirectionally related, and the aggregation of the unfolded proteins in the ER lumen is enough to trigger the production of the ROS [47\u201349]. If the ER protein homeostasis is not restored and there is excessive oxidative stress, apoptotic cell death may occur via the upregulation of the CHOP, PUMA, Bax, followed by the cleaved caspase 3 [47,50,51]. There are some pharmacological drugs that makes the modulation in PERK and IRE pathway, that eventually leads to a therapeutic benefit. These drugs are rapamycin, AMPK activators, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) [52]. Rapamycin weakens the apoptosis induced by ER stress via the suppression of the IRE1-JNK signaling pathway [53]. The AMPK activators attenuate the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 \u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) and the JNK signaling pathways [54]. The DPP-IV inhibitors protect against the ER stress-induced apoptosis and inflammation through the IRE1\u03b1/JNK-p38 and PERK/CHOP -mediated pathways [55]. ARBs attenuate the ER stress mediated apoptosis by the suppression of the glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), ATF4, and CHOP [56]. In our research, we demonstrated that the ER stress induced apoptosis, in response to an ISCI and the levels of proteins that activate apoptosis, including the GRP78, CHOP, PUMA, Bax, and the cleaved caspase-3, were significantly higher in mice with an ISCI, based on the western blot and IHC. A TUNEL assay also showed the elevated numbers of apoptotic cells in an ISCI. As intermediary signaling molecules associated with the ER stress pathway, these proteins mediate the apoptosis through different pathways, such as the IREASK1-p38MAPK- pJNK-Bax- cleaved caspase-3, and the PERK-elF2a- ATF4-CHOP-PUMABax pathways. A schematic diagram of an ISCI\u2013ER stress\u2013oxidative stress\u2013apoptosis is shown in (Figure 8)."

Antibiotics were administered topically (Fucidine, Leopharma, Ballerup, Denmark) and subcutaneously (Kuhnil Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Each mouse was continuously monitored for 40\u201348 h for seizures, followed by paralysis. Complete paralysis of the hind limbs was considered to be the best model of an ISCI. The surgical method was followed according to Awad et al. [21]."

Locomotor recovery following a SCI was identified by the scoring of the hind limb performance in an open field arena, using the BMS scoring system. Under blinded conditions, the locomotion score was determined within a period of 4 min. It ranges from 0\u20139, where 0 denotes no ankle movement and 9 denotes frequent stepping [57]. The BMS was evaluated for seven days."
