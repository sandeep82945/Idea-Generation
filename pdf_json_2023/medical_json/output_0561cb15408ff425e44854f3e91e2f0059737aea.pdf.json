    "abstractText": "Bacterial pathogens often make use of post-translational modifications to manipulate host cells. Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires disease, secretes the enzyme AnkX that uses cytidine diphosphate-choline to post-translationallymodify the human small G-Protein Rab1 with a phosphocholine moiety at Ser76. Later in the infection, the Legionella enzyme Lem3 acts as a dephosphocholinase, hydrolytically removing the phosphocholine. While the molecular mechanism for Rab1 phosphocholination by AnkX has recently been resolved, structural insights into the activity of Lem3 remained elusive. Here, we stabilise the transient Lem3:Rab1b complex by substratemediated covalent capture. Through crystal structures of Lem3 in the apo form and in complex with Rab1b, we reveal Lem3\u2019s catalytic mechanism, showing that it acts on Rab1 by locally unfolding it. Since Lem3 shares high structural similarity with metal-dependent protein phosphatases, our Lem3:Rab1b complex structure also sheds light on how these phosphatases recognise protein substrates.",

Kaspers 1,6, Vivian Pogenberg 1,6, Christian Pett 2, Stefan Ernst3, Felix Ecker 4, Philipp Ochtrop 2, Michael Groll 4, Christian Hedberg 2 & Aymelt Itzen 1,5\nBacterial pathogens often make use of post-translational modifications to manipulate host cells. Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires disease, secretes the enzyme AnkX that uses cytidine diphosphate-choline to post-translationallymodify the human small G-Protein Rab1 with a phosphocholine moiety at Ser76. Later in the infection, the Legionella enzyme Lem3 acts as a dephosphocholinase, hydrolytically removing the phosphocholine. While the molecular mechanism for Rab1 phosphocholination by AnkX has recently been resolved, structural insights into the activity of Lem3 remained elusive. Here, we stabilise the transient Lem3:Rab1b complex by substratemediated covalent capture. Through crystal structures of Lem3 in the apo form and in complex with Rab1b, we reveal Lem3\u2019s catalytic mechanism, showing that it acts on Rab1 by locally unfolding it. Since Lem3 shares high structural similarity with metal-dependent protein phosphatases, our Lem3:Rab1b complex structure also sheds light on how these phosphatases recognise protein substrates.\nLegionella pneumophila is a gram-negative bacterium that causes Legionnaires\u2019 disease by infecting human alveolar macrophages. After phagocytosis by the immune cell, the bacterium escapes the cellular defence mechanisms by forming a replicative organelle referred to as the Legionella containing vacuole (LCV). Crucial to the evasion of host defence is the release of about 330 bacterial proteins (also known as bacterial effectors) through the type IV secretion system1\u20134.\nAmong the many host targets of the bacterial effectors are Rab proteins, in particular the small G-protein Rab1b, which acts as a central regulatory hub in vesicular trafficking5. Rab1b functions as a molecular switch that is in the inactive state when binding to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and active when binding to guanosine triphosphate (GTP). In the active state, Rab1b promotes vesicular trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to theGolgi apparatus through the recruitment of GTP-state specific interaction partners. Rab1b activation is catalysed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that replaces the tightly bound GDP with GTP, whereas inactivation is stimulated byGTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that produce the inactive form by accelerating the intrinsic GTP-hydrolysis activity of Rab1b6,7. Active Rab-proteins (and thus also Rab1b) are localized to intracellular membranes by means of post-translationally attached geranylgeranyl moieties8. In the inactive state, Rab1b is extracted from the membrane to the cytosol through complexation with the protein GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI).\nReceived: 7 October 2022\nAccepted: 22 March 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Institute of Biochemistry and Signal Transduction, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), Martinistr. 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany. 2Chemical Biology Center (KBC), Department of Chemistry, Ume\u00e5 University, Linnaeus v\u00e4g 10, 90187 Ume\u00e5, Sweden. 3Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM), Department Chemistry, Technical University of Munich, Lichtenbergstrasse 4, 85747 Garching, Germany. 4Center for Protein Assemblies, Technical University of Munich, Ernst-Otto-Fischer-Str. 8, 85748 Garching, Germany. 5Centre for Structural Systems Biology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), Martinistr. 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany. 6These authors contributed equally: Marietta S.

In total, six different Legionella effectors are involved in manipulating Rab1b in this process: DrrA/ SidM contains a GEF and an AMPylation domain, leading to Rab1b activation and AMPylation, respectively11\u201313. AMPylation is a posttranslational modification (PTM) in which adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is transferred from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to proteins. Here, Y77 of Rab1b gets AMPylated, likely leading to changing interactionprofiles of Rab1b and activating it14. Also, the effector LidA from Legionella can bind AMPylated and non-AMPylated Rab1b12. At later stages of infection, the Legionella effectors SidD and LepB lead to deAMPylation and GTP-hydrolysis, thereby reconstituting the inactive state of Rab1b15,16.\nIn addition, Rab1b undergoes another PTM: The effector AnkX makes use of the nucleotide cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-choline and transfers a phosphocholine (PC) group to S76Rab1b (a process referred to as phosphocholination), resulting in a phosphodiester-linked choline modification at this site17. Phosphocholination impairs Rab1b interactions with GAPs and GDI18. In addition, the Legionella protein Lem3 can hydrolytically cleave the phosphocholine group (i.e. dephosphocholination) and reconstitute the unmodified Rab1b protein18,19. It has to be noted that protein phosphocholination and its enzymatic mechanism are barely studied in human proteins.\nOur recent work has provided detailed functional and structural data on the mechanism of Rab1b phosphocholination by Legionella effector AnkX20. However, the structural mechanism by which Lem3 cleaves the phosphocholine group has not yet been analysed due to the transient nature of the complex. Protein remote homology detection and three-dimensional structure prediction of Lem3 using HHpred strongly suggested that the protein shares structural homology to the Mg2+/Mn2+-dependant protein phosphatases (PPMs)21,22. Phosphatases hydrolytically cleave phosphorylated amino acids. In this context, the PPM1A-family (also referred to as PP2C) is specific for phosphorylated serine (pS) and phosphorylated threonine (pT). Dephosphorylation is dependent on divalent cations (frequently Mg2+ or Mn2+) in the enzymes\u2019 active centre that are coordinated by a network of aspartates and glutamates23,24. It has been suggested that the cations stimulate catalysis through charge compensation of the phosphate and water activation as these entities are also coordinated to the metal centre25.\nThe structural investigation of the complex between Rab1b and Lem3 is hampered by the low affinity of their interaction, thereby not permitting quantitative complex preparation. In this work, we applied a site-specific covalent method to link Rab1b and Lem3 through a phosphocholine derivative. Thanks to this approach, we were able to solve the crystal structures of the Lem3 apo-form and the covalent Lem3:Rab1b complex."

Lem321-486 possesses full catalytic activity in regard to dephosphocholination of Rab1b phosphocholinated at Ser76, indicating that the N- and C-terminal regions of Lem3 are not involved in catalysis (Fig. 1a). We solved the structures of Lem3FL and Lem321-486 at 3.6 \u00c5 and 2.2 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. The Lem321-486 structure was solved experimentally using the anomalous dispersion from heavy atoms incorporated to the protein by soaking (Supplementary Table 1). In parallel, Lem321-486 was modelled using AlphaFold2 (AF2)\n26. A superimposition of the Lem321-486 crystal and the AF2-predicted structure revealed high similarity (0.88 \u00c5 RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) on 444 superimposed C\u03b1-atoms) (Supplementary Fig. 1a).\nFurthermore, we were able to solve the structure of Lem3FL by molecular replacement using the short construct structure and further extend the building of the C-terminal part with help of the AF2 model of Lem3FL (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 1)\n27. Overall, Lem3 has a scalene triangular shape, formed by 17 \u03b2strands and 20 \u03b1-helices (Fig. 1b, c). Metaphorically, the core domain folds into a fist and a raised thumb, the latter consisting of helices \u03b19\u03b113. The extended \u03b1-helix \u03b19 appears to play the role of the first metacarpal bone which links the thumb to the palm. Lem3FL extends the fist opposite from the thumb by three \u03b1-helices (\u03b118-\u03b120, aa 495- 567). Together with \u03b1-helices \u03b114-\u03b117, these three helices form a helical bundle consisting of helices \u03b114-\u03b120 (Fig. 1b, c).\nThe Lem3 structure reveals similarity to PPM phosphatases A structural comparison of Lem3 using PDBeFold revealed that the closest structural homologue of Lem3 is the deAMPylase domain of the Legionella effector SidD (Fig. 2a, b)28. Other homology results demonstrate that Lem3 adopts a phosphatase fold and is highly similar to PPMs, in particular to the human PPM1A (also referred to as PP2C\u03b1) (PDB ID: 4RA2) (RMSD for Lem321-486 and 4RA2: 2.24 \u00c5 on 187 superimposed C\u03b1-atoms) (Fig. 2b, c)29. Human PPM1A contains a conserved \u03b2-sheet region consisting of 11 \u03b2-strands localised in the centre of the protein. The \u03b2-strands are arranged in two opposing \u03b2-sheets forming a cleft between them (referred to as the core). This arrangement is flanked by several \u03b1-helices. Two manganese ions are located at the base of the \u03b2-sheet cleft and coordinated by six amino acids, i.e. four aspartate side chains (D38PPM1A, D60PPM1A, D239PPM1A, D282PPM1A), the side chain of E37PPM1A, and the backbone carbonyl of G61PPM1A (Supplementary Fig. 1b).\nLem321-486 differs from the conserved PPM1A fold in minor details (Fig. 2b, c): The central \u03b2-sheet core consists of two additional \u03b2-strands (\u03b21 and \u03b219), thereby broadening the cleft. The surrounding \u03b1-helices are more numerous and mostly located at the base and top of the cleft. Altogether, this particular arrangement represents the above-mentioned fist region of Lem321-486. The spatial orientation of the additional \u03b1-helices forming the thumb shape a deep cavity located at the interception of the fist and the thumb (referred to as the hollow region). The base of this hollow region, which is located closely to the \u03b2-sheet cleft in the active centre, harbours the metal ions (Fig. 2d). The position of the metal ions, referred to as M1 and M2, corresponds to the position of the manganese ions in the PPM1A crystal structure (PDB ID: 4RA2). As verified by CheckMyMetal, these metal ions are embedded in an octahedral cluster which is characteristic of the coordination of Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+ ions30. This metal cluster is surrounded by a scaffold of oxygen atoms provided by the side chains of four aspartate residues (D82Lem3, D105Lem3, D254Lem3, andD394Lem3), the backbone carbonyl of a glycine (G106Lem3) as well as six water molecules (Fig. 2b\u2013d, Supplementary Fig. 1b)31. More precisely, M1 is coordinated by D105Lem3, D254Lem3, D394Lem3, and three water molecules. M2 is coordinated by D105Lem3, the main chain-oxygen atom of G106Lem3, and four solvent molecules. One of these water molecules is shared withM1. In addition, D82Lem3 further stabilises onemolecule of water linked to M1 and one connected to M2 via hydrogen bonds.\nIn addition to the \u03b2-strands \u03b21 and \u03b219 that broaden the core \u03b2-sheets, Lem321-486 has six other \u03b2-strands (\u03b22, \u03b25, \u03b212, \u03b213, \u03b216, \u03b217) forming two additional \u03b2-sheets (one \u03b2-sheet consists of \u03b22-\u03b25 and the second of \u03b212-\u03b213 and \u03b216-\u03b217) located in the fist region (Fig. 1b, c, Supplementary Fig. 1a). PPM1A2-368 (PDB ID: 4RA2) and Lem3FL both have C-terminal \u03b1-helical bundles consisting of three (\u03b110-\u03b112) and seven (\u03b114-\u03b120) helices, respectively. The bundles are differently located towards the central \u03b2-sheet core but share some structural similarities (Supplementary Fig. 1c).\nIn summary, the Lem3 crystal structures reveal a conserved PPMlike fold with metal ions at the catalytic centre.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2245 2\nMg2+ and Mn2+ increase Lem3 stability and activity The presence of metal ions in the crystal structure and the structural homology to PPM phosphatases suggests that Lem3 shares a catalytic mechanism with this protein family. Therefore, we investigated the dependence of Lem321-486-mediated dephosphocholination of Rab1bphosphocholine (Rab1bS76(PC)) on divalent cations such as Mg\n2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+.\nFirst, we analysed the influence of different divalent ions on the stability of both Lem321-486 and Lem3FL via thermal unfolding monitored by differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF). The thermal stability of both Lem3 constructs increases by 8, 17 or 11 \u00b0C in presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+, respectively (Fig. 3a). Next, we studied the effect of Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+ on Lem321-486-mediated dephosphocholination of Rab1bS76(PC). Using intactmass spectrometry (MS), time-dependent Rab1bS76(PC) demodification by Lem321-486 was quantified. In the presence of Ca2+, no dephosphocholination was observed. In contrast, Mn2+ orMg2+ promote Rab1bS76(PC) dephosphocholination, with Mn2+ having the strongest effect on activity (Fig. 3b).\nIn order to investigate the relevance of D82Lem3, D105Lem3, D254Lem3 and D394Lem3 for metal binding and dephosphocholination,\nwe compared the catalytic activities of the respective alaninesubstituted Lem321-486-mutants (Fig. 3c). Additionally, the effect of the mutation of D190Lem3 was examined since it is located in close proximity to the metal ions, suggesting that it could be involved in their coordination. Indeed, monitoring of Rab1bS76(PC) dephosphocholination by intact MS demonstrated that alanine substitution of these aspartates substantially decreased the catalytic activity by 75\u201397% relative to the wild-type protein (Fig. 3d). Therefore, metal ion binding is essential for the catalytic mechanism of Rab1bS76(PC) dephosphocholination.\nLem3 can catalyse dephosphorylation and dephosphocholination Lem3 shares a conserved structure with the PPM phosphatase superfamily. We, therefore, analysed its ability to also remove other phosphate-basedmodifications (Fig. 4a). First, we exploited the ability of the Legionella phosphocholine transferase AnkX to catalyse phosphate (P) or phosphoethanolamine (PE) attachment to S76 of Rab1b in vitro32. Preparative modification of Rab1b with phosphate or phosphoethanolamine was performed using AnkX in the presence of the\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2245 3\nco-substrates CDP and CDP-ethanolamine, respectively, and validated using intact MS (Supplementary Fig. 2a).\nDemodification by Lem321-486 was monitored using intact MS (Fig. 4b). Additionally, dephosphorylation was checked by Phos-Tag SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), based on the decreased migration of phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 4c). The catalytic efficiency of Lem321-486 for Rab1bS76(PE) and Rab1bS76(PC) showed no significant difference (Fig. 4b). Full demodification of Rab1bS76(PC) and Rab1bS76(PE) by Lem321-486 was observed after overnight incubation. However, demodification of Rab1bS76(P) takes substantially longer compared to Rab1bS76(PC) and Rab1bS76(PE). Only stoichiometric quantities of Lem321-486 lead to full dephosphorylation of Rab1bS76(P) within 24 hours (monitored by Phos-Tag SDS-PAGE, Fig. 4c). Thus, Lem3 is a poor phosphatase\ndespite the apparently high structural similarity in and around the active centre.\nWe wondered whether other Rab1b PTMs in the vicinity of S76 may affect Lem3-mediated dephosphocholination. Therefore, Rab1b was modified with PC at S76 and AMP at Y77 (Rab1bS76(PC)Y77(AMP)). During Legionella infection, human Rab1b is modified by the Legionella effector DrrA at Y77 with an AMP moiety33. We observed full dephosphocholination of Rab1bS76(PC)Y77(AMP) after overnight incubation with Lem321-486. Despite the close proximity of the sterically demanding AMP-group, the rate of dephosphocholination of Rab1bS76(PC)Y77(AMP) is only moderately impaired compared to Rab1bS76(PC) (Fig. 4b).\nIn addition to Rab1b, also Rab35 can be phosphocholinated in vitro by AnkX.

Furthermore, they are virtually structurally identical, since superimposition of Rab1b and Rab35 results in a RMSD of 0.915 \u00c5 on 164 superimposed C\u03b1-atoms (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Although Rab35 is phosphocholinated at the homologous position, T76 is modified in Rab35 instead of the S76 observed in Rab1b. Interestingly, Lem3 cannot cleave the PCgroup from threonine-containing Rab-variants (i.e. Rab1bS76T(PC) or Rab35T76(PC)), but can dephosphocholinate serine-containing Rabs (i.e. Rab1bS76(PC) or Rab35T76S(PC)): Neither Rab1bS76T(PC) nor Rab35T76(PC) can be dephosphocholinated within 24 h, while Rab1bS76(PC) and Rab35T76S(PC) are demodified at comparable rates by Lem321-486 (Fig. 4d). In conclusion, Lem3 is able to remove different phosphomonoester or phosphodiester linkages of serine but not threonine residues.\nSite-specific cross-linking of Lem3:Rab1b complexes The structure and functional analysis of Lem321-486 provides a rationale for the catalytic mechanism reminiscent of PPM phosphatases. To further characterise the structural basis for Rab1bS76(PC) recognition, we attempted to obtain its complex structure with Lem321-486. Due to the transient nature of their interaction, co-crystallisation of the proteins was unsuccessful. Therefore, we used a site-specific covalently linking strategy to capture the Lem3:Rab1b complex. We applied a previously established procedure that uses a CDP-choline derivative bearing a thiol-reactive chloroacetamide moiety at the quaternary ammonium linked via a C3 linker (referred to as CDP-choline-Cl) (Fig. 5a)20,34 to covalently link theminimal GTPase-domain of Rab1b (aa 3-174) and Lem321-486. First, AnkX was used to quantitatively modify Rab1b with phosphocholine-chloroacetamide (PC-Cl) at S76 (Rab1bS76(PC-Cl)). Next, we incubated Rab1bS76(PC-Cl) with Lem321-486 for covalent complex formation. Lem321-486 contains five endogenous cysteines of which two C209Lem3 and C394Lem3 are located in proximity to the catalytic centre (i.e. the metal ion binding site). In order to reduce spontaneous cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage by Lem3, we additionally introduced the D190ALem3 mutation that substantially decreased hydrolytic activity but did not affect purification yields (Fig. 3d). A covalent Lem321-486, D190A: Rab1bS76(PC-Cl) complex readily formed as indicated by an increase in apparent molecular weight in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5b). The presence of multiple species is likely due to unspecific reaction with the Lem3 cysteine. Successive cysteine substitutions revealed that the construct Lem3D190A_C134S_C209S_C456S formed a single covalent species with Rab1bS76(PC-Cl) linked via Cys395Lem3 (Fig. 5c). Since the mutation D190ALem3 was not sufficient to prevent cleavage of the phosphodiester, we use the S76Tsubstitution in Rab1b (Rab1bS76T(PC-Cl)) for further complex formation. This allowed us to exploit the inability of Lem3 to cleave the phosphate at threonine residues, thereby gaining an hydrolysisdeficient complex. Also, the linkage via Cys395Lem3 may result in suboptimal positioning of Rab1b in the complex interface, as indicated by low overall complex yields. Therefore, we introduced further cysteine substitutions in the putative Lem321-486 active centre in order to improve yields (Fig. 5d). Indeed, the substitution T391CLem3 readily produced preparative quantities of the complex Lem3T391C:Rab1bS76T(PC-C3) and Lem3T391C:Rab35T76(PC-C3) as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE gel shift analysis demonstrated that the purified complex Lem3C134S_C209S_T391C_C395S_C456S:Rab1bS76T(PC-C3) (referred to as complexT391C)was present as a puremonomeric species (Fig. 5f). Intact MS confirmed the complex purity and identity (Fig. 5g). Even though the catalytic activities of the cysteine substitution mutant (Lem3C134S_C209S_C395S_C456S) and the crystallisation construct (Lem3C134S_C209S_T391C_C395S_C456S) are substantially decreased by >99% (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d) compared to wild type, their tertiary structures are identical as outlined below. Thus, the mutations do not affect the overall structure of Lem3 or the arrangement of amino acids within the active site, althoughminor distortionsmay occur that cause reduction of activity. Furthermore, as demonstrated for Lem3 wildtype, the mutants cannot demodify Rab1bS76T(PC) (Supplementary Fig. 4e), permitting us to obtain a stable complex.

The electron density allowed the construction of the protein chains at a high level of details, in particular at the interface where density was observed for the connected amino acids T76Rab1b and C391Lem3 and the PC-C3-group (Fig. 6c). Nevertheless, weak electron density and the high B-factors for the linker atoms indicate structural flexibility (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Therefore, the covalent linker likely does not force Rab1b and Lem3 into artificial conformations (Supplementary Fig. 5b, unbiasedmap). No specific interactions are visible for the C3 linker regionwhile L68Lem3 shows hydrophobic interactionwith the choline group (Fig. 6c, d). Theposition of L68Lem3 is occupiedby an arginine (or the functionally related lysine) inmost PPM phosphatases and by a phenylalanine in SidD (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). The side chain of R33PPM1A is known to be involved in coordination of the substrates phosphate group35 (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Amino acid F74SidD is supposed to interact with the adenine base of the AMP moiety attached to Y77 in AMPylated Rab1b, since F74SidD substitution with alanine strongly affects Rab1b-AMP deAMPylation36.\nSuperimposition of the complexT391C and the Rab1b-unbound Lem3 revealed a secondaminoacidpotentially involved in coordination\nof the choline group.Due to themodificationof T391Lem3 to cysteine for covalent linkage, no interactions can be observed in the complex structure itself, but in silico replacement of C391Lem3 by the natural threonine hints at hydrophobic interaction between the methyl groups of the choline group and T391Lem3. Together, L68Lem3 and T391Lem3 allow the formation of a hydrophobic environment which favours the proper accommodation of the choline group in the catalytic site.\nThe phosphate moiety of the linker in complexT391C does not participate in direct interactions with amino acids, but is involved in the coordination of three metal ions located in the active centre of Lem3 at the same site as observed in the Lem321-486 structure and coordinated by the same residues (D105Lem3, D254Lem3, and D394Lem3, D105Lem3 andG106Lem3) (Fig. 6d). Notably, in the coordination ofM2, a water molecule is substituted by an oxygen atom provided by the phosphodiesters group of the phosphocholine moiety. In addition, a third metal ion (M3) can be placed in the electron density, which is coordinated byD254Lem3 andD190Lem3 (Supplementary Fig. 5e).Water molecules complete the metal coordination at expected positions. Substitution by an alanine of D190Lem3 has a similar deleterious effect of Lem3 catalytic efficiency as the mutation of the aspartate residues coordinatingM1 andM2, suggesting that the presence of ametal ion in position M3 is essential for the proper dephosphocholination by Lem3 (Fig. 3c).\nFig. 4 | Enzymatic analysis of Lem3. a Structures of post-translationally modified aminoacidsofRab1bused for enzymatic analysisof Lem3.bCatalytic efficienciesof Lem321-486 for Rab1bS76(PC), Rab1bS76(PE) and Rab1bS76(PC)Y77(AMP).

However, a new \u03b2-strand is formedby the\u03b112-\u03b113Lem3 loop and a slight lever movement of the four \u03b1-helices constituting the thumb (\u03b19-\u03b113) is observed, leading to broadening of the hollow region (located at the base of the core \u03b2-sheet cleft between fist and thumb). The core structure of Rab1b3-174 in the complex is virtually identical to unbound Rab1b (Fig. 6e). Indeed, Rab1b maintains the typical GTPase fold with \u03b21-\u03b26Rab1b forming a central six-stranded \u03b2-sheet surrounded by five\u03b1helices (\u03b11-\u03b15Rab1b). Only the region encompassing the switch region II (A67Rab1b-G81Rab1b) of Rab1b shows substantial structural rearrangement upon complex formation (Fig. 6e). Rab1b:GDP binds to the hollow region of Lem321-486. The \u03b2-hairpin \u03b212-\u03b213Lem3 of Lem3 protrudes into the Rab1b-region formed by \u03b13Rab1b and switch II.

Tomake room for the\u03b2\u2019\u03b23-4,Rab1b, the cleft between thumbandfist opens up, indicated by a 4 \u00c5 movement of E381Lem3. Additionally, the new \u03b2-strand (\u03b2\u2019\u03b214\u03b215,Lem3) forms in the thumb out of a loop region (I370-Y372Lem3). Together with the already present \u03b2-strands (\u03b212-13Lem3 and \u03b21617Lem3), it forms a new 6-stranded intermolecular \u03b2-sheet (Supplementary Fig. 6b). As a consequence, the switch II region is displaced from the Rab1b core. Also, the phosphocholinated T76Rab1b moves towards the active centre of Lem3, resulting in close proximity of the phosphodiester group to the coordinated metal ion site (Fig. 6a\u2013c, e).\nThe complex interface is characterised by three major hydrophobic patches (referred to as HPI-III) (Fig. 6f). Polar interactions are mainly limited to the \u03b2-strand hydrogen (H-)bonds (Supplementary Fig. 6c, d). Twophenylalanine residues fromLem3 and one fromRab1b form the basis for all three hydrophobic patches. Amino acid F215Lem3 (HPI) is located on top of the \u03b2-hairpin and positions between \u03b13 and switch II of Rab1b by interacting with the hydrophobic core of Rab1b (Fig. 6g), formed by L12Rab1b, I14Rab1b, Y78Rab1b, W102Rab1b, E105Rab1b, I106Rab1b and Y109Rab1b. F215Lem3 occupies the position of Y78Rab1b, which is located in the hydrophobic pocket in theRab1b-apo-structure. As a consequence, Y78Rab1b is displaced by 9.9 \u00c5 (distancebetweenC\u03b1atoms), likely contributing to the movement of switch II towards Lem3\u2019s active centre. This enables the phosphocholinated T76Rab1b to approach the metal ions and thus the active centre in Lem3. HPII is\nFig. 6 | Structureof theLem3:Rab1bcomplexT391C. a,bCartoon representationof the crosslinked complexT391C (PDB ID: 8ALK). The GDP, the linker, T76Rab1b and C391Lem3 are represented as sticks.

The residue interacts with the residues N-terminal of the switch II region (R69-T72Rab1b) of Rab1b.\nHPIII is generated by F70Rab1b. HPII and HPIII overlap with each other as F70Rab1b and F373Lem3 interact via a \u03b2-strand H-bond. F70Rab1b binds into a pocket comprising Y372Lem3, I376Lem3, I378Lem3, P379Lem3 and M382Lem3. The amino acids of Lem3 involved in this pocket are displaced by 2.9-3.9 \u00c5 by F70Rab1b (Fig. 6h). Since Lem3 can also form complexes with Rab35, we investigated whether the key interacting residues ofRab1b are conserved inRab35.Most amino acids are indeed conserved between Rab1 and Rab35, such as F70 (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and amino acids of the hydrophobic core (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e), with the exception of Y109Rab1b, which is N109 in Rab35 (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e).\nTaken together, it appears that the Rab1b switch II region encompassing amino acids F70-Y78Rab1b are held in a specific conformation via F70Rab1b, Y70Rab1b and \u03b2\u2019\u03b214-\u03b215,Rab1b interaction with Lem3.\nDephosphocholination through local substrate remodelling The switch II region undergoes structural remodelling upon complex formation with Lem3. Since the switch II conformation is determined by the nucleotide state of Rab1b, Lem3 may have a preference for the GDP- or GTP-bound form. Hence, the rates of Lem3-mediated dephosphocholination of GppNHp (Guanosine-5\u2019-[(\u03b2,\u03b3)-imido]triphosphate;\na non-hydrolysable GTP-derivative), GTP and GDP bound Rab1bS76(PC) was determined by intact MS. A significant decrease by approximately 30% in Lem3 catalytic efficiency was observed for Rab1bS76(PC) loaded with GTP (0.23 \u00b5M\u22121 s\u22121) or GppNHp (0.24 \u00b5M\u22121 s\u22121) in comparison to GDP (0.74 \u00b5M\u22121 s\u22121) (Fig. 7a). Thus, Rab1bS76(PC) is a preferred Lem3substrate in the GDP-state where the switch II region is supposed to be conformational more flexible rather than in the active, GTP-bound state, in which switch II is conformationally restrained6.\nTo further validate the complex crystal structure, we investigated the impact of selected alanine substitutions in HPI-III using MS-derived dephosphocholination kinetics. Comparison of the catalytic efficiencies of the substitutions F70ARab1b (1%), F215ALem3 (8.2%), F373ALem3 (41%) and F215A_F373ALem3 (0%) in comparison to the WT reveal major contribution of these amino acids for Rab1bS76(PC) dephosphocholination (Fig. 7b, c). While Y372ALem3 (0.12%) of HPIII results in almost no detectable dephosphocholination activity, M382ALem3 (15.3%) strongly and I376ALem3 (38.4%) moderately impair dephosphocholination (Fig. 7b). The catalytic efficiency for R69ARab1b (45.7%) and R71ARab1b (5.3%) (HPII) significantly differs from the one of WT (Fig. 7c). Strong effects on catalytic efficiency of Lem3 were observed forG369ALem3 (18.6%) and I370ALem3 (59%), which arepart of the new \u03b2-strand \u03b2\u2019\u03b214-\u03b215 in Lem3 (Fig. 7b).

We analysed their ability to demodify Rab1bS76(PC), Rab1bS76(PE) and Rab1bS76(P). All mutants, except T391SLem3, show significantly decreased catalytic efficiencies for demodification of Rab1bS76(PC), Rab1bS76(PE) and Rab1b S76(P) (Fig. 7d\u2013f). T391SLem3 only shows significantly reduced rates for Rab1bS76(PC). Mutation of L68Lem3 to alanine or arginine leads to a strong reduction in catalytic efficiency for dephosphocholination (92% or 97%) and demodification of Rab1bS76(PE) (88% or 86%). Dephosphorylation rates of L68ALem3 and L68RLem3 are reduced by (58% or 68%). T391SLem3 shows 28% reduced catalytic efficiency for dephosphocholination, 14% for demodification of Rab1bS76(PE) and 23% for dephosphorylation. T391ALem3 similarly reduces dephosphocholination, dephosphoethanolination and dephosphorylation by 60%, 53% and 30%, respectively. In contrast to themutants tested to validate the protein-protein interaction interface and the substitution T391SLem3, T391ALem3, L68ALem3 and L68RLem3 clearly differ from theWTLem3 in protein stability. L68RLem3 results in a protein which is more thermal stable by 4 \u00b0C while the L68ALem3 mutation reduce the melting temperature of Lem3 by 7 \u00b0C and T391ALem3 by 4 \u00b0C. (Supplementary Fig. 6e).\nIn conclusion, Lem3 preferentially dephosphocholinates GDPbound Rab1bS76(PC). The Rab1b switch II is an essential element in recognition by Lem3. Furthermore, an arginine residue which is important for phosphate binding in PPM-phosphatases is functionally replaced in Lem3by a leucine to bind the triple-methylated quaternary ammonium of the choline group."

Lem3 shows high structural relationship to PPM phosphatases. In addition to SidD, it is the second Legionella effector to reverse a PTM on Rab1b during infection15. Therefore, the evolutionarily conserved PPM-fold may serve as a template for diverse reactions catalysed by this group of proteins. Examples from other pathogenic bacteria using the PPM-fold for effector proteins are from Thermosynechococcus elongates (tPhpA)37, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtPstP)38, Staphylococcus aureus (Stp1)39 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PppA)40.\nOur covalent capture approach using thiol-reactive substrate derivativesmay serve as a basis to analyse other PPM-phosphatase-like proteins, their substrate interaction, and the underlying catalytic mechanisms. Since there is few structural data available for the substrate recognition by PPM phosphatases and none for SidD our findings provide valuable insights into how phosphatases recognise their substrate.\nAlthough catalysing the hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond instead of a phosphomonoester, the typical PPM catalytic centre is highly conserved in Lem3 and hence a similar catalytic mechanism as proposed for PPM phosphatases is likely25. As shown for PPM1A, Lem3 binds two metal ions in its apo-state, while three metal ions are observed in presence of substrate25. Metal ion coordination is performed by a set of highly conserved aspartate residues. Although we crystallised a hydrolysis deficient complex due to the S76Tmutation in Rab1b, the Lem3:Rab1b crystal structure can be used to analyse the active centre since it contains the active Lem3 variant. The Lem3:Rab1b crystal structure indicates a catalytic mechanism involving the three metal ions and two molecule of waters. We speculate that the water molecule in ion-dipole interaction with M1 and M2 performs a nucleophilic in an SN2@P-type attack on the phosphorus atom\n41. M3 may act as a Lewis acid, activating another water molecule to donate a proton for the phosphate/phosphocholine leaving group42 (Supplementary Fig. 5f). The molecular basis for Lem3 performing\ndephosphocholination but struggling with dephosphorylation may partially be explained by the complex structure: L68Lem3 and T391Lem3 are making hydrophobic contacts to the choline group of the linked phosphocholinemoiety (Fig. 6d). In PPMphosphatases, this position is highly conserved and occupied by large positively charged amino acids (R33PPM1A) (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Apparently, the hydrophobic interaction of the choline group with L68Lem3 is important for dephosphocholination sincemutation to alanine and arginine leads to strongly decreased activity compared to the WT (Fig. 7d). However, mutation to arginine does not convert Lem3 into a more efficient phosphatase although the mutation increases to protein stability. Substitution of L68Lem3 with alanine, in contrast, results in a less stable protein, indicating an important functional role. Interestingly, the corresponding amino acid F74SidD in SidD was suggested to be involved in interaction with the AMP moiety of Rab1bY77(AMP)\n36. In addition to L68Lem3, T391Lem3 also contributes to the binding of the choline group. Therefore, we speculate that these positions in PPM like-proteins might contribute to the specificity towards different PTMs.\nUnfortunately, the structure provides no explanation for the preference of Lem3 for serine-PC over threonine-PC. The biological relevance might be the discrimination between two Rab GTPases (Rab1b and Rab35) during the infection, both of them becoming modified by AnkX at serine or threonine, respectively17. Hence, AnkX may phosphocholinate Rab1 and Rab35, but only Rab1 is dephosphocholinated by Lem3.\nIn addition to the catalytic domain, we also provide a structure of the C-terminal part of Lem3, consisting of seven helices forming a bundle. Many PPM like-shaped proteins possess such C-terminal bundles, including SidD. A hydrophobic loop within the C-terminal helical bundle of SidD was shown to be responsible for membranelocalisation at the Golgi apparatus36,43. Since SidD also targets Rab1 during the infection we speculate that the C-terminal part of Lem3 might have a similar function and is responsible for Lem3-localization close to its target protein. However, a corresponding hydrophobic loop could not be identified in Lem3.\nThe crystal structure of the trapped Lem3:Rab1b complex provides insight into the interaction between a PPM phosphatase and its substrate protein. Although thehydrolysis-deficient complex structure cannot represent the active enzymatic state due to the inability of Lem3 to cleave threonine-PC-bonds, our data suggest that the complex structure represents a snapshot of the actual complex binding event of Rab1b by Lem3. So far, there is only one PPM in complex with a cyclic phosphorylated peptide available providing basic information on the orientation in the catalytic centre25. Our structure provides evidence that the individual regions of PPM phosphatases mediate substrate specificity. A structural comparison demonstrates,with one exception, that all analysed PPM phosphatases harbour a structurally conserved positively charged amino acid interactingwith the phosphate group. In Lem3 and SidD, however, the equivalent position is occupied by the leucine or phenylalanine, which are responsible for the binding of the choline and AMP moieties, respectively36. Therefore, we suggest this position to be decisive for the catalytic specificity of the PPM likeshaped enzyme. Also our complex supports the hypothesis of a third metal ion being necessary for hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester25. It also provides a methodical basis to trap and investigate PPM phosphatase substrate-protein complexes using corresponding ATP analogues, resulting in cysteine reactive phosphorylation of substrate proteins.\nAlthough the Lem3-structure was correctly modelled by AF2, a complex structure prediction between Lem3 and Rab1b using AF2 failed. Presumably, the paucity of experimental atomic structures of transient protein complexes impairs the ability of AF2 to overcome those challenges. This argument also applies to the fact that protein complexes of bacterial effectors and host factors are scarce as training\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2245 10\nmaterial for AF2. In addition, even though the core structures of small G-proteins can be reliably modelled, AF2 fails in predicting the various conformational states of the switch regions due to an overrepresentation of the folded, GTP-state in the protein data bank. Thus, AF2 likely is unable to model different conformational states in particular for the complex interface. SinceRab1b\u2019s switch II regionbecomes profoundly restructured upon Lem3-binding, modelling of the interface fails. Consequently, our covalent capture approach is particularly superior to recent modelling approaches when transient complexes and complexes with structural rearrangements in the interface are considered.\nStructure comparisons and functional experiments confirm that a conformational change in switch II, triggered by insertion of a hydrophobic \u03b2-hairpin into the hydrophobic core of Rab1b, is required for dephosphocholination. This finding provides an explanation for Lem3 showing a preference for the inactive, GDP-bound state. In addition, our complex structure explains why dephosphocholination of Rab1b is still possible for Rab1bS76(PC)Y77(AMP). Y77Rab1b is positioned in the hollow region of Lem3, which provides sufficient space for the AMP moiety.\nThere are functional similarities in the action of Lem3 in comparison to AnkX. Like F215Lem3 on the \u03b2-hairpin replaces Y78Rab1b in the core of Rab1b during catalysis, AnkX also uses a hydrophobic thorn-like element to displace the same tyrosine, thereby unfolding and repositioning the switch II region. Furthermore, Lem3 andAnkXhave evolved from the conserved activities of their respective enzyme families into new functions: The FIC-family enzyme AnkX catalyses phosphocholination, even though the FIC-family is mainly involved in protein AMPylation. Similarly, the PPM-family member Lem3 causes dephosphocholination, yet the PPM-family commonly acts as phosphatase. Another functional similarity betweenAnkXandLem3 is thepreference for the GDP-bound state of Rab1b, albeit less pronounced for AnkX20.\nIn summary, covalent capture of the Lem3:Rab1b-complex in combination with structure determination revealed a local unfolding mechanism of Rab1b by Lem3, and provides insight into the target recognition of related PPM-phosphatases. This approach may serve as a template to characterising transient protein complexes in general."

All Lem3 constructs were cloned into a modified pSF vector (Oxford Genetics) with an N-terminal His10- and eGFP (green fluorescent protein)-Tag using SLIC (sequence and ligation independent cloning). Alike all Rab construct were cloned into a pMAL vector (New England Biolabs) with an N-terminal His6- and MBP (maltose-binding protein)-Tag. Tags and POIs (protein of interest) were separated by a TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease cleavage site. Rab1b proteins intended for complex formation were additionally equipped with a His10-Tag and a PreScission protease cleavage site resulting in the following order of tags fromN- to C-Terminus: His6-Tag,MBP-Tag, TEV protease cleavage site, 10x-His-Tag, PreScission protease cleavage site.\nPoint mutations were introduced using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs) as described by the manufacturer.\nProtein expression and purification All Lem3 and AnkX constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells, Rab constructs were expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) cells20. Heat-shock transformation was used to transform the respective plasmid. A preculture in lysogeny broth (LB) medium with at least 10 colonies was grown for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C and 200 rpm (Infors HT shakers). 1 L cultures of LB with a starting OD600 (optical density at 600nm) of 0.04 were grown at 37 \u00b0C and 180 rpm until OD600 0.8. Protein expression was performed at 21 \u00b0C over night\nand induced by adding 0.5mM isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The next day cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000g, 30min). Pellets were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuged for 20min at 3000g and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pellets were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\nFor protein purification pellets were resuspended in Buffer AEffector (50mM HEPES-NaOH pH 8, 500mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 5% Glycerol (v/v), 2mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME)) for Lem3 and AnkX constructs or Buffer ARab (50mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 500mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 10\u03bcM GDP, 2mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol), mixed with a spatula tip of deoxyribonuclease I (DNAse I) (Sigma-Aldrich) and lysed using a French press system (Constant Cell Disruption Systems) at 1.8 kbar. Protein degradation by endogenous proteaseswasprohibited by adding 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation.\nAll chromatography steps during protein purification were performed using NGC medium-pressure liquid chromatography (LC) system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Cleared lysates were supplemented with 25mM imidazole and loaded on a 5ml Nuvia IMAC column (BioRad Laboratories). Proteins were washed using 30mM (Rab proteins) or 40mM (effector proteins) imidazole for 40 column volumes and eluted at 125\u2013150mM imidazole.

Removal of the solubility tags and His-Tagged TEV protease was achieved through either reverse metal chelate affinity chromatography (RMCAC) for effector proteins or RMCAC in combinationwith 5mlMBPTrapHP column (GEHealthcare Life Sciences) for Rab proteins. SEC (size exclusion chromatography) was performed to separate oligomeric species in SEC buffereffector or SEC bufferRab (20mM HEPES-NaOH pH 8, 50mM NaCl, 1mMMgCl2, 5% Glycerol (v/ v), 2mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) or dialysis bufferRab (20mM HEPESNaOH pH 7.5, 50mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 10\u03bcM GDP, 2mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)). Proteins were concentrated to desired concentration using Amicon Ultra 15ml centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore).\nModification and purification of Rab1b and Rab35 Rab1b and Rab35 proteins were post-translationally modified using AnkX1-800 as a transferase. For quantitative PCylation or PEylation of Rab proteins, 1 \u00b5M AnkX was incubated over night with 100 \u00b5M Rab protein and 250 \u00b5M CDP-Choline (Carbosynth) or CDP-ethanolamine (Jena Bioscience) respectively. For Phosphorylation (Pylation) 1 \u00b5M AnkX was incubated with 1 \u00b5M Rab and 100 \u00b5M CDP (Sigma) for 72 h. All modification reactions were performed at 19 \u00b0C in modification buffer [20mM Hepes, 50mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 10 \u00b5M GDP, 1mM TCEP (pH= 7.5)]. Rab modification using cysteine reactive CDPCholine derivative was performed by incubating 1 \u00b5M AnkX, 500 \u00b5M Rab and 750 \u00b5Mderivative. Modification took place for 24 h at 19 \u00b0C in adduct buffer [20mM Hepes, 50mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 10 \u00b5M GDP, 1mM \u03b2-Me (pH = 7.5)]. The CDP-Choline derivative used in this work was previously described in20.\nAMPylation of Rab1b3-174:GDP was performed as previously described in13 with the following changes: AMPylation buffer (20mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 50mM NaCl, 1mM MgCl2, 2mM TCEP) was supplemented with 2.5 x M excess, compared to the Rab1b concentration, of GTP and 10 x M of ATP. DrrA340-533 (GEF-domain) and DrrA16-352 (ATase domain) were added in a 1:100 ratio to promote nucleotide exchange and AMPylation. Samples were incubated at 20 \u00b0C for 4 h. Rab1bY77(AMP) was phosphocholinated as mentioned above.\nModified proteins were separated from AnkX/DrrA, free nucleotide and oligomers using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Cytiva\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2245 11\n75 pg, 16/600). SEC was performed in the SEC bufferRab1b. Proteins were concentrated as described above, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\nAnalytical Lem3:Rab1b complex formation All experiments regarding binary adduct formation and complex formationwereperformed inpresenceof\u03b2-ME as reducing conditions are required for activation of the cysteine preparing it for the reactionwith the chloroacetamide. Other reducing reagents likeDTT andTCEPwere not used due to their, low abundant, reaction with the chloroacetamide group20.\nTo investigate the capability of Lem3 and Lem3Cys to form the specific Lem3:Rab1b complex, equimolar amounts of Lem3 or Lem3Cys and Rab1b, modified with a cysteine reactive phosphocholine derivative, were incubated at 19 \u00b0C for 24 h.\nOptimal conditions for complex formation was analysed in three steps. To analyse temperature dependence of complex formation, equimolar amounts of Lem3 and Rab1 were co-incubated at (19\u00b0, 25\u00b0, 30\u00b0 or 37 \u00b0C) for 24 h. Complex formation over time was analysed using equimolar amounts of Lem3 and Rab1b which were incubated at 19 \u00b0C. Samples were taken after 1min, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The effect of excess of Rab1 or Lem3 on complex yields was analysed by incubating equimolar amounts or 2 or 3 times excess of Rab1 or Lem3 at 19 \u00b0C for 24 h. All analytical complex formation experiments were performed in adduct buffer and complex formation was quantified by SDS-PAGE gel shift assay.\nPreparative Lem3:Rab1b complex formation AnkX was used to quantitatively transfer PC-Cl to 10x-His-taggedRab1b from the cosubstrate CDP-Choline-Cl. Quantitativemodification of Rab1b with the phosphocholine derivative was confirmed using intact MS. After modification with PC-Cl, the SEC-purified binary adduct Rab1bS76(PC-Cl) was co-incubated with equimolar amounts of Lem321-486 over night at 19 \u00b0C. Complex formation was confirmed using SDS-PAGE gel shift assay and 25mM imidazole were added prior to loading on a 5ml Nuvia IMAC column (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The column was washed with 50mM imidazole for 400ml to remove free Lem3. The complex and free Rab1bwere elutedwith 125mM imidazole and dialysed against dialysis bufferRab1b overnight in presence of PreScission protease. SEC was performed to separate the complex from free Rab1b and oligomeric species. The complex was concentrated to desired concentration using Amicon Ultra 15ml centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore)."

M.S.K., A.I. and C.H. envisioned the strategy to obtain the Lem3:Rab1b complex. M.S.K. and V.P. obtained and refined the crystal structure of Lem3FL and the Lem3:Rab1b complex.M.S.K., A.I. andV.P. analysed and interpreted all protein structures. M.S.K. purified the Lem3:Rab1b complex, developed and performed all biochemical experiments presented in this paper, except nanoDSFmeasurements which were performed by V.P. C.H., C.P. and P.O. provided the CDP-Choline-Cl. M.S.K. and V.P. prepared all figures in this paper. M.S.K., V.P. and A.I. wrote the paper. A.I., M.G. and C.H. provided laboratory infrastructure. All authors participated in manuscript editing and final approval."
