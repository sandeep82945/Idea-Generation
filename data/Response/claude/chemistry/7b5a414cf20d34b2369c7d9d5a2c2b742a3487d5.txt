 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Evaluate In-30 at later time points (48h, 72h etc.) to better characterize its pharmacokinetics and tumor retention. The promising results at 24h suggest it could provide even higher tumor contrast at later timepoints.  

2. Modify the linker region of In-30 to reduce kidney retention while maintaining tumor uptake. Strategies could include changing hydrophobicity, charge, or using alternative PSMA-targeting vectors.

3. Evaluate In-30 for PSMA-targeted radionuclide therapy, as its high tumor uptake and retention are desirable properties. Dosimetry and therapy studies could determine its potential. 

4. Develop and evaluate additional dimeric PSMA-targeting agents using alternative designs or linkers to optimize tumor-to-background ratios.

5. Explore pretargeting strategies with In-30 to reduce kidney retention. The click chemistry could allow separate administration of the tumor-targeting and radiolabeled components.
