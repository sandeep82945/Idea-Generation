    "abstractText": "Optical encryption is a promising approach to protecting secret information owing to the advantages of low-power consumption, parallel, high-speed, and multi-dimensional processing capabilities. Nevertheless, conventional strategies generally suffer from bulky system volume, relatively low security level, redundant measurement, and/or requirement of digital decryption algorithms. Here, we propose a general optical security strategy dubbed metaoptics-empowered vector visual cryptography, which fully exploits the abundant degrees of freedom of light as well as the spatial dislocation as key parameters, significantly upgrading the security level. We also demonstrate a decryption meta-camera that can implement the reversal coding procedure for real-time imaging display of hidden information, avoiding redundant measurement anddigital post-processing.Our strategy features themerits of a compact footprint, high security, and rapid decryption, which may open an avenue for optical information security and anti-counterfeiting.",

Nevertheless, conventional strategies generally suffer from bulky system volume, relatively low security level, redundant measurement, and/or requirement of digital decryption algorithms. Here, we propose a general optical security strategy dubbed metaoptics-empowered vector visual cryptography, which fully exploits the abundant degrees of freedom of light as well as the spatial dislocation as key parameters, significantly upgrading the security level. We also demonstrate a decryption meta-camera that can implement the reversal coding procedure for real-time imaging display of hidden information, avoiding redundant measurement anddigital post-processing.Our strategy features themerits of a compact footprint, high security, and rapid decryption, which may open an avenue for optical information security and anti-counterfeiting.\nInformation security is critical for a great number of applications ranging from anti-counterfeiting to telecommunications. Various digital cryptography techniques have been investigated to prevent information leakage, pursuing a high-security level of information. For computer-based techniques, long latency and high computational power are two main challenges. Compared with their electronic counterparts, optical cryptography techniques generally have the advantages of low-power consumption, high-speed parallel processing, and multi-dimensional capabilities, opening up a gate for securing information1,2. The past decades have seen significant advances in optical cryptography, includingopticalwatermarking3, steganography4, and visual cryptography (VC)5,6. Nevertheless, the early efforts rely on the complex combination of multiple optical components for signal processing in the Fourier realm7, leading to a large form factor. Furthermore, owing to the limited vector optical-field manipulation capabilities of conventional optical devices, the abundant degrees of freedom of light, such as amplitude, phase, frequency, polarization, etc., have not been fully exploited in early optical cryptography, leading to a limited safety performance8\u201311. In recent years, metasurfaces, one kind of ultrathin optical elements consisting of an array of subwavelength nanostructures, have been developed to manipulate all the fundamental properties of light12\u201324. By combining multiple meta-atoms25\u201327 or different phase shift mechanisms28\u201332, a single metasurface can be engineered to achieve independentmulti-dimensional optical-fieldmanipulation33\u201335. The compactness and versatile functionalities make metasurfaces perfect candidates for optical encryption36\u201342, through various mechanisms such as multichannel vector hologram by exploiting Malus\u2019s law43\u201345, the combination of grayscale/color printing and the holographic image46\u201350, as well as tunable meta-holograms based on phase-change materials or spatial light modulators51\u201354.

The vast majority of holographic cryptography techniques can be potentially cracked by adjusting the polarization state of the input and output light or the incidence wavelength38,41,44,46. A pioneering work that combinesmetasurface with ghost imaging or singlepixel imaging provides a framework to solve the integration problem and enhance the security level55. In recent investigations, the security level has been improved by integrating metasurface imaging, visual cryptography, and computational imaging56,57. Generally, owing to the indirect imaging manner of computational imaging, multiple optical measurements or additional digital post-processing are required for hidden image restoration. Essentially, these approaches deviate from the original intention of all-optical encryption, leading to the loss of the merits of parallel, high-speed, and low-power consumption properties to some extent.\nHere, we propose the concept of high-security vector VC, whose ciphertexts are coded based on the vector imaging process of a spindecoupled dual-axis metalens. Since the spatial degree is theoretically unlimited and the encryption is combined with other degrees (e.g., incident wavelength, polarization, orbital angular momentum, and spatial dislocation of spin states), our approach enables much higher security. Benefiting from the metasurface-based vector optical manipulation58, the complex encryption process can be reversely decrypted via a compact meta-camera. Once these optical key parameters are all matched perfectly, the hidden vector optical information is converted into detectable intensity patterns, enabling secure decryption in real-time without additional measurement and digital post-processing. Owing to the advantages of a compact footprint, high-security level, and real-time security display (see Supplementary Note 1 for a comprehensive comparison among different optical cryptography techniques), the proposed vector VC is favorable for\noptical information security and anti-counterfeiting. These properties are of significance in the future development of optical security1,59,60, especially in monitored/peeped environments5,61."

            "text": "Concept and operation principle of the decryption camera Most conventional VC devices decompose secret images intomultiple binary amplitude or phase shares, which are then digitally or physically overlapped to recover the original secret image. Compared with existing intensity- and phase-only scalar VC, our proposed vector VC exhibits a higher security level since it fully exploits abundant degrees of freedom of light as key parameters, including wavelength, phase, amplitude, polarization, and spatial dislocation. Therefore, the hidden image in a ciphertext cannot be directly decrypted by simply rotating the polarization state of the input and output light54, ensuring a highsecurity level. To decrypt the optical ciphertext images, we construct a user-defined meta-camera based on the vector imaging principle, which could realize real-time decryption without complex mathematical operations or additional computational hardware resources. As indicated in Fig. 1, the decryption meta-camera contains two unique decryption elements: a) spin-decoupled dual-axis metalens generating pixel-wise spatial dislocation and overlap between two spin replicas of a ciphertext image and b) a vector sensor comprising a vector polarization analyzer attached to a photodetector for rapid security display.\nSpecifically, the spin-decoupledmetalens equivalently operates as two independent devices with full-aperture utilization, owing to the conjugate symmetry breaking of photonic spin-orbit interactions via combining both propagation and geometric phases in a single metasurface25,28. Here, the spin-decoupled metalens is designed as a dual-axis planar lens to respectively respond to the left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized (LCP and RCP) light coming from the\n|LCP> |RCP>\nx\ny\nx\ny\nx\ny\n+ x\ny\n+\nMetalens Phase\nVector sensor\nCiphertext\nLinear\npolarizati on\nSpatial dislocation and vector coherent systhesis\nHidden image\nVector polarizer\nx\ny\nLCP RCP\nTwo spin replicas\nFig. 1 | Schematics of a meta-optics-empowered decryption camera for vector VC. The decryption camera is composed of spin-decoupled dual-axismetalens (the phase profile is schematically shown in the top panel) and a vector polarizationanalyzer sensor (indicated in the inset). The spin-decoupled dual-axis metalens divides the coded phase-type ciphertexts into two replicas with opposite circular polarized states and projects them to the image plane with spatial dislocation and\noverlap (bottom panel). The handedness and phase at each pixel are represented by the direction of the circle arrows and the azimuthal angle of short wires, respectively. As a reversal process of the coding procedure, the vector optical field synthesized at the spatially overlapping region on the image plane reproduces the hidden image in the optical ciphertexts with the help of a matched vector polarization analyzer.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1946 2\noptical ciphertext. Consequently, the single-to-singlepointmappingof a conventional lens is transformed into dual-to-single or single-to-dual mapping. As shown in the bottom of Fig. 1, when an optical ciphertext is placed at a proper distance from the spin-decoupled metalens, it divides the optical ciphertext into two replicas with opposite spin states and projects them to the image plane with a certain spatial dislocation and overlap. The optical ciphertext exhibits a spatially inhomogeneous phase, resulting in the inherent phase difference between twopoints of the ciphertext. In addition, therewill be a spatial variation between the propagation phases accumulated along distinct optical paths,when twoseparatedpixelson the ciphertext respectively pass through the dual-axis centers of themetalens and intersect at one point on the image plane. Furthermore, the linear polarization direction of incidence will introduce a uniform phase difference between the two spin replicas. Owing to the inhomogeneous distribution (phase, amplitude, or both) of two spin replicas caused by the aforementioned factors, a complex vector optical field is generated in their overlapping region at the image plane. For ease of understanding, Fig. 1 shows a case of the phase-type ciphertext. Since conventional cameras cannot directly characterize the distribution of vector light fields, another vital decryption element called vector sensor is constructed by tightly attaching a vector polarization analyzer to a normal photodetector. The vector polarization analyzer is composed of metagratings with spatially varying orientations. It converts the synthesized vector optical field into intensity patterns, wherein the intensity value is determined by both the aforementioned phase difference and the orientations of meta-gratings.\nThe imagingmechanismofourdecryption camera is equivalent to the reversal process of the coding procedure. As shown in Fig. 2a, under the illumination of linearly polarized light (composed of two\nspin states represented by \u03c3 = \u00b11), any pixel (denoted as Q) located at the overlapping region on the image plane is the vector coherent synthesis of RCP and LCP components coming from two separated points (denoted as Q+1 and Q\u22121) on the object plane via the spindecoupled dual-axis metalens. The design of the spin-decoupled metalens is shown inSupplementaryNote 2.Without loss of generality, we assume that the camera operates with a distortion-free magnification factor of d2/d1, where d1 and d2 are the object and image distances, respectively. If the pixel size of the ciphertext is sufficiently larger than the detection resolution, the image canbe approximated to a point-topoint projection from (u, v) to (x, y) (the diffraction effect along the optical path is ignored). Under a circularly polarized basis, the output electric fields distribution can be approximately written as:\nE\u00f0x,y\u00de / X \u03c3 ei\u00f0kQ\u03c3Q \u03c3\u03b8\u00deU\u00f0u,v\u00de 1 \u03c3i = X \u03c3 ei\u00f0kQ\u03c3Q \u03c3\u03b8\u00deU d1x d2 \u03c3Su 2 , d1y d2 \u03c3Sv 2\n1\n\u03c3i\n,\n\u00f01\u00de\nand\nk = 2\u03c0 \u03bb ,Su =\u0394x d1 d2 + 1 ,Sv =\u0394y d1 d2 + 1 , \u00f02\u00de\nwhere kQ\u03c3Q represents the propagation phase along the optical path, (\u0394x, \u0394y) is the lateral displacement between the two axes at the metalens plane, (Su, Sv) is the lateral displacement between points Q+1 and Q\u22121, and \u03bb indicates the wavelength.

There are three phase factors in the right-hand of Eq. (1) contributing to the phase differences between two spin replicas, which respectively depend on the different propagation phase, the azimuthal angle of the incident polarization, and the inherent phase of the ciphertext.\nWhen the size of the ciphertext is much smaller than the focal length, the paraxial approximation holds and E(x,y) can be approximately simplified with the spin-independent phase being ignored:\nE\u00f0x,y\u00de\u2248 X \u03c3 ei\u00bd\u03c3\u03c7\u00f0x,y\u00de \u03c3\u03b8 U d1x d2 \u03c3Su 2 , d1y d2 \u03c3Sv 2\n1\n\u03c3i\n, \u00f03\u00de\nwhere \u03c7 indicates the halved propagation phase difference between two distinct optical paths and can be written as:\n\u03c7\u00f0x,y\u00de= k xSu + ySv 2d2 = k\u00f0x \u0394x + y \u0394y\u00de\u00f0d1 +d2\u00de 2d2 2 : \u00f04\u00de\nSince the complex-amplitude of the ciphertext and the opticalpath-determined propagation phase difference are changed among the spatial pixels, the final polarization distribution is inhomogeneous and complex, as illustrated in Supplementary Note 3. Since the polarization states of the two spin replicas areorthogonal, therewill be no interference-induced intensity change after synthesis. To address this issue, a vector linear polarization analyzer with a spatially varying orientation of \u03b3(x, y) is required at the front of sensors to form the complex interference effect between the two dislocated replicas and then convert the phase difference and amplitude into detectable intensity patterns, which can be written as:\nI\u00f0x,y\u00de= X \u03c3 ei\u03c3\u00bd\u03c7\u00f0x,y\u00de \u03b8 \u03b3\u00f0x,y\u00de U d1x d2 \u03c3Su 2 , d1y d2 \u03c3Sv 2 2 : \u00f05\u00de\nIn principle, the more complex the orientation distribution of \u03b3, the higher the security. For simplicity, we utilize a catenary-like vector polarization analyzer with its spatial orientation \u03b3\u00f0x,y\u00de= \u03c7\u00f0x,y\u00de \u03b8+\u03c0=2, as discussed in Supplementary Note 4. Since its orientation profile linearly changes with the coordinates, its structural streamline, illustrated as the blue dash curve in Fig. 1, forms the catenary of equal strength14. Under this condition, the final intensity pattern through the vector polarization analyzer is obtained:\nI\u00f0x,y\u00de= X \u03c3 \u03c3U d1x d2 \u03c3Su 2 , d1y d2 \u03c3Sv 2 2 : \u00f06\u00de\nAs illustrated by Eq. (4\u20136), the imaging result of our decryption meta-camera is the interference result between different spatial pixels in the ciphertext, accompanied by a phase difference of \u03c0. The final intensity distribution is determined by several critical key parameters (\u03bb, \u0394x, \u0394y, d1, d2, \u03b8, and \u03b3). The abundance of key parameters ensures a high-security level of the complex-amplitude vector VC. Therefore, it is unlikely to decrypt the vector VC by try-and-error attack within a reasonable time if these key parameters are unknown.\nSubsequently, we show how to encrypt an arbitrary hidden intensity image I into the ciphertext U. Without loss of generality and for simplicity, it is assumed that \u0394y=0, I has a pixel number of q1 \u00d7 q2 with a pixel size of \u0394x \u00d7\u0394x, and Su =n\u0394x, where n is a positive integer. To realize dislocation encryption between different columns, U requires at leastq1 \u00d7 \u00f0q2 +n\u00de pixels for complete image restoration. The firstn columns ofU are randomcomplex numbers, therefore, the same hidden image I can be encrypted into many different ciphertexts. An\nexample of the same information hidden in multiple different ciphertexts is presented in Supplementary Note 5.\nIn general, the lth row and mth column of U is given by:\nU\u00f0l,m\u00de= U\u00f0l,m n\u00de\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi I\u00f0l,m n\u00de p ei\u03c81\nor\nU\u00f0l,m n\u00de+ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi I\u00f0l,m n\u00de p ei\u03c81\n8>< >:\n, m>n\u2265 1 \u00f07\u00de\nwhere the one with the smaller modulus is selected. For m \u2264 n, there are:\nU\u00f0l,m\u00de=aei\u03c82 \u00f08\u00de\nHere,\u03c81 and\u03c82 are randomphases ranging from0 to 2\u03c0 and a is a random number ranging from 0 to 1. In our design, \u03c81 is equal to zero for simplicity. These random codes in the ciphertexts (the first n columns of U) and hidden image (its phase profile) can reduce the probability that directly inferring the hidden image I from the complex amplitude of the ciphertext.\nExperimental demonstration and security verification of the vector VC In the decryption meta-camera, the phase coefficients and profiles of the spin-decoupledmetalens for RCP andLCPcomponents are given in Supplementary Note 2. The distinct phase profiles of LCP and RCP are implemented by merging the propagation phase (\u03b2) and geometric phase (\u22122\u03c3\u03b1) in a singlemetasurface, which is composed of high-index dielectric rectangular nanopillars with various geometries and orientations (\u03b1). Among them, the propagation phase is spin-insensitive and utilized to generate the focusing wavefront, while the spin-dependent geometric phase introduces an opposite linear phase gradient to the focusing wavefront, leading to the generation of the dual-axis metalens. These phases can be independently controlled by the spatial geometries and orientations of the nanopillar. Under the normal illumination of circularly polarized light of \u00bd1, \u03c3i T, the output field from the nanopillars follows an analytical model based on the Jones matrix given by (see Supplementary Note 2 for details)28,31:\nEatom = cos \u03b4 2 ei\u03b2 1 \u03c3i + i sin \u03b4 2 ei\u00f0 2\u03c3\u03b1 +\u03b2\u00de 1 \u03c3i , \u00f09\u00de\nwhere \u03b2 + \u03b4/2 and \u03b2-\u03b4/2, respectively, denote the phase shifts along the two main axes of the nanopillar and \u03b1 is its orientation angle. The first term in Eq. (9) is determined by the propagation phase and shares the same polarization with the incidence. In contrast, the second term reverses the handedness of the incidence and imparts not only the geometric phase but also the propagation phase. These phases can be independently controlled by the spatial orientation and geometries of the nanopillars, which are required in constructing the spin-decoupled metalens25,28. Note that the phase difference of \u03b4 between two anisotropic axes generally equals to \u03c0 for high energy efficiency.\nFor proof-of-concept demonstrations, the vector VC is demonstrated at the wavelength of 10.6\u03bcm.We utilized all-silicon nanopillars with high transmissivity at this wavelength as meta-atoms, which are arranged in a square lattice with the period and height being kept (px = py = 4.8 \u00b5m and h = 7.3 \u00b5m), as indicated in Fig. 2b. The amplitude andphase of the spin-reversed light as functions ofwidthW and length L are determined through the finite-element method and the simulation results are presented in Fig. 2c. As indicated by the black points in Fig. 2c, a set of eight nanopillars with properW and L (the geometries are listed in Supplementary Table 3), including eight basic structures are utilized to provide eight phase levels covering the 2\u03c0 phase range with high average polarization conversion amplitude (higher than0.8). Then, the geometries and spatial orientation of themeta-atomsat each pixel can be determined by the required phase profiles for RCP and\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1946 4\nLCP (\u03b6 + 1 and \u03b6 1) 25,28. The designed metalens are fabricated by direct laser writing (seeMethods for details), and the SEM image is presented in Fig. 2d, demonstrating high fabrication quality. Note that, our vector VC can be extended to the near-infrared and the visible band. The direct laser writing can be replaced by electron-beam lithography for smaller feature fabrication. The spin-decoupled metalens and corresponding meta-atoms operating at the communication band of 1.55\u03bcm are presented in Supplementary Note 2.\nFigure 3a shows our experimental setup. A proper incident linear polarization is critical to illuminate the steganographic ciphertext (S1), which serves as the first key in the decryption process. S2 and S3 represent the spin-decoupled metalens and vector polarization analyzer, respectively. The imaging system parameters are summarized as follows: d1 = d2 = 130mm (the focal length is 65mm), \u0394x = 100\u03bcm, \u0394y = 0, \u03b8 = 0, and Su = 2\u0394x (i.e., n in Eq. (7) is equal to 2). The simulation results shown in Supplementary Note 4 indicate our vector polarizer supports a high extinction ratio of ~1000:1 and transmissivity of ~85%, which can be further improvedbydecreasing the period and structural\nheight. To demonstrate the robustness of our system, three kinds of optical ciphertexts with binary pure-amplitude (Fig. 3b), binary purephase (Fig. 3c), and grayscale complex-amplitude (Fig. 3d) encryption are fabricated and characterized. Multiple meta-atom interference approach proposed in our previous work25 is employed to generate such an optical ciphertext with arbitrary complex-amplitude distributions U (see Supplementary Note 6 for details), which can be directly decrypted by the proposed decryption meta-camera with proper design and a set of matched key parameters. The SEM images, complex-amplitude distributions of these optical ciphertexts, and simulated andmeasured imaging results are shown in the left, middle, and right panels of Fig. 3b\u2013d. Themeasured results are consistent with simulation results, which indicates the encrypted information can be effectively retrieved by our system due to its capability to detect and analyze vector optical fields. Supplementary Movie 1 shows a rapid decryption process.\nAs discussed above, the optical decryption requires a specially equippedmeta-camera with proper designs and key parameters: i.e., a\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1946 5\nspin-decoupled dual-axis metalens with matched key parameters (Su and Sv determined by \u0394x, \u0394y, d1, and d2), a vector polarization analyzer with a matched spatial orientation \u03b3 = \u03c7 \u03b8+\u03c0=2, and a correct incident polarization state (linear polarization with an azimuthal angle of \u03b8). Missing any of these secret keys will result in a failed decryption. The following simulations are carried out for security verification of the vector VC under different physical parameters. Figure 4a displays schematic diagrams of optical setups for characterizing the sensitivity of image fidelity to the incident and detection polarization directions, which are controlled by rotating two normal linear polarizers P1 and P2, respectively. The vector polarization analyzer (S3) is utilized in the left panel case but is replaced by the linear polarizer (P2) in the right panel case. The image fidelity is defined as 1 P \u2223I Io\u2223= P \u2223I + Io\u2223 to measure the similarity between the retrieved image and hidden image, where I and Io, respectively represent the normalized intensity of the measured pattern and hidden pattern. Figure 4b\u2013d shows the two-dimensional map of image fidelity as a function of the horizontal dislocation of Su and incident polarization angle of \u03b81, detection polarization angle of \u03b82, and vertical dislocation of Sv. It can be seen that confidential information can only be retrieved with relatively high image fidelity in a small area, where the key parameters exactly approach the designed systemparameters. Note that, the actual selectable parameter space is larger than the simulation range. For example, dislocation parameters of Su and Sv can go well beyond \u00b1400\u03bcm, and both incident and detection polarizations can be at any point on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere (e.g., security verifications under circularly polarized incidences are presented in Supplementary Note 7). Figure 4e shows the simulated imaging results of a hidden QR code at different key parameters, represented by circles of different colors in Fig. 4b~d.We can see the hiddenQR code can be reconstructed precisely at the center of the hot spots. To retrieve the hidden image, a matched vector polarization analyzer is necessary but insufficient. Especially when the vector polarization analyzer (S3) is replaced by a normal linear-polarization analyzer (P2) in the camera, the image fidelity is always low. In other words, confidential information cannot be obtained, no matter what the incidence polarization is. If other parameters have been known by the attacker and the hidden imaging is relatively simple, normal polarization filters jointly with physics-driven machine-learning modeling could extract relevant information through multiple measurements. However, this potential attack canbe readily reducedbyusing a hybrid vector polarization analyzer during the encoding of ciphertexts. For example, the catenary-like vector linearpolarizationanalyzer couldbe replaced by a full-Poincar\u00e9 vector polarization analyzer based on the local interference principle25,27."

Furthermore, the high-security level of the meta-optics-based vector VC is examined, which simultaneously requires a proper incidence polarization, a correct imaging configuration, and a matched vector polarization analyzer. Inspired by the spatial vector coding empowered by spin-decoupledmetasurfaces62,63, we expect the meta-optics-based camera to obtain all-optical sensingcomputing capability in the near future, which combines the sensing and computing in a single meta-device without any electronic postprocessing. The capabilities of parallel high-speed processing and multi-dimensional manipulation may open an avenue for vector optical field research as well as intelligent perception and recognition.\nThe proposed vector VC has good scalability to further enhance its security without the sacrifice of responding time and convenience. For example, the incident polarization state can be coded to apply to a special elliptical polarization or even a vector field. The cryptography complexity can also be increased by using hybrid vector depolarizers or extending the dual-axis metalens to multi-axis metalenses (e.g., each circular polarization corresponds to multiple focus points enabled by complex-amplitude superposition64) for complicated spatial dislocation among multiple replicas. Furthermore, owing to the advantage of rapid decryption, one can design meta-ciphertexts containing volatile materials to maintain the correct complex amplitude in a given condition, while the device can be destroyed under unauthorized try-and-error attack. In addition, combined with the recent advance in spatial nonlinear optics10, one can develop a nonlinear vector VC encryption system to reduce the risks caused by the fixed linear relationship between the ciphertext and hidden image, including known-plaintext attack, chosenplaintext attack, and deep-learning-based attack."

An inductively coupled plasma etching combined with the Bosch process was subsequently employed to transfer photoresist patterns into the silicon wafer to form silicon structures. For the vector polarization analyzer, a doublesided polished barium fluoride wafer was deposited with a 600-nm gold layer using magnetron sputtering.
