The roots, possessing dammarane-type triterpenoid (DTT) as dominant chemical components with various bioactivities, such as immunostimulatory, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-hypertensive, antitumor, and CNS-protective activities, are used widely as major ingredients in many traditional Chinese medicinal preparation for treating cardiovascular diseases in the world.1 Moreover, some minor constituents are also identied from PN. For example, dencichine, a PN amino acid, plays a main hemostatic role by improving the amount and activation of platelet and inhibiting brinolysis.2 Polyacetylenes, found in PN and Korean ginseng, displayed cytotoxic, anti-platelet, and antimicrobial activities.3\nPlant Resources in West China, Kunming\nnces, Kunming 650201, PR China.

Further bioassayguided isolation yielded nine new nontriterpenoids, including two novel alkaloids (1, 2), ve a,b-unsaturated furanones or pyranones (3\u20137), and two polyacetylenic alcohols (8, 9) (Fig. 1).\nThe alkaloids (1, 2) contained a unique N-methylacetamido substituent on their unreported 1-oxotetrahydropyrimidine skeleton, representing the rst rare non-amino acid alkaloid from ginseng plants. New lactones (3\u20137) were biogenetically considered to be transformed from panaxatriol (PXT), a polyacetylene naturally occurring in the genus Panax, through their intermediate products (8, 9) by a series of reactions. Herein, the structural elucidation of nine new nontriterpenoids (1\u20139), the plausible bio-transformed pathway for lactones, as well as their antiproliferative activity against ve human cancer cell lines, were deduced in detail.

The 1H, 13C NMR and HSQC spectra suggested the presence of para-substituted benzene [dC 147.0, 126.8, 130.5 (2C), 124.2 (2C), dH 7.98 and 7.33 (each 2H, d, J = 8.7 Hz)], and the remaining nine carbon resonances assignable to three conjugated ketones (dC 171.6, 166.8, 155.0), one methine (dC 46.1), two methylenes (dC 50.0, 42.6), two singlet methyls (dC 32.6, 22.6) and one methoxyl (dC 52.3), as well as broad and short active hydrogen (dH 5.63) (Table 1).

The HMBC (Fig. 2A) correlations from H3-9 (dH 2.10), H3-10 (dH 3.03), and H-4 to C-8 (dC 171.6), H3-9 to C-10 (dC 32.6), H3-10 to C-4 (dC 46.1), revealed an Nmethyl acetylamino group located at C-4. Likewise, the HMBC correlations of H-3'/5' (dH 7.98), H-2 \u2032/6\u2032 (dH 7.33), and H3-8 \u2032 (dH 3.87) to C-7\u2032 (dC 166.8), and H3-8 \u2032 to C-4\u2032 (dC 126.8) indicated the existence of a methoxyl acyl group at C-4\u2032. In addition, the very\n11038 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 11037\u201311043\nhigh eld of the carbonyl group (dC 155.0) showed a correlation with H2-3/H2-5 in the HMBC spectrum, and the HMBC correlation between H2-3 and C-1\n\u2032, suggested an (N-methyl acetylamino)-oxytetra-hydropyrimidine ring was attached to C1\u2032 (dC 147.0) of para-substituted benzene through a tertiary nitrogen atom. Finally, the structure and absolute conguration of 1 were unequivocally conrmed as (R)-2-(p-benzoate methyl)4-(N-methylacetami-do)-1-oxotetrahydropyrimidin by X-ray single crystal diffraction [Flack parameter = 0.03 (4)] (Fig. 2B).\nCompound 2 was isolated as white amorphous powder, with a molecular formula of C15H19N3O5, as deduced by HREIMS (m/ z 321.1328 [M]+), which was one more oxygen atom than that of 1.

The additional oxygen was assigned to a hydroxyl group at C-3\u2032 (dC 160.0) because of H-2\u2032 presenting as a smaller doublet signal (dH 7.70, d, 2.7 Hz) with HMBC correlation to C-1\u2032 (Fig. 2A). On account of the only chiral carbon at C-4 in 2, the consistent positive optical ration with 1, indicated the same 4R-conguration for 2 to 1. Thus, 2 was determined as (R)-2-(3-hydroxy-4methoxyl acyl)phenyl-4-(N-methylacetamido)-1oxotetrahydropyrimidin.\nCompound 3 was obtained as a yellow oil, possessing a molecular formula C12H18O4, as determined by the HRESIMS (m/z 271.1186 [M + HCOO]\u2212). The 13C NMR spectrum showed 12 carbon resonances, assignable to ve methylenes with a vinyl (dC 113.9), four methines with two oxygen bearings (dC 83.0, 72.0), two quaternary carbons, and one methoxyl. The 1H NMR spectrum presented a methoxy at dH 3.65 (3H, s), two oxymethines at dH 5.04 (overlap) and 4.02 (d, 3.1 Hz), two olenic protons at dH 6.58 (d, 1.7 Hz) and 5.83 (ddt, 16.9, 10.2, 6.7 Hz), and two terminal olenic protons at dH 5.04 and 4.99 (dd, 10.1, 0.8 Hz) (Table 2). Analysis of the 1H\u20131H COSY correlations (Fig. 2A) revealed a chain fragment of \u2013CH\u2013CH(O)\u2013 CH(O)\u2013(CH2)4\u2013CH]CH2. In the HMBC spectrum of 3, correlations of olenic proton H-4 (dH 6.58) with C-3 (dC 148.7)/C-5 (dC 83.0), oxymethines H-5 (dH 5.04) with C-2 (dC 168.4)/C-3/C-4 (dC 116.0)/C-6 (dC 72.0) and H-6 (dH 4.02) with C-4/C-5/C-7 (dC 34.2)/ C-8 (dC 26.2), and the methoxyl protons (dH 3.65) with C-3 were observed respectively.

The ECD spectrum showed a negative Cotton effect at 210 nm for a lactonemoiety, indicating the S conguration of C5.6 Furthermore, the small coupling constant of 3JH5\u2013H6 (3.0 Hz) indicated the gauche conformation for H-5 and H-6, while the two small bond heteronuclear coupling constants (2JH6\u2013C5 = 2.8 Hz, 2JH5\u2013C6 = 2.3 Hz) in the HETLOC spectrum (Fig. S29\u2020), suggested the relative congurations of H-5 and H-6 were threo and determined 5S,6R congurations of 3.7 Subsequent ECD calculations were conducted to further identify the absolute conguration of 3, which showed that the calculated ECD spectrum of (5S,6R)-3 was in good agreement with the experimental ECD curve of 3 (Fig. 2B). Consequently, compound 3was determined as (5S,6R)-5-(1-hydroxy-2-pentenyl)-3-methoxy2(5H)-furanone.\nCompound 4 was isolated as a colorless oil and was assigned the molecular formula C12H20O4 with three degrees of unsaturation by the HRESIMS (m/z 273.1345 [M + Na]+). Detailed comparison of NMR data between 4 and 3 indicated their structures to be quite similar, except that the terminal ethyl group (dC 139.7, 115.2) in 3 was replaced by one methylene (dC 23.4) and one methyl group (dC 14.8) in 4, as indicated by the HMBC correlations from H2-11 (dH 1.25) to C-10 (dC 32.6)/C-12 (dC 14.8) and the\n1H\u20131H COSY correlations of H3-12 (dH 0.85)/ H2-11/H2-10 (dH 1.77, 1.50)/H-9 (dH 1.33).

The detailed analysis of 1H and 13C NMR, DEPT, and HSQC spectra showed varied different chemical shis with those of 3 on the two oxymethines as well as the a,b-unsaturated ketone carbons. The HMBC correlations from oxymethines H-6 (dH 4.53) to C-2 (dC 161.0)/C-4 (dC 114.9)/C-5 (dC 66.5)/C-7 (dC 32.7)/C-8 (dC 25.5) and H-5 (dH 4.63) to C-3 (dC 145.2)/C-4/C-6 (dC 84.7), as well as the 1H\u20131H COSY correlations of H-4/H-5/H-6/H2-7 (dH 2.00, 1.77)/ H2-8 (dH 1.60, 1.43)/H2-9 (dH 1.32)/H2-10 (dH 1.96)/H-11 (dH 5.78)/ H2-12 (dH 5.03, 4.97), revealed a six-membered d-lactone in 5 replacing the g-lactone moiety in 3. According to the small coupling constant of 3JH5\u2013H6 (3.2 Hz), and a reliable ECD empirical rule for structure with a,b-unsaturated-d-lactone moiety,8 6R Conguration was assigned as the ECD spectrum of 5 (Fig. S53\u2020) showing a positive Cotton effect at 262 nm. Thus, compound 5 was elucidated as (5R,6R)-6-(1-hydroxy-5-hexenyl)5-hydroxy-3-methoxy-2(5H)-pyranone.\nCompound 6 was obtained as a yellow amorphous powder with the same molecular formula C12H20O4 as that of 4, suggested by a molecular ion peak at m/z 273.1345 [M + HCOO]\u2212. The NMR data (Table 2) characterized an identical a,b-unsaturated-d-lactone moiety (dC 161.1, 145.2, 114.9, 84.8, 66.6) with 5. The slight difference between them was that the terminal alkenyl (dC 139.5, 115.3) chain in 5 was reduced to an aliphatic chain at C-6, as the 1H\u20131H COSY spectrum showing the long coherent signals of H-3/H-4/H-5/H2-6/H2-7/H2-8/H2-9/H2-10/H311 in 6. Moreover, the consistency between the ECD spectra of compounds 6 and 5 and the small JH4/H5 (3.3 Hz), indicated that 6 shared the same 5R and 6R congurations with that 5. Thus, the structure of 6 was determined to be (5R,6R)-6-(1-hydroxyhextyl)-5-hydroxy-3-methoxy-2(5H)-pyranone.\nCompound 7 was isolated as a colorless oil and its molecular formula C11H18O3 was deduced from HRESIMS (m/z 221.1149 [M + Na]+). The 13C NMR and DEPT spectra showed 11 carbons, which were similar to those of 6, except for a set of up and downshied double bond signals (dC 90.3, 173.0 for 7; dC 145.2, 114.9 for 6) and a missing oxymethine in 7. The 1H\u20131H COSY correlations of H2-5/H-6/H2-7/H2-8/H2-9/H2-10/H3-11 and HMBC correlations of H-6 with C-2/C-4/C-5/C-7/C-8, H2-5 with C-3/C-4/ C-6/C-7, H-3 with C-2/C-4/C-6, and methoxyl protons (dH 3.66) with C-4, established the plane structure of 7. Moreover, the optical rotation of 7 ([a] \u221297.4) was consistent with a synthesized analogue (R)-6-hexyl-4-methoxy-6-hydroxy-2H-pyran-2-one ([a] \u2212103.5, >99% ee)9 and opposite to the corresponding isomer ([a] +80.1, 83% ee) with the identical skeletal structure to 7 but surplus S-isomer,10 indicating R-conguration for 7. Therefore, compound 7 was identied (R)-6-(1-hydroxyhextyl)-4methoxy-2(5H)-pyranone.\nCompounds 8 and 9 were isolated as both colorless oil and had molecular formulas of C18H28O7 and C18H30O7, respectively. Their 1D NMR and HSQC spectra showed great similarities, except that an alkenyl in 8 was replaced by an aliphatic methyl in 9 (Table S1\u2020). The 1H\u20131H COSY spectrum displayed clear \u2013CH2(O)\u2013CH(O)\u2013CH(O)\u2013 (8 and 9)\u2013 and \u2013(CH2)4\u2013CH]CH2 (8) or \u2013(CH2)5\u2013CH3 (9) correlations, and the HMBC correlations\n11040 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 11037\u201311043\nof H-8 with C-7/C-6/C-5/C-4/OCH3, H-9 with C-7, H-3 with C-4/C5/C-6/C-7, H-2 with C-4, and methoxy proton (dH 3.46) with C-8, indicating the partial structure of C-1 to C-9 connected by the conjugate diacetylene and a methoxy group located at C-8 in both 8 and 9. Six broad active protons (OH) peaks in the downeld showed direct 1H\u20131H COSY correlations with H-1 to H-3, and H-9 to H-11, respectively, evidenced further the existence and location of six hydroxyls. Thus, the planar structures of 8 and 9 were identied, as shown in Fig. 1.

Under the high degree of oxidization in the infected plant, the olenic bond, C-8, C-11, and terminal fatty chain of natural PXT were selectively oxidized to intermediate products (8, 9). Their second alkynyl (C-6, C-7) was then oxidatively cracked into the carboxyl group, which was further esteried with one of the hydroxyl groups randomly to form a ve- or six-member lactone ring. Finally, the hydroxyl group next to methoxy was eliminated with ortho hydrogen to form a double bond. The absolute conguration of C-10 on PXT and lactones were kept unchanged during the transformation. In turn, the identication of 6R-conguration on compounds 3\u2013 6 proved the outstanding stereoselectivity of the oxidization reaction by bio-catalysis. To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have reported that PXT can be transformed into new metabolites by fungi.13 New lactones and their precursors discovered in this work suggested that polyacetylene in PN could also be transformed under a highly oxidized environment, and the endophyte in the rot PN roots could be a potential tool to convert PXT and ginsenosides, which was worth further investigation.\nIn vitro cytotoxic activity\nAll the isolates were evaluated for cytotoxicity on ve human cancer cell lines (myeloid leukemia HL-60, lung cancer A-549, colon cancer SW480, breast cancer MCF-7, and hepatocellular\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

As shown in Fig. 3A and Table S5,\u2020 two alkaloids (1, 2) displayed a promising inhibitory activity against all ve cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 14\u201324 mM, which were comparable with that of positive control cisplatin (DDP, purchased from Selleck, USA). However, all the a,b-unsaturated lactones (3\u20137) showed no signicant cytotoxicity on tested cancer cells with inhibition ratios < 50% at a concentration of 40 mM (Table S4\u2020). This is different from the previous research on their precursor structure (PXT).3a,b The results of the in vitro bioassay suggested that endophytes in the infected PN roots may hold a detoxication mechanism, which can convert toxic metabolites into less toxic compounds to make themself survive in the rhizosphere environment.\nIn silico target prediction and molecular docking analysis\nIn silico studies nowadays play an important role in small molecule target prediction and help novel structures to nd bioactive potential.14 To explore the possible target protein and obtain deeper insights into the intermolecular recognition mode, target prediction, and molecular docking simulation were performed.\nOf all the top 15 possible targets predicted by SwissADME for 1 and 2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), directly or indirectly related to the world's most common and deadly cancers, was investigated for molecular docking study. EGFR belongs to a family of four related receptor tyrosine kinases,\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nwhich act as key mediators in cell signaling pathways involving cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastatic spread.15 As depicted in Fig. 3B, 1, 2, and the EGFR inhibitor, afatinib, were docked exactly on the ATP binding pocket of wild human EGFR tyrosine kinase (PDB: 6VHN). The EGFR/1 complex revealed a good least binding energy of \u22126.6 kcalmol\u22121, higher than that of the positive control, afatinib (\u22127.3 kcal mol\u22121). The binding prole of 1 showed that C-1, C-8 carbonyl groups interacted with MET 793 (3.1 \u00c5) and LEU 718 (3.4 \u00c5), 6-NH interacted with MET 793 (2.4 \u00c5), 8\u2032-O atom interacted with THR 854 (2.9 \u00c5), C-7\u2032 carbonyl group interacted with LYS 745 (3.5 \u00c5), and GLU 762 (4.2 \u00c5) (the same residues binding with co-crystallized ligand). Compound 2 displayed almost the same binding mode of 1 on the receptor site with a binding energy of \u22126.5 kcal mol\u22121 through several hydrogen bonds between C1]O andMET 793 (3.1 \u00c5), C8]O and LEU 718 (3.7 \u00c5), 6-NH and Met 793 (2.4 \u00c5), 8\u2032-O and THR 854 (3.1 \u00c5), C7\u2032 = O and LYS 745 (3.4 \u00c5), GLU 762 (3.9 \u00c5). The adoptedmolecular docking method was veried by redocking the co-crystallized ligand with small RMSD = 0.68 \u00c5 and a binding energy score of \u22127.6 kcalmol\u22121. In addition, physicochemical parameters for both Lipinski's and Veber's rules and pharmacokinetic properties (gastrointestinal absorption and blood\u2013brain barrier) were determined for 1, 2, and afatinib proceeding by SwissADME.16 As shown in Table S7,\u2020 1 and 2 obeyed the rule of ve (RO5) criteria without any violations from Lipinski's Rule and passed through the Veber rule by topological polar surface area (TPSA) lower than 140 \u00c52.

The new compounds 1 and 2 exhibited not only anti-proliferative activity but also promising oral bioavailability pharmacokinetic properties as the positive control, afatinib.\nEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition activity\nEGFR overexpression is observed in cancers of the head and neck, ovary, cervix, bladder, oesophagus, stomach, brain, breast, endometrium, colon, and lung.17 The activation and autophosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the receptors lead to several downstream signaling pathways, therewith eliciting the cascade of multiple events in the cytoplasm, as well as cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis.18 International guidelines recommended EGFR inhibitors as the priority treatment for advanced EGFR mutation patients, regarding the higher efficacy and safety rather than standard chemotherapy.19 Due to the results of in vitro cytotoxicity and in silico simulation, the inhibition of 1 and 2 on EGFR tyrosine kinase was investigated using a commercial radio-labeled kit (Promega, China), with afatinib (Selleck, USA) as the positive control. Compounds 1 and 2 displayed a general inhibition effect on wild-type EGFR tyrosine kinase with IC50 values at 28.58\u00b1 1.37 and 29.13\u00b1 0.96 mM (Fig. 3C and Table S6\u2020). It gave acceptable consequences coordinated with the cytotoxic and molecular docking results, and suggested that the cytotoxicity of alkaloids 1 and 2 was mediated by the inhibition on EGFR signaling. Natural alkaloids isolated from rot PN roots will provide a new scaffold candidate for developing and structural modication of novel EGFR-inhibitor."

            "text": "Further bioassay-guided phytochemical investigation of rot PN roots led to the identication of nine new non-triterpenoids including two alkaloids, and ve lactones along with two biotransformed intermediates. Structurally, this study come to a consistent conclusion with our previous work that the oxidation degree was increased in the microbial-infected PN roots5a from the point of Ginseng polyalkynol. Moreover, compounds 1 and 2 revealed a noteworthy inhibition on ve human cancer cell lines. The mechanism of anti-cancer action was explored by target prediction and molecular docking study, which simulated the recognition and interaction of the compounds with amino acid residues of EGFR tyrosine kinase mainly through hydrogen bonds inside the active site of the pocket. Finally, the EGFR inhibition experiment with a moderate inhibition effect veried that the EGFR signaling regulation pathway is probably involved in the anti-cancer cell lines of the active compounds. This work provided a natural candidate for probing and structural modication of novel type EGFR-inhibitor and new anticancer agent. Furthermore, the discovery of non-triterpenoid compounds enriched the chemical diversity of PN and reminded us that rot PN roots can be used as a special resource for bioactive components instead of being wasted or thrown away.\n11042 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 11037\u201311043"
