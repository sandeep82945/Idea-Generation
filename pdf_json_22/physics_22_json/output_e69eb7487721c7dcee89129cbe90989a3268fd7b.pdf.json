            "text": "Ho2Ir3Si5 belongs to the family of three-dimensional (3D) R2Ir3Si5 (R = Lu, Er and Ho) compounds that exhibit a colossal first-order charge density wave (CDW) transition where there is a strong orthorhombic-to-triclinic distortion of the lattice accompanied by superlattice reflections. The analysis by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) has revealed that the Ir-Ir zigzag chains along c are responsible for the CDW in all three compounds. The replacement of the rare earth element from non-magnetic Lu to magnetic Er or Ho lowers TCDW , where TCDWLu = 200 K, TCDWEr = 150 K and TCDWHo = 90 K. Out of the three compounds, Ho2Ir3Si5 is the only system where second-order superlattice reflections could be observed, indicative of an anharmonic shape of the modulation wave. The CDW transition is observed as anomalies in the temperature dependencies of the specific heat, electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility, which includes a large hysteresis of 90 to 130 K for all measured properties, thus corroborating the SXRD measurements. Similar to previously reported Er2Ir3Si5, there appears to be a coupling between CDW and magnetism such that the Ho3+ magnetic moments are influenced by the CDW transition, even in the paramagnetic state. Moreover, earlier investigations on polycrystalline material revealed antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at TN = 5.1 K, whereas AFM order is suppressed and only the CDW is present in our highly ordered single-crystal. First-principles calculations predict Ho2Ir3Si5 to be a metal with coexisting electron and hole pockets at the Fermi level. The Ho and Ir atoms have spherically symmetric metallic-type charge density distributions that are prone to CDW distortion. Phonon calculations affirm that the Ir atoms are primarily responsible for the CDW distortion, which is in agreement with the experiment."

Originally, the manifestation of a CDW was proposed to originate in Fermi surface nesting (FSN), as it is present in quasi-one-dimensional metals (1D).1 More recently, alternative mechanisms were proposed that explain, for example, the formation of CDWs by q-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in three-dimensional (3D) CDW compounds. Examples of 3D metals with CDWs include \u03b1-Uranium,2 CuV2S4,3\u20136 La3Co4Sn13,7\u20139 RTe3 (R = La, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm),10\u201312 RTe2 (R = La, Ce),13,14 R5Ir4Si10 (R = Dy, Ho, Er, Yb, Lu),15 Sm2Ru3Ge5,16 EuAl4 17\u201321 and CuIr2\u2212xCrxTe4.22 In several of these compounds a coexistence and competition exists between the CDW and antiferromagnetic (AFM) order or superconductivity (SC). In the family of compounds RNiC2 (R = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm),23\u201329 the CDW competes with AFM. In the case of SmNiC2 ferromagnetic (FM) order completely destroys the CDW.24,25 On the other hand, Kolincio et al.29 have established the coexistence of a CDW and field-induced FM order in TmNiC2, suggesting strong coupling of the rareearth spins to the CDW in these rare-earth materials. However, the magnetic susceptibility of the paramagnetic regime does not exhibit anomalies at the CDW transitions.\nEr2Ir3Si5 differs from most magnetic CDW compounds, in that the magnetic susceptibility of the paramagnetic state exhibits an anomaly at the CDW transition.30 Presently, we report a similar effect for Ho2Ir3Si5. On the other hand, the CDW of non-magnetic Lu2Ir3Si5 coexists with SC at low temperatures.31\nInvestigations of the CDW in Lu2Ir3Si5 has been extensively done.32\u201335 Studies by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reported the modulation wave vector as q = \u03c3(1\u030421) with \u03c3 = 0.23\u20130.25 around 200 K.35 Recently, the modulated crystal structure of Lu2Ir3Si5 was reported as similar to that of Er2Ir3Si5.36 In both systems it was elucidated that the CDW resides on the zigzag chains of Ir atoms along c. Although the rare earth element is not directly involved in the stabilization of the CDW, we have earlier proposed that it would\nindirectly influence the CDW through its size (atomic radius). Er has a larger atomic radius than to Lu has (2.26 vs 2.17 \u00c5),37 while the transition occurs 50 K lower in Er2Ir3Si5 than in Lu2Ir3Si5. Here, we find that there is no such simple relationship between atomic radius and TCDW . The atomic radii of Ho and Er are equal, but TCDW = 90 K of Ho2Ir3Si5 is much lower than TCDW = 150 K of Er2Ir3Si5.\nFrom SXRD we found that Ho2Ir3Si5 undergoes a large distortion of the lattice where the symmetry is lowered from orthorhombic (Ibam) to triclinic (I 1\u0304) below the transition temperature TCDW . Simultaneously, superlattice reflections appear at incommensurate positions, with values of q = [0.2494(2), 0.4978(2), 0.2488(2)] at 70 K. The CDW is supported by zigzag chains of Ir atoms in all three compounds R2Ir3Si5. Ho2Ir3Si5 differs from Lu2Ir3Si5 and Er2Ir3Si5 by the presence of second-order superlattice reflections in its SXRD, indicative of anharmonic contributions to the displacive modulation wave.\nWe present for Ho2Ir3Si5 the temperature dependencies of the electrical resistivity \u03c1(T ), the specific heat Cp(T ) and the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7(T ). They show anomalies in agreement with a first-order CDW transition with a hysteresis of about 40 K. Due to the strain imposed by the transition onto the crystal, it cracks which can be seen clearly from the resistivity measurements. Such cracking of crystals has also been observed in other CDW compounds, like BaFe2Al9.38 From the magnetic susceptibility we observed that there is an influence of the CDW on the effective magnetic moment of Ho3+, which is similar to what was reported in Er2Ir3Si5.30 Such an effect of the CDW on the rare earth spin in the paramagnetic state is not commonly seen in rare earth compounds. Earlier studies have shown that the disorder in the polycrystalline material allows long-range AFM order to develop at low temperatures.32,33 However, in the present high-quality single crystal, longrange AFM order is absent and only the CDW is observed. Here, we elucidate the differences and similarities in the incommensurate structure of Ho2Ir3Si5 by comparing with Lu2Ir3Si5 and Er2Ir3Si5. Furthermore, we explore the coupling of the CDW and magnetism of Ho3+ spins and absence of long-range AFM order."

We have chosen the Czochralski over flux growth or any other technique because the individual elements have high melting points. Furthermore, iridium metal does not dissolve in most of the typical fluxes. To start with, high purity individual elements of Ho : Ir : Si (99.99% for Ho and Ir, and 99.999% for Si) were taken in the stoichiometric ratio 2 : 3 : 5, amounting to about 8 to 9 g, and melted repeatedly to ensure its homogeneity. Next, a seed crystal was cut from this polycrystalline ingot for the purpose of crystal growth. The polycrystalline seed was gently inserted into the molten solution and initially pulled at a rapid speed of about 80 mm/h. The temperature of the\nmelt was adjusted such that a necking is formed and then we employed a pulling speed of about 10 mm/h throughout the growth process. About 50 mm long ingot was pulled. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to verify the chemical composition.\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD): data collection and data\nprocessing.\nSmall pieces of single-crystalline Ho2Ir3Si5 were obtained by crushing a large single crystal, from which crystal A of dimensions 0.15\u00d70.07\u00d70.1 mm3 was selected for a single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) experiment at beamline P24 of PETRA-III Extension at DESY in Hamburg, Germany.

SADABS42 was used for scaling and absorption correction, with Laue symmetry mmm for the data in the periodic phase and 1\u0304 for the CDW phase. As the crystal structure in the CDW phase is incommensurately modulated we had to use the superspace approach39,43,44 to index and integrate the data.

            "text": "Unlike Er2Ir3Si5,30 the manifestation of the CDW appears to be sluggish in Ho2Ir3Si5. The crystal was initially cooled from room temperature down to 70 K, where it remained in the orthorhombic phase, despite TCDW being about 90 K according to the physical property measurements.\nIt is possible that the crystal was cooled too rapidly, thereby not allowing it to settle in the CDW phase, and resulting in an undercooled state. Upon further lowering of the tem-\nperature to 20 K, we observed the coexistence of orthorhombic and CDW phases, indicative of a first-order transition (Figs. 2 and 3). The CDW phase is characterized by superlattice reflections at positions q = [0.2496(3), 0.4987(3), 0.2493(3)], accompanied by a large monoclinic distortion of the lattice (\u03b2 = 91.784(3) deg), similar to R2Ir3Si5 (R = Lu, Er) (details are given in the Supporting Information40).\nThe severity of the distortions induces a colossal strain in the crystal, causing the diffraction spots in SXRD to become broad and elongated [Figs. 2(b) and 2(c)], resulting in many partially overlapped reflections which cannot be used for structural analysis. Sometimes the strain is too much for the crystal to handle, such that it physically shatters, rendering it unusable for further investigations. Such destructive behaviour of the CDW has also been reported for BaFe2Al9.38\nAnother important difference to Lu2Ir3Si5 and Er2Ir3Si5 is that we observe in SXRD on Ho2Ir3Si5 second-order superlattice reflections (m = 2) in addition to first-order superlattice reflections (m = 1) [Figs. 2(e) and 2(f)]. The orthorhombic phase disappears after the crystal is heated to 50 K, and only the CDW phase remains at temperatures 50\u2013130 K (Figs. 2(c) and 3). Further heating to 150 and 200 K causes the crystal to enter the orthorhombic phase and the CDW phase disappears [Fig. 2(a)]. Similar to Lu2Ir3Si5 and Er2Ir3Si5, there is a lowering of the point symmetry from orthorhombic to triclinic which causes the crystal to be twinned with four orientations.52\nFigure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the lattice parameters. One can observe the clear distortion of the lattice upon entering the CDW state, including an expansion of b and contractions of a and c. Furthermore, the change in lattice type at TCDW appears discontinuous, in agreement with the first-order character of the phase transition. Barring 20 K and 130 K as 20 K is an undercooled mixed state and 130 K is on the onset of TCDW warming and therefore unreliable, it can be inferred from Fig. 3(d) that the modulation wave vector q decreases with temperature.\nThe presence of second-order satellite reflections required refinement of the crystal struc-\nture with higher order harmonics for the modulation functions. Table 2 provides a comparison of the models to see which provides the best fit to the SXRD data in the CDW phase."

At first glance from Table 2 we see a huge improvement of the fit to the second-order satellites upon introduction of third-order harmonics. However, all these parameters have a s.u. that is larger than the refined value itself. The latter indicate that the system would have third-order satellite reflections with intensities larger than its first- and second-order satellites.

Figure 4 shows the crystal structure projected onto the a-c plane at 200 K and 70 K (average structure at 70 K).

The lattice distortion results in alternating short and long Ir1a\u2013Ir1b distances, where the shorter distance is the most affected by the modulation. The formation of dimers on the Ir1a-Ir1b zigzag chains along c is responsible for the formation of the CDW.\nTable 3 provides a comparison of essential structural parameters between the three compounds R2Ir3Si5. Our earlier proposal, that TCDW would be inversely proportional to the atomic radius of the rare earth element, is not confirmed by Ho2Ir3Si5. The atomic radius\nof Ho is comparable to that of Er, however TCDW of Ho2Ir3Si5 is much lower than that of Er2Ir3Si5.

It is metallic such that both electron and hole pockets exist at the Fermi level. To resolve the contributions of electronic states near the Fermi energy, we show the atomic orbital projected density of states (PDOS) in Fig. 6(c). The Ir states are dominant near EF , whereas the Ho and Si states have lower weight than those of Ir atoms. To understand the charge density distributions of these atoms, we have shown the charge density on two different planes in the primitive unit cell, which contain Ho and Ir atoms, respectively [Figs. 6(d) and 6(e)]. The spherical charge distribution of these atoms is reminiscent of the metallic type ionic environment and suggests that these atoms are more likely to undergo CDW modulations to find a low energy state.53\nFigure 6(f) shows the phonon spectrum along various high-symmetry directions in the BZ. The system is dynamically unstable with Kohn-type54 soft modes at Z, R and in be-\ntween Y and U points. The phonon PDOS [Fig. 6(g)] shows that Ho and Ir atoms contribute to the low-frequency phonon modes, whereas high-frequency phonon modes are dominated by Si atoms. The imaginary frequencies are inherent to the Ir atoms, confirming that the CDW is associated mainly with the Ir atoms. The lowest value of negative frequency is found near the reciprocal point (0.25, 0.50, 0.25), which is consistent with the incommensurate wave vector q found in the SXRD experiment. Figure 6(h) demonstrates the evolution of the soft phonon mode as a function of the smearing parameter \u03c3, which represents the electronic temperature in our calculations. The soft phonon mode disappears upon increasing the smearing parameter \u03c3 from 0.05 eV to 0.5 eV. This particular dependence of the phonon frequencies on the smearing parameter (electronic temperature) indicates that the orthorhombic structure is stable only at higher temperatures as seen in our experiments."

            "text": "From Fig. 7 we infer that, upon cooling the crystal, there is a sharp upward turn of the electrical resistivity at 90 K, which signifies the opening of a gap in the electronic density of states over a major fraction of the Fermi surface, in agreement with the formation of a charge density wave (CDW) at this temperature. The metallic nature of the crystal after the CDW\ntransition indicates a partial opening of the gap at the Fermi surface. Upon heating, \u03c1(T ) shows a sharp anomaly at 130 K, thereby establishing a huge hysteresis of 90\u2013130 K. This large hysteresis and the sharpness of the transition signify that it is a first-order transition much like the one seen in R2Ir3Si5 (R = Lu, Er).30,31 Such a large hysteresis is uncommon for CDW transitions. Especially for incommensurate CDWs the transition usually is of second order, e.g. as found in the canonical CDW system NbSe3.55\nAll measurements were made using virgin samples. After cooling and then heating through the phase transition, micro-cracks develop due to the strain induced by the transition. This feature is visible in the electrical resistivity through a lower resistivity of virgin samples than of samples that have gone through a cooling/heating cycle (Fig. 7). Similar behavior has been observed for ceramic material of R2Ir3Si5 (R = Lu, Er).32,33 It was explained by variations of pinning of the CDW in those systems. However, it is possible that the large lattice distortions accompanying the CDW transition could be responsible for the formation of micro-cracks. This leads to a reduction of sizes of mosaic blocks, and an increase in texture, which, in turn, would cause an increase of the electrical resistance at each thermal cycle. The presence of micro-cracks is supported by the observation that the transition temperatures and hysteresis are the same in each thermal cycle. On the other hand, the increase of pinning centers would lead to a lowering of the CDW transition temperature, which is not observed here. Just as in the case of R2Ir3Si5 (R = Lu, Er),30,36 we observe that the electrical resistivity exhibits a T 2 dependence below T = 50 K, which is up to much higher temperatures than \u223c10 K for a Fermi liquid, implying dominant contributions from short-range magnetic fluctuations of Ho spins in the absence of long-range magnetic ordering."

Measurements\nwere performed with a commercial superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS 7, Quantum Design, USA) employing a magnetic field of 0.1 T along c, during cooling and heating between 2 and 300 K (Fig. 8). The most interesting feature\nof the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility is the noticeable increase of \u03c7(T) at 90(1) K upon cooling through the CDW transition. The observed effect cannot be explained by a change of Pauli susceptibility at the transition, since the estimated magnitude of the Pauli susceptibility is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed change in the susceptibility. Furthermore, one would expect a smaller Pauli susceptibility in the CDW phase, whereas we observe an increase of the susceptibility when cooling through the transition. The same transition is found at 130(1) K upon heating. The observed hysteresis is in good agreement with the hysteresis in the electrical resistivity and DSC measurements. A Curie-Weiss fit to the data at 140\u2013300 K results in a Curie constant of C = 31.78(1) emu/mol K and an antiferromagnetic Weiss temperature of \u03b8 = -2.6(1) K. A Curie-Weiss fit to the low-temperature paramagnetic regime 40\u201390 K results in C = 32.4(1) emu/mol K and \u03b8 = -6.3(1) K. The different Curie constants correspond to different effective magnetic moments on Ho3+ of 11.27 \u00b5B and 11.38 \u00b5B, respectively. These values are slightly higher than the free ion magnetic moment of Ho3+ ions.\nSo we see that Ho2Ir3Si5 joins our earlier studied Er2Ir3Si5 30 as yet another exceptional case in showing an effect of the CDW transition on the magnetic susceptibility. Usually, compounds containing magnetic rare-earth elements do not show any anomaly in the paramagnetic susceptibility at the high-temperature CDW transitions. This is true for many of the magnetic CDW compounds which are mentioned in the introduction. For example, the paramagnetic susceptibility of Ho5Ir4Si10 does not show any anomalies at its CDW transition.56,57 The coexistence of antiferromagnetic order (TN = 2 K) and CDW in Ho5Ir4Si10 might be related to the presence of weakly coupled 4f electrons of Ho3+ ions,15 while for Ho2Ir3Si5 the reduced magnitude of the magnetic moments and strong coupling suggest influence of the 4f electrons in the CDW transition and vice versa. It is not clear, whether the small but distinct change of Ho3+ moment (11.27 \u00b5B vs 11.38 \u00b5B) across the CDW transition in a single crystal of Ho2Ir3Si5 could be responsible for the absence of magnetic ordering of Ho3+ moments in the crystal down to 2 K."

We are unable to find a peak in Cp(T ) while cooling the crystal. Similar behavior was noted earlier for a crystal of Lu2Ir3Si5.31 This feature could be the result of the specific method of measurement employed in the PPMS instrument. In a second experiment, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was measured from 80 to 150 K on the same single crystal of Ho2Ir3Si5 (Fig. 10). The DSC data show clear peaks at different temperatures in the heating and cooling runs, that appear at similar temperatures as are found for the electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility, and thus confirm the first-order character of the phase transition. The peaks appear of similar width as for Lu2Ir3Si5,31 while the DSC peaks are much sharper for Er2Ir3Si5.30 Since other features, like Cp(T ) and \u03c1(T ), exhibit very sharp anomalies at the CDW transition, the broadened features in the DSC signal might be related to the rate of change of temperature in this experiment in conjunction with the sluggish character of the transition.\nThe lattice contribution to the specific heat was determined from a fit to the data far away from the transition.

            "text": "We have established an incommensurately modulated crystal structure of the CDW phase of Ho2Ir3Si5. The incommensurate modulation is accompanied by a strong lattice distortion, both of which are important for the modulation of interatomic distances on zigzag chains of iridium atoms along c. This is in accordance with the CDW being supported by these zigzag chains. Similar to the case of Er2Ir3Si5, the rare earth atoms are not directly involved in the CDW formation. The occurrence of a large lattice distortion accounts for the sluggish character and large hysteresis of the transition, as they are apparent in the temperature dependencies of the electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Another unique feature of the compounds R2Ir3Si5 (R = Lu, Er and Ho) is the extreme sensitivity of the phase transitions to crystalline order. The present single crystals of high perfection undergo a CDW transition, while magnetic order is suppressed down to at least 1.5 K. It is worthwhile to point out that the previous experiments on polycrystalline material did not observe the CDW transition, while magnetic order appeared below TN = 5.1 K.32,33 The present results on Ho2Ir3Si5 do not confirm the idea that TCDW would scale with the atomic radius of the rare earth element. While the size of Ho is equal to that of Er, TCDW is much lower for Ho2Ir3Si5 than for Er2Ir3Si5. This absence of a correlation in the series R2Ir3Si5\nis in contrast to the series of isostructural rare-earth compounds R5Ir4Si10,15 where TCDW increases with increasing size of the rare earth element R.\nThe SXRD data have revealed that the structure of Ho2Ir3Si5 is different from that of Lu2Ir3Si5 and Er2Ir3Si5. Although the symmetries are the same for all three compounds, the presence of second-order superlattice reflections in the CDW phase of Ho2Ir3Si5 has added more complexity to it, requiring modulation functions with up to second-order harmonics (model A in Section ).\nFrom physical property measurements, a huge hysteresis is found of about 40 K, with the transition proceeding at 90 K (cooling) and 130 K (warming). The transition implies severe structural distortions, such that sometimes the crystal shatters. This is visible in the electrical resistivity, which is higher after cycling though the transition than before (Fig. 7). The effective magnetic moment of Ho is found to change at the CDW transition, from 11.38 \u00b5B to 11.27 \u00b5B (Fig. 8). This kind of coupling between CDW and magnetism is rare. It has only been observed in isostructural Er2Ir3Si5. This feature can probably be attributed to the participation of 4f orbitals of Ho or Er in states near the Fermi level that are involved in CDW ordering. The fact the effective moment of the rare earth is influenced by the CDW transition suggests a competition between CDW and magnetic order, with both interactions presumedly employing the same part of the Fermi surface. In order to clearly understand the mechanism for this unusual nature one would probably need microscopic probes of magnetism, such as elastic and inelastic neutron scattering."
