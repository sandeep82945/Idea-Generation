Even so, when students self-regulate their learning, they typically block their study by choosing to stay within the same category on subsequent trials. Our goal was to evaluate the degree to which such decisions to stay within a category are influenced by performance on the previous practice trial. In five experiments, participants learned to classify categories of rocks by completing practice classification trials, receiving feedback, and making decisions about what to study on the next practice trial. The rate of stay choices was influenced by feedback type, a preceding familiarity trial, and location in the list. Most importantly, stay rates were low following correct classification demonstrating a preference to interleave study. By contrast, stay rates substantially increased following incorrect classification. Thus, practice classification performance and subsequent study decisions during complex categorical learning tasks can be strongly related.",

            "text": "Learning to correctly classify exemplars into their categories is essential for success both in and out of the classroom. Categorical learning can be influenced by how exemplars are ordered \u2013 blocked or interleaved \u2013 during study. Even so, many people prefer to block their study (i.e., study exemplars from the same category grouped together) even in contexts in which interleaved study (i.e., study exemplars from different categories so they are intermixed) is superior for learning. Our aim was to investigate the possibility that students\u2019 study order choices are systematically influenced by performance during learning, a hypothesis for categorical learning that is consistent with theoretical frameworks on self-regulated learning.\nAccording to the discriminative contrast hypothesis, making comparisons between exemplars is critical for category learning (Carvalho & Goldstone, 2014). One way to encourage comparisons between exemplars is to manipulate study order. Interleaving involves studying exemplars in an\nintermixed order so that an exemplar is followed by an exemplar from a new category. To interleave during learning, after completing a practice trial, students choose to study an exemplar from a different category \u2013 that is, they make a between-category switch. By contrast, blocking involves studying exemplars in a grouped order so that an exemplar is followed by other to-be-learned exemplars in that same category. To block during learning, after completing a practice trial, students choose to revisit the same category (stay within the category). Relative to blocking, interleaving can benefit classification performance (Brunmair & Richter, 2019; Firth et\u00a0al., 2021), which may be attributable to between-category comparisons (Carvalho & Goldston, 2014; Kang & Pashler, 2012), improved processing during learning (e.g., Kornell & Finn, 2016; Rohrer et\u00a0al., 2014), and better attention (Metcalfe & Xu, 2016). However, important moderators for the interleaving effect have also been identified (Brunmair & Richter, 2019; Firth et\u00a0al., 2021).\nGiven that study order can directly impact category learning, it is critical to investigate the order in which students choose to study categories. Students\u2019 study choices during self-regulated learning are important because much of students\u2019 learning occurs outside of the classroom and with minimal guidance. If students make poor study decisions, their learning can suffer, whereas wise study choices will * Addison L. Babineau a.babineau@tcu.edu\n1 Department of\u00a0Psychology, Texas Christian University, Fort\u00a0Worth, TX\u00a076129, USA\n1 3\ncontribute to superior learning. Thus, it is imperative to understand how students order items during study and to identify variables that impact students\u2019 study order choices when learning complex categories.\nA growing area of research investigates students\u2019 study choices during category learning tasks (e.g., Morehead et\u00a0al., 2017; Wahlheim & DeSoto, 2017). Students adopt a blocking strategy in many category learning tasks. Tauber et\u00a0al. (2013) found that participants blocked 70\u201397% of study trials. Students\u2019 preference to block is robust; however, blocking rates are not always so high (e.g., Kornell & Vaughn, 2018), and participants can reduce blocking rates when learning categories with consistent features (Lu et\u00a0al., 2020). Even so, blocking rates are congruent with students\u2019 selfreported beliefs about study order choices. Most students believe that blocking is more beneficial for their learning relative to interleaving (Kornell & Bjork, 2008; McCabe, 2011; Morehead et\u00a0al., 2016), and it can be challenging to create a context in which students are willing to interleave their study (Yan et\u00a0al., 2016). Further, even when students do report a preference for interleaving, they typically prefer it in combination with blocking to create a hybrid schedule (Yan et\u00a0al., 2017).\nTo better understand how students make study decisions during category learning, we turn to contemporary theory in self-regulated learning (for reviews, see Bjork et\u00a0al., 2013; Kornell & Finn, 2016). According to the agenda-based regulation model of learning, students create and act on agendas to achieve their learning goals (Dunlosky et\u00a0al., 2011). They use agendas as a basis for their choices, including study order decisions, during learning. A variety of factors can influence students\u2019 study decisions (for a review, see Son & Metcalfe, 2000). For instance, when students have unlimited time for study, they may use a discrepancy reduction agenda. To do so, students contrast their current state of learning (e.g., I do not know the micrite category well) with their learning goal (e.g., I want to do well on the final test that will include multiple examples of micrite) and work to reduce (or eliminate) the difference between the two.\nTo reduce the discrepancy between the current state of knowledge and learning goal, students\u2019 performance during category learning and the feedback they receive may serve as an important cue for their study order decisions. Doyle and Hourihan (2016) found that participants are more confident in their classification ability following correct relative to incorrect practice. However, because students did not make self-regulated choices during learning, the relationship between practice classification performance and students\u2019 study order decisions is unknown. When a student correctly categorizes an exemplar, they may conclude that they have learned the category and are ready to move on to a different one. If so, the student may choose to switch to a different category on the next trial, which would lead to\ninterleaving. By contrast, when a student incorrectly categorizes an exemplar, they may conclude that they have not learned that category and should study it more. If so, they may choose to study that same category again, which would lead to blocking. We evaluated these novel predictions in five experiments on category learning.\nExperiments 1a and\u00a01b\nIn Experiments 1a and 1b, participants practiced classifying rock exemplars and self-regulated the order in which they studied. After each practice trial, participants made category choices by choosing to study a rock from the same category (stay) or from a different category (switch). We examined participants\u2019 choices following correct and incorrect trials. We also explored participants\u2019 choices across the serial-position of the self-regulated phase. Experiments 1a and 1b are reported together because they are nearly identical with the only difference being the counterbalance of response options for category choices during the self-regulated phase. We hypothesized that participants would decide to stay within a category at a substantially higher rate following incorrect relative to correct trials."

For each participant, six exemplars from each rock category were randomly assigned to the study phase\n1 3\nand the other six exemplars were assigned to the test phase. Thus, for each participant, 60 exemplars were assigned to the study phase and 60 exemplars were assigned to the test phase, for a total of 120 exemplars."

            "heading": "Procedure",
            "text": "Experiments 1a and 1b were conducted in person. In Experiments 1a and 1b (and all subsequent experiments), participants answered 12 questions about their geological knowledge (see https:// osf. io/ thmpv). Questions were self-paced, shown in a fixed order, and participants typed their response to each question. Then, participants began the familiarization phase, which was experimenter-paced to ensure that initial study time was equated between the groups. Participants were instructed to study each exemplar with the goal of classifying novel exemplars on a future test. The 60 exemplars were randomly ordered for each participant and were shown one at a time with the rock category name displayed beneath. After 3 s, the next exemplar automatically appeared.\nFollowing the familiarization phase, participants were instructed that they would practice classifying rock exemplars, and the goal of classifying novel exemplars on a later test was reiterated. During this self-regulated phase, participants practiced classifying the same exemplars that were seen in the familiarization phase. The first exemplar was randomly selected per participant and appeared on the screen for 3 s, then all ten category names were shown below it (for similar methodology, see Jones & Ross, 2011). The category names were presented in alphabetical order, which was fixed for each trial and identical for all participants. Participants classified the exemplar at their own pace by clicking the button with the corresponding category name (see Fig.\u00a01,\nleft panel), and they received basic feedback on the trial. When participants correctly classified the exemplar, they saw \u201cCorrect\u201d displayed above the exemplar for 3 s. When participants incorrectly classified the exemplar, they saw \u201cIncorrect\u201d displayed above the exemplar for 3 s, and the correct answer was not provided.\nNext, participants made a category choice. Participants responded to \u201cWhat type of rock do you want to study next?\u201d by selecting one of two buttons (see Fig.\u00a01, right panel). In Experiment 1a, the button on the left was labelled \u201cA rock from the same type that you just studied,\u201d and the button the right was labelled \u201cA rock from a different type.\u201d The button locations were fixed for all trials and all participants. As such, responses could have been biased by habitual left-toright responding. To address this possibility, we conducted Experiment 1b in which the button labels were identical to those of Experiment 1a; however, the button location was counterbalanced across participants. Importantly, in Experiment 1b, participants\u2019 choices did not differ based on button location during the self-regulated phase, t(28) = .099, p = .922.\nFor Experiments 1a and 1b, on trials for which the same rock category was selected (i.e., stay within a category), a different exemplar from that category was randomly selected and shown. For example, if a participant completed a trial with an exemplar of pumice and chose to study the same rock category, the following trial displayed a different exemplar of pumice. On trials for which a different rock category was selected (i.e., switch to a different category), an exemplar from a different rock category was randomly selected and shown. For example, if a participant completed a trial with an exemplar of pumice and chose to study a different rock category, the following trial\ndisplayed an exemplar from a different category, such as an exemplar of dolomite. Participants studied each rock category as many times as desired. If a participant chose to study a rock category for which they had previously studied all six of the study exemplars, then the exemplars were repeated on subsequent trials. Thus, participants could study all 60 study exemplars, and they could study them more than once. All aspects of the self-regulated study phase were self-paced.\nThe self-regulated trials \u2013 classification practice, feedback, and category choices \u2013 continued until a minimum of 20 trials had been completed per participant. We adopted this approach to meet the goal of obtaining at least 20 category choice observations per participant. After 20 trials, an option to terminate study was provided. Even so, at the outset of the self-regulated phase, participants were instructed to practice classifying as many exemplars as desired and for as long as they wanted. Participants were encouraged to only end the self-regulated phase when they had learned the rock categories well enough so that they would no longer need to guess on a future test.\nWhen participants terminated the self-regulation phase, they were directed to the final classification test. Participants classified exemplars that had never previously been seen from the ten rock categories that they studied. Exemplar order was randomized per participant. Beneath each exemplar, the ten rock categories were listed alphabetically and in the same fixed order for each trial and participant. Participants classified each of the 60 novel exemplars, one\nat a time, by selecting the button for a rock category. The test was self-paced, and no feedback was provided.\nExperiments 1a and\u00a01b: Results\nAll item level data, descriptive statistics, and analyses of outcomes at the category-level are provided in the OSM for all experiments (https:// osf. io/ thmpv)."

Thus, for participants in all experiments, the last trial of the self-regulated learning phase was not included in the total number of category choices, and it did not influence the mean percent of stay choices. Participants in Experiments 1a and 1b tended to stay within a category (see Table\u00a01), which is consistent\n1 3\nwith prior research establishing a preference to block. For all experiments, the length of blocks was explored by counting the number of study trials for which participants studied an exemplar from the same category as the prior trial. In Experiments 1a and 1b, blocks were just over four trials long. As well, most participants took the final classification test after correctly classifying an exemplar.\nParticipants in Experiment 1a correctly classified exemplars on 47.0% of the practice trials (Experiment 1b = 51.8% of practice trials), and few of their subsequent category choices were to stay within a category (Experiment 1a, M = 25.83, SE = 5.00; Experiment 1b, M = 30.39, SE = 3.90). By contrast, when participants incorrectly classified exemplars, most of their subsequent category choices were to stay within a category (Experiment 1a, M = 81.52, SE = 4.91; Experiment 1b, M = 85.20, SE = 2.53, see Fig.\u00a02).\nOf primary interest, students\u2019 study order decisions were investigated following correct and incorrect practice trials. For each experiment, mixed-effects model (MEM) analyses were conducted to examine the influence of practice classification performance on participants\u2019 decisions to stay (study the same type of rock) or switch (study a different type of rock) following each trial. Models were conducted using STATA (StataCorp, 2019) with random participant effects. Participants\u2019 decisions on each trial (1 = stay, 0 = switch) were the outcome of each model; go to test trials were excluded. Practice classification performance (0 = correct, 1 = incorrect) was included as a predictor. Trial order (first self-regulated trial = 1, etc.) was centered within participant and included in each model as a predictor and as a random participant effect (Hines et\u00a0al., 2009). For each experiment, the intercept and interaction terms were included. Predictors were recoded as needed to conduct follow-up analyses. The Experiment 1a and 1b models included one two-way\ninteraction between trial order and practice classification performance. To preview, all models show that practice classification performance significantly predicted students\u2019 category choices.\nExperiment 1a. Students were 46.99 times more likely to\u00a0stay following incorrect compared to correct classification, b = 3.85 (SE = .19), t = 20.52, p < .001, CI [3.48, 4.22]. Trial order predicted staying \u2013 with each additional correct trial, students were 1.02 times less likely to stay within a category, b = -.02 (SE = .01), t = -2.77, p = .006, CI [-.03, -.01]. The odds of staying did not significantly change with additional incorrect trials, b = -.006 (SE = .01), t = -.85, p = .395, CI [-.02, .01]. The interaction was not significant, b = .01 (SE = .01), t = 1.90, p = .058, CI [-.0004, .03]. Experiment 1b. Students were 25.79 times more likely\u00a0to stay following incorrect compared to correct classification, b = 3.25 (SE = .19), t = 17.10, p < .001, CI [2.88, 3.63]. Trial order significantly predicted staying \u2013 with each additional correct trial, students were 1.03 times less likely to stay within a category, b = -.03 (SE = .01), t = -3.64, p < .001, CI [-.05, -.02]. The odds of staying did not significantly change with additional incorrect trials, b = -.02 (SE = .01), t = -1.54, p = .123, CI [-.04, .005]. The interaction was not significant, b = .02 (SE = .01), t = 1.80, p = .073, CI [-.002, .04]."

Specifically, the odds of staying in the same category were 26\u201347 times higher following an incorrect trial compared to a correct trial, which was not impacted by trial order. A different pattern emerged for correct practice classification trials. When participants correctly classified exemplars during self-regulated practice, they typically chose to switch to a different category on the following trial. Further, stay rates changed for correct trials across the self-regulated learning phase. The odds of staying within a category decreased with additional correct trials, demonstrating that switch rates increased following correct trials as the list progressed.\nIn Experiments 1a and 1b, participants were required to complete 20 trials during the self-regulated phase before the option to take the final test was made available. Requiring a minimum of 20 self-regulated trials may have influenced participants\u2019 category choices. Some participants may have preferred to make fewer than 20 decisions. Indeed, some participants (five in Experiment 1a and six participants in Experiment 1b) proceeded to the test shortly after reaching the 20-trial minimum. Further, it is unclear if providing participants with the opportunity to terminate study and proceed to the test influenced their choices. Without the implied reminder of an upcoming test early during self-regulated learning, participants\u2019 study decisions may be less influenced by trial performance. We investigated this possibility in Experiment 2."

Participants in Experiment 2 tended to choose to stay within a category, which did not differ between the groups, t(58) = .54, p = .590.

These outcomes maintained for required and non-required trials (see OSM for analyses: https:// osf. io/ thmpv).\nMEM analyses were conducted that included group (0 = option to end early, 1 = option to end late) and interactions with group as predictors. The early group was 18.17 times more likely to stay following incorrect compared to correct classification, b = 2.90 (SE = .12), t = 14.85, p < .001, CI [2.52, 3.29].

The three-way interaction was driven by differences in how trial order predicted stay choices between the groups.

In Experiment 3, we explored reasons why students\u2019 study order decisions were related to practice classification performance in Experiments 1a, 1b, and 2.\nType of feedback provided may impact students\u2019 study decisions, particularly for incorrect trials. In the prior experiments, participants were provided with basic feedback as to whether their answer was correct without the correct category name. We selected this type of feedback intentionally to avoid introducing the name of a different category between the practice classification response and the study decision, which facilitated interpretation of students\u2019 subsequent choices to stay or switch their study. Even so, students may have often chosen to stay after incorrect practice classification so they could identify the correct answer for that trial. We investigated this possibility in Experiment 3 by manipulating the type of feedback that participants received.\nFurther, participants may use performance information to inform their study decisions. Incorrect classification during practice may be interpreted as an indication that the category is not well learned, which would result in choices to stay within a category following incorrect trials. Correct classification during practice may be interpreted as an indication that the category is learned well enough to move onto learning a different category, which would result in fewer choices to stay within a category and increased choices to switch to a different category following correct trials. To provide more insight into why participants made specific category choices, we gathered self-reported rationales for their choices at the conclusion of Experiment 3."

Feedback for the corrective feedback group included if their answer was correct or incorrect, and the correct rock category for the trial.\nFor Experiment 3, we developed four prompts probing for the reasons why participants made their study decisions.\nAfter the novel classification test, participants responded to the prompt \u201cWhen I incorrectly [correctly] answered a practice trial and selected to study the same type of rock [a different type of rock], I did so because..\u201d Prompts for study decisions following correct classifications were shown in green font and prompts for study decisions following incorrect classification were shown in red font.

By contrast, most participants reported that they chose to stay following correct classification to verify their knowledge before they moved on to a different rock type. Most participants indicated that they switched their study following correct classification because they felt they knew the rock type well enough and wanted to move on. When participants switched following incorrect classification, they did so for a variety of reasons and no specific options received a majority of endorsements.\nTo evaluate whether participants\u2019 responses differed between feedback groups, in Experiment 3 (and Experiment 4) six chi-square analyses with a Bonferroni correction to\nadjust the significance threshold to .008 for each analysis were conducted. Relative to the corrective feedback group, the basic feedback group was significantly more likely to report that they chose to stay following an incorrect classification to find the correct answer for the previous rock type, \u03c72 (1) = 11.38, p = .001.

Further, for both feedback groups, the likelihood of staying in the same category decreased with additional correct trials.

Relative to participants who receive a familiarization phase, those who do not may have poorer practice classification performance. Thus, participants who do not receive an initial familiarization phase may exhibit higher rates of staying within a category (particularly for incorrect trials) than those who do. We investigated this possibility in Experiment 4 by manipulating the presence of the familiarization phase.

For this group, trial order did not significantly predict staying for correct trials, -b = .02 (SE = .01), t = -1.88, p = .06, CI [-.04, .001], or incorrect trials, b = -.01 (SE = .01), t = -.84, p = .402, CI\n1 3\n[-.03, .01]. Feedback group was not a significant predictor of staying, b = -.70 (SE = .38), t = -1.84, p = .065, CI [-1.45, .04], nor was familiarization group, b = -.14 (SE = .38), t = -.36, p = .721, CI [-.88, .61]. However, there were four significant interactions (feedback group and trial order, b = -.04 (SE = .02), t = -2.17, p = .030, CI [-.07, -.004]; feedback group and practice performance, b = -1.43 (SE = .24), t = -5.92, p < .001, CI [-1.90, -.95]; familiarization group and practice performance, b = 1.08 (SE = .25), t = 4.26, p < .001, CI [.58, 1.57]; and a four-way interaction, b = -.06 (SE = .02), t = -3.35, p = .001, CI [-.10, -.02]).\nThe four-way interaction revealed that the basic feedback groups were 8.33 times more likely to stay within a category compared to the corrective feedback groups, b = 2.13 (SE = .39), t = 5.47, p < .001, CI [1.37, 2.89]. The groups without familiarization were also 2.56 times more likely to stay within a category relative to the groups with familiarization, b = .94 (SE = .39), t = 2.43, p = .015, CI [.18, 1.70]. Trial order significantly predicted staying for the basic feedback without familiarization group \u2013 with each additional correct trial, they were 1.02 times less likely to stay within a category, b = -.02 (SE = .01), t = -2.17, p = .03, CI [-.04, -.002]; however, trial order did not predict staying for incorrect trials for this group, b = .004 (SE = .01), t = .37, p = .708, CI [-.02, .02]. By contrast, for the corrective feedback + familiarization group, with each additional correct trial, b = -.06 (SE = .01), t = -4.62, p < .001, CI [-.08, -.03], and incorrect trial, b = -.06 (SE = .01), t = -4.33, p < .001, CI [-.08, -.03], students were 1.06 times less likely to stay within a category. Finally, for the corrective feedback without familiarization\ngroup, trial order predicted staying for correct trials, b = -.06 (SE = .01), t = -4.46, p < .001, CI [-.09, -.03], and incorrect trials, b = -.10 (SE = .02), t = -6.87, p < .001, CI [-.13, -.07]. Specifically, for the corrective feedback without familiarization group, with each additional correct and incorrect trial, students were 1.06 times and 1.10 times less likely to stay within a category, respectively.\nReplicating Experiments 1a, 1b, 2, and 3, although the magnitude of the association varied, practice classification performance was a significant predictor of students\u2019 category choices for all groups. There was variability in staying across the self-regulated learning phase; however, staying tended to decrease with trial order. Corrective feedback was associated with lower stay rates relative to basic feedback and students who received a familiarization phase were less likely stay within a category compared with those who did not receive a familiarization phase."

Consistent with Experiment 3, most participants reported that they choose to stay following incorrect classification because they felt they didn\u2019t know the rock type well enough and wanted to practice classifying it again. Most participants reported that they decided to stay following correct classification to verify their knowledge, and that they switched following correct classification because they felt they knew the rock type well enough and wanted to move on. Rationale for switching following incorrect classification varied across participants, and no options received a majority of endorsements.\nReplicating Experiment 3, more participants in the basic feedback groups (n = 37, 71.2%) relative to the corrective feedback groups (n = 20, 38.5%) endorsed selecting to stay following incorrect classification to find the correct answer for the previous rock type, \u03c72 (1) = 11.22, p = .001. More participants in the corrective feedback group (n = 24, 46.2%) relative to the basic feedback group (n = 9, 17.3%) reported switching following correct classification to see examples from different rock types back-to-back, \u03c72 (1) = 9.99, p = .002. Likewise, more participants in the corrective feedback group (n = 20, 38.5%) than the basic feedback group (n = 5, 9.6%) reported switching following correct classification to compare features from a previous rock type with the features of a different rock type, \u03c72 (1) = 11.85, p = .001. Finally, more participants in the basic feedback group (n = 17, 32.7%) relative to the corrective feedback group (n = 5, 9.6%) reported switching following incorrect classification because they thought the previous rock type was too challenging and they wanted to practice something else, \u03c72 (1) = 8.30, p = .004.

            "text": "The present experiments were the first to systematically explore students\u2019 study order choices for correct and incorrect trials during category learning. In all experiments, students\u2019 category choices were related to their performance during practice classification. Following incorrect practice classification, students chose to stay (contributing to blocking) on most trials. The opposite pattern was observed for correct practice classification trials. Following correct practice classification, students chose to stay on few study trials revealing that most study trials were switched (interleaved). These effects persisted regardless of the location of the category choice options on the screen (Experiment 1a vs. 1b), whether the option to terminate study became available after 20 practice trials (Experiment 1), ten practice trials\n(Experiment 2), or 40 practice trials (Experiment 2), when data were collected in person (Experiments 1a, 1b, & 2) or remotely (Experiments 3 and 4), with or without the correct answer provided during feedback (Experiments 3 and 4), and with or without a preceding familiarity phase (Experiment 4). These outcomes contribute to the growing literature on students\u2019 study choices during category learning (e.g., Morehead et\u00a0al., 2017; Wahlheim & DeSoto, 2017) and are relevant for theoretical perspectives on students\u2019 self-regulation during category learning.\nA useful cue for evaluating the status of encoding is correctness and feedback during practice classification trials. Thus, it is encouraging that outcomes from all experiments demonstrated that students\u2019 study order choices were related to prior trial correctness. For the reported experiments, students\u2019 learning agendas were likely informed by performance and feedback during practice classification, which produced changes in students\u2019 study choices (Dunlosky et\u00a0al., 2011). Relevant to this issue, self-report data (Experiments 3 and 4) revealed that most participants decided to switch to a different category following correct practice classification because they felt that the rock category had been well learned, and they were ready to study a different rock category. Future research could utilize category judgments to capture students' monitoring during learning and to evaluate the relationship between monitoring and category choices.\nThe type of feedback also impacted students\u2019 study order decisions. The effect of performance on stay category choices was smaller for participants who received corrective feedback (Experiments 3 and 4) \u2013 they chose to switch their study (interleave) more often relative to participants who received basic feedback. Further, for participants with corrective feedback, the odds of staying decreased as the self-regulated learning phase progressed. Increased switching by corrective feedback groups is likely attributable (in part) to a reduced need to search for the correct answer to the prior trial. Indeed, significantly fewer participants in the corrective feedback groups indicated that they decided to stay following an error to find the correct answer relative to those who received basic feedback. Even so, there were similarities in participants\u2019 reasons for deciding to stay following incorrect practice. For instance, many participants in both groups chose to stay following an error because they believed they had not learned the category well.\nThe rate of stay category choices was also impacted by an initial familiarization phase. As expected, the groups without the familiarization phase had higher stay rates relative to the groups who received the familiarization phase, which is likely attributable to better practice classification performance by the familiarity phase groups. The size of the stay effect was impacted by the presence of a familiarity phase for the corrective feedback groups but not for the basic feedback groups. Even so, what is most clear is that for all\n1 3\ngroups, participants chose to stay within a category significantly more after incorrect practice classifications relative to correct practice classifications despite overall differences in the rate of stay category choices between groups.\nWhereas the corrective feedback groups from Experiments 3 and 4 did not demonstrate an overall preference to stay within a category, all other groups from Experiments 1a, 1b, 2, 3, and 4 did. The preference to stay replicates prior research on blocking preferences (Kornell & Bjork, 2008; Tauber et\u00a0al., 2013) and is consistent with participants\u2019 self-reported preference to incorporate blocking into their study (Kornell & Bjork, 2008; McCabe, 2011; Morehead et\u00a0al., 2016; Yan et\u00a0al., 2017). The obtained stay rates were not as high as some previously reported blocking rates (but see Kornell & Vaughn, 2018), and there are a variety of explanations for this. In the present work, participants chose to stay or switch between categories, which is different from choosing to block study. Other methodological differences between studies may contribute to these differences. For instance, our outcomes suggest that the type of feedback delivered during self-regulation and whether participants have an initial familiarization phase may play a key role in the amount of stay decisions during self-regulated learning. Another potential factor may be that in some prior research participants completed practice classification trials during learning (e.g., Carvalho & Goldstone, 2014), but in others, study trials were completed (e.g., Tauber et\u00a0al., 2013). Prior research has explored category learning with study trials as compared to test trials (e.g., Yan et\u00a0al., 2016); however, choices following practice or study trials has not been examined. Future work should aim to explore the impact of trial type on participants\u2019 category choices.\nAlthough performance on the novel classification test was not our main interest, in one case novel classification\nperformance was benefitted by corrective feedback during self-regulated learning. This suggests that the type of feedback provided during learning plays an important role in novel classification performance (cf. Butler et\u00a0al., 2013; Finn et\u00a0al., 2018; Pashler et\u00a0al., 2005). However, the feedback effect on novel classification performance was small and it was not replicated in Experiment 4. It is possible that both forms of feedback (basic and corrective) support learning, but it was challenging to observe the benefits because groups who received no feedback were not included in our experimental designs. An important direction for future research will be to systematically evaluate feedback type during category learning tasks with the goal of establishing the forms of feedback that enhance classification performance.\nIn conclusion, participants preferred to stay within a category (block) following incorrect practice, and they stayed less (and thus, interleaved by switching more) following correct practice. The degree to which participants choose to stay following an error and switch following a correct answer was influenced by the type of feedback provided and the presence of an initial familiarization phase. As well, in most cases, participants were more likely to switch categories as they answered more trials correctly. These novel findings illustrate the influence of practice classification performance on study choices and contribute to a growing field of research on students\u2019 study choices when learning complex categories.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Payton Aydelott, Mia Clark, Kendall Drummond, Jacquelyn Huynh, Caylie Jordan, Sarah Jones, Truley Juneau, Kimberly Kammel, Cara Kusenberger, Aubrey Lumbatis, Kylie Tasu, and Addison Williams for their assistance with data collection.\nCode availability Not applicable.\nStay choices following incorrect practice classification refers to participants\u2019 responses to \u201cWhen I incorrectly answered a practice trial and selected to study the same rock, I did so because...\u201d Switch choices following incorrect practice classification refers to participants' responses to \u201cWhen I incorrectly answered a practice trial and selected a different type of rock, I did so because...\u201d Stay choices following correct practice classification refers to participants\u2019 responses to \u201cWhen I correctly answered a practice trial and selected to study the same rock, I did so because...\u201d Switch choices following correct practice classification refers to participants\u2019 responses to \u201cWhen I correctly answered a practice trial and selected to study a different type of rock, I did so because...\u201d Responses are listed from most endorsed to least endorsed (overall).
