    "abstractText": "How reliably can we trust the scores obtained from social bias benchmarks as faithful indicators of problematic social biases in a given model? In this work, we study this question by contrasting social biases with non-social biases that stem from choices made during dataset construction (which might not even be discernible to the human eye). To do so, we empirically simulate various alternative constructions for a given benchmark based on seemingly innocuous modifications (such as paraphrasing or random-sampling) that maintain the essence of their social bias. On two wellknown social bias benchmarks (WINOGENDER and BIASNLI), we observe that these shallow modifications have a surprising effect on the resulting degree of bias across various models and consequently the relative ordering of these models when ranked by measured bias. We hope these troubling observations motivate more robust measures of social biases.",

These measures are composed of textual datasets built for a specific NLP task (such as question answering) and are accompanied by a metric such as accuracy of prediction which is used as an approximation of the amount of social biases.\nThese bias benchmarks are commonly used by machine learning practitioners to compare the degree of social biases (such as gender-occupation\nhave gender-occupation bias (green tick) based on the change in its pronoun resolution. However, a minor change in its phrasing with no change in meaning (e.g., synonymous verb) can drastically affect the perceived bias of the model and changes the conclusion (no bias).\nbias) in different real-world models (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022) before deploying them in a myriad of applications. However, they also inadvertently measure other non-social biases in their datasets. For example, consider the sentence from WINOGENDER in Figure 1. In this dataset, any change in a co-reference resolution model\u2019s predictions due to the change in pronoun is assumed to be due to gender-occupation bias. However, this assumption only holds for a model with near-perfect language understanding with no other biases. This may not often be the case, e.g., a model\u2019s positional bias (Murray and Chiang, 2018; Ko et al., 2020) (bias to resolve \u201cshe\" to a closeby entity) or spurious correlations (Schlegel et al., 2020) (bias to resolve \u201che\u201d to the object of the verb \u201cwarned\u201d) would also be measured as a genderoccupation bias. As a result, a slightly different template (e.g., changing the verb to \u201ccautioned\u201d) ar X iv :2\n21 0.\n10 04\n0v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n6 Ju\nn 20\n23\ncould result in completely different bias measurements.\nThe goal of this work is to illustrate the extent to which social bias measurements are effected by assumptions that are built into dataset constructions. To that end, we consider several alternate dataset constructions for 2 bias benchmarks WINOGENDER and BIASNLI. We show that, just by the choice of certain target-bias-irrelevant elements in a dataset, it is possible to discover different degrees of bias for the same model as well as different model rankings1. For instance, one experiment on BIASNLI demonstrated that merely negating verbs drastically reduced the measured bias (41.64 \u2192 13.40) on an ELMo-based Decomposable Attention model and even caused a switch in the comparative ranking with RoBERTa. Our findings demonstrate the unreliability of current benchmarks to truly measure social bias in models and suggest caution when considering these measures as the gold truth. We provide a detailed discussion (\u00a75) of the implications of our findings, relation to experienced harms, suggestions for improving bias benchmarks, and directions for future work."

            "text": "A large body of work investigates ways to evaluate biases carried inherently in language models (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2017; Nadeem et al., 2021) and expressed in specific tasks (Nangia et al., 2020; Kirk et al., 2021; Schramowski et al., 2022; Prabhumoye et al., 2021; Srinivasan and Bisk, 2021; Kirk et al., 2021; Parrish et al., 2021; Baldini et al., 2022; Czarnowska et al., 2021; Dev et al., 2021a; Zhao et al., 2021). Alongside, there is also growing concern about the measures not relating to experienced harms (Blodgett et al., 2020), not inclusive in framing (Dev et al., 2021b), ambiguous about what bias is measured (Blodgett et al., 2021; Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2023), not correlated in their findings of bias across intrinsic versus extrinsic techniques (GoldfarbTarrant et al., 2021; Cao et al., 2022), and susceptible to adversarial perturbations (Zhang et al., 2021) and seed word selection (Antoniak and Mimno, 2021).\nThe concurrent work by (Seshadri et al., 2022) discusses the unreliability of quantifying social bi-\n1All preprocessed datasets (original and alternate constructions) and code are available at https://github.com/uclanlp/socialbias-dataset-constructionbiases.\nases using templates by varying templates in a semantic preserving manner. While their findings are consistent with ours, the two works provide complementary experimental observations. Seshadri et al. (2022) study a wider range of tasks, though we focus our experiments on a wider set of models and alternate dataset constructions (with a greater range of syntactic and semantic variability). As a result, we are able to illustrate the effect of the observed variability on ranking large language models according to measured bias for deployment in real world applications."

            "text": "Bias measures in NLP are often quantified through comparative prediction disparities on language datasets that follow existing tasks such as classification (De-Arteaga et al., 2019) or coreference resolution (Rudinger et al., 2018). As a result, these datasets are central to what eventually gets measured as \u201cbias\u201d. Not only do they determine the \u201camount\u201d of bias measured but also the \u201ctype\u201d of bias or stereotype measured. Datasets often vary combinations of gendered pronouns and occupations to evaluate stereotypical associations. It is important to note that these constructs of datasets and their templates, which determine what gets measured, are often arbitrary choices. The sentences could be differently structured, be generated from a different set of seed words, and more. However, we expect that for any faithful bias benchmark, such dataset alterations that are not relevant to social bias should not have a significant impact on the artifact (e.g. gender bias) being measured.\nThus, to evaluate the faithfulness of current benchmarks, we develop alternate dataset constructions through modifications that should not have any effect on the social bias being measured in a dataset. They are minor changes that should not influence models with true language understanding \u2013 the implicit assumption made by current bias benchmarks. Any notable observed changes in a model\u2019s bias measure due to these modifications would highlight the incorrectness of this assumption. Consequently, this would bring to light the unreliability of current benchmarks to faithfully measure the target bias and disentangle the measurement from measurement of other non-social biases. A non-exhaustive set of such alternate constructions considered in this work are listed below.\nNegations: A basic function in language understanding is to understand the negations of word groups such as action verbs, or adjectives. Altering verbs in particular, such as \u2018the doctor bought\u2019 to \u2018the doctor did not buy\u2019 should typically not affect the inferences made about occupation associations.\nSynonym substitutions: Another fundamental function of language understanding is the ability to parse the usage of similar words or synonyms used in identical contexts, to derive the same overall meaning of a sentence. For bias measuring datasets, synonymizing non-pivotal words (such as non-identity words like verbs) should not change the outcome of how much bias is measured.\nVarying length of the text: In typical evaluation datasets, the number of clauses that each sentence is composed of and overall the sentence length are arbitrary experimental choices. Fixing this length is common, especially when such datasets need to be created at scale. If language is understood, adding a neutral phrase without impacting the task-specific semantics should not alter the bias measured.\nAdding descriptors: Sentences used in real life are structured in complex ways and can have descriptors, such as adjectives about an action, person, or object, without changing the net message expressed by the text. For example, the sentences, \u201cThe doctor bought an apple.\", and \u201cThe doctor bought a red apple.\" do not change any assumptions made about the doctor, or the action of buying an apple.\nRandom samples: Since the sentence constructs of these datasets are not unique, a very simple alternate construction of a dataset is a different subsample of itself. This is because the dataset is scraped or generated with specific assumptions or parameters, such as seed word lists, templates of sentences, and word order. However, neither the sentence constructs or templates, nor the seed word\nlists typically used are exhaustive or representative of entire categories of words (such as gendered words, emotions, and occupations).\nSee Fig. 2 for example constructions on WINOGENDER (App. A, B for detailed descriptions)."

We work here with WINOGENDER (Rudinger et al., 2018), popularly used to measure biases. It is worth noting that WINOGENDER was originally intended by its authors to merely be a diagnostic tool that checks for bias in a model; the authors note that it may demonstrate the presence of model bias but not prove the absence of the same. Nonetheless, models developed today are indeed tested and compared for social bias on WinoGender, leading to its usage as a comparative standard or benchmark (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022).\nThe metric used to evaluate bias is the percentage of sentence pairs where there is a mismatch in predictions for the male and female gendered pronouns. For instance, in Fig. 2, if the pronoun \u201che\u201d is linked to \u201cengineer\u201d but switches to \u201cclient\u201d for the pronoun \u201cshe\u201d, that would indicate a genderoccupation bias. Higher the number of mismatches,\n2We note that throughout this paper, we focus on genderoccupation bias as an illustrative example; however, our discussion can be extended to other aspects of biases too.\nhigher the bias. In particular, note that the metric does not take into account the accuracy of the predictions, but rather only the mismatch between the two pronouns.\nWe experiment with three alternate constructions of the dataset: addition of clauses, addition of adjectives, and synonymizing words in templates. Each alternate construction is introduced so as to not affect the overall meaning of the sentence. Experimental Results: We use an end-toend coreference model with SpanBERT embeddings (Lee et al., 2018; Joshi et al., 2020), UnifiedQA (small, base, and large) (Khashabi et al., 2020) QA model,3 and a long-document coreference model with Longformer encodings (Toshniwal et al., 2021). Results of evaluating these models on various WINOGENDER constructions is summarized in Fig. 3a. Small changes to the formulation of dataset templates result in sizable changes to computed bias measures compared to the published baseline constructions. For example, a construction involving added adjectives after occupations would have found the UnifiedQA (large) model to have 10% less bias compared to the default constructions. The sensitivity to the dataset constructions can have a drastic effect on ranking models according to their social bias, as Fig. 3a shows. For example, the SpanBERT model is considered to have less bias than UnifiedQA (small) model in the baseline dataset, but would be considered to be more biased if the templates had clauses after the participants or adjectives before the occupation.\n3Used by converting co-reference into question-answering, e.g., \u201cThe technician told the customer that he had completed the repair. Who does the word \u2018he\u2019 refer to? \\n (a) technician (b) customer\""

Experimental Results: We use RoBERTa trained on SNLI (RoBERTa-base-SNLI) (Liu et al., 2019), ELMo-based Decomposable Attention (ELMoDA) (Parikh et al., 2016), ALBERT (Lan et al., 2019), distilled version of the RoBERTa-base model (Sanh et al., 2019), and RoBERTa-large finetuned on WANLI (Liu et al., 2022). The bias measured with each model using BIASNLI is recorded in Fig. 3b. The results show how small modifications to the dataset again result in large changes to the bias measured, and also change the bias rankings. For example, adding a negation largely reduces the bias measured (\u25b3 = 28.24) for ELMoDA, and also results in a switch in the comparative ranking to RoBERTa-base-SNLI. Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 4, there is a significant overlap in the bias measures of ALBERT, DistilRoBERTa, and ELMo-DA under random sampling,4 which corresponds to high variability in relative model ordering across different sub-samples of the dataset."

            "text": "Social bias measurements are very sensitive to evaluation methodology. Our empirical evidence sheds light on how the model\u2019s non-social biases brought out or masked by alternate constructions can cause bias benchmarks to underestimate or overestimate the social bias in a model. More interestingly, it is important to note that different models respond differently to perturbations. In fact, the same perturbation can result in a higher or lower measured bias depending on the model (as seen in \u00a74.1 and \u00a74.2), which points to how models might parse information (and thus bias) differently.\nWhile current bias measures do play a role in exposing where model errors have a stereotypical connotation, a lack of sentence construction variability or even assumptions made when creating seed word lists can reduce the reliability of the benchmarks, as we see in this work (\u00a74.2). Even with simple sentences, it is not apparent how to disentangle the biased association of the identity with the verb or the occupation amongst others. This is especially important to note as it highlights that measures can lack concrete definitions of what bi-\n4Also observed at 25% and 50% samples in Fig. 5(App.)\nased associations they measure. Consequently, the relation between measured bias and experienced harm becomes unclear.\nWe hope that our troubling observations motivates future work that thoroughly investigates how to construct robust benchmarks that faithfully measure the target bias without being affected by model errors and other non-social biases. As suggested by our subsampling experiments (Appendix F), it might be fruitful to encourage both syntactic and semantic diversity in these benchmarks. Bias benchmarks that provide uncertainty measures (instead of a single number) might enable practitioners to better compare models before deploying them. Furthermore, since the opaqueness of large language models makes it challenging to understand how and to what extent a linguistic change will affect the measured bias, explainable models might indeed facilitate better measurement of their social bias. Assuming that we can generate faithful explanations for a model\u2019s predictions, an exciting future direction is to explore construction of bias benchmarks which operate on the explanations of the predictions rather than the predictions themselves. Lastly, we also encourage discussions on the complexity of the sentences used in benchmarks and their implications on what gets measured in relation to un-templated, naturally-occurring text (Levy et al., 2021), as an attempt to ground our measurements in experienced harms.\nLimitations\nWe acknowledge the underlying assumptions of the social bias benchmarks used in our study. While the presented study aims to point out a key limitation of currently accepted methodologies, the presented investigation could benefit from more diversification. First, this study focuses on English. While we expect similar issues with similarly-constructed benchmarks in other languages, we leave it to future work to formally address the same. Also, the bias benchmarks themselves imbibe the notion of fairness with the Western value system (Bhatt et al., 2022), and future explorations of benchmarks should diversify culturally as well. Last but not least, we acknowledge the harm of binary treatment of genders in one of the target benchmarks. The purpose of this work was to bring light to a broader problem regarding the reliability of social benchmark metrics, with the hypothesis that the main idea of this paper would hold for a wider\nrange of datasets with other assumptions or notions of fairness. We also acknowledge that there are larger models that we were not able to train and evaluate due to the limitations on our computational budget. The current study was focused on benchmarks with templated instances. This is no coincidence: the dominant majority of the social bias benchmarking literature relies on sentences with some degree of known structure, even in those collected from the wild (Levy et al., 2021). Such structural assumptions in datasets are necessary for defining and extracting quantifiable measures of social bias, which as we argue, are the reason behind the brittleness of their decisions. Future work should focus on making our bias benchmarks more diverse and robust to small decisions that go into making them.\nBroader Impact\nBias evaluating benchmarks play a very significant role in helping identify potential risks of language technologies. While a large body of work evolves in this area of work, there is growing concern about the ability of the different benchmarks to accurately quantify and identify social biases. We emphasize these concerns by evaluating how robust the benchmarks are to alternate constructions based on simple linguistic properties. It is important to note how inaccurate measurements of social biases can be problematic by underestimating or misdiagnosing the potential harm from language models. We hope our work helps identify such pitfalls."

We do it in four distinct ways, (i) adding the descriptor to the occupation mentioned, e.g. doctor (e.g., \u201cdoctor\u201d to \u201cgood doctor\u201d), (ii) adding it to the occupation as a separate clause (e.g., \u201cdoctor\" to \u201cthe doctor who was good\u201d), (iii) adding the descriptor to the participant mentioned, e.g., \u201cclient\u201d (similar to (i)), and (iv) adding it to the participant as a separate clause (similar to (ii))."

We empirically estimate the distribution of bias scores across samples of a fixed proportion by using 100 independent random trials for that proportion. See Figure 5 for results. Observe that overlap in the distributions serves as a proxy for possible inversions in model ordering (by bias) depending on the subsample of template occupation words used. It is also worth noting that as we use more diverse sets (that is, bigger proportions) of seed words, the variance in the measured bias reduces."
