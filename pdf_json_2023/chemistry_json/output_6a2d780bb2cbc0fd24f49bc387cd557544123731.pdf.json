    "abstractText": "Diosgenin, (25R)-spirost-5-en-3\u03b2-Ol (Figure 1), is a phytosteroidal compound extracted from the rhizome of dioscorea. Studies have shown that diosgenin has antieffects on blood lipid, diabetes, thrombus, myocardial ischemia, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation, allergy, immune regulation. Concurrently, it also has a resisting effect on neoplasm, nephropathy, encephalomyelitis, osteoporosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and plays a beneficial role in pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, diosgenin is also an important basic raw material for the preparation of steroids and contraceptives in the pharmaceutical industry. Recently, diosgenin is likely to become one of the new drugs to prevent corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). compound of natural anti-tumor drugs. However, natural diosgenin often has the problems of low yield and low bioavailability, and some dioscoreaceae have become highvalue endangered medicinal plants. Consequently, it is extremely important to transform diosgenin into a more efficient and selective utilization way. In the present study, we put focus on the antitumor effect and action pathway of diosgenin, as well as its antitumor effects as nano carriers, combined drugs and the structural modifi cation of diosgenin, in order to provide more clues for the deeply development of diosgenin with higher antitumor activity and lower toxicity.",

It had an obvious inhibitory effect on OSCC cells PE/ca-pj15 with the dosage 100 \u03bcmol/L diosgenin.(22)\nDiosgenin decreased the ora l tumor inc idence\nsignifi cantly in male Syrian golden hamster cheek pouch\nat the dose of 80 mg/kg by oral administration every other day for 16 weeks.(23)\nEsophageal Cancer Esophageal cancer is a common malignant tumor\nof digestive system. Diosgenin mainly have an obvious\nrole on esophageal cancer cells Eca109. It could inhibit\nesophageal cancer cells proliferation, migration and\ninvasion, and induce apoptosis with an optimal measure of 50 g/mL on Eca109.(24,25)\nGastric Cancer Previous studies have shown that diosgenin have\neffects on human gastric adenocarcinoma cells mainly\ninclude BGC823, MGC803, SGC7901, MNK45 and\nAGS cells, which inhibited the proliferation, growth and\ninvasion, promoted apoptosis of BGC823 and MGC803 gastric cancer cells,(26,27) inhibited the growth of MGC803\nand SGC7901 cells and increased the apoptosis rate of MGC803 cells to 30.08% with the dosage at 60 \u03bcg/mL.(28)\nFurthermore, diosgenin caused a dose-dependent decrease\nin the AGS and SGC7901 cells viability, induced signifi cant increases in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. (29)\nColon Cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most lethal gastrointestinal tumors.(30) Results from the in vitro\nexperiments indicated that diosgenin can inhibit the growth\nof human colon cancer cells SWILLC, the activity of SW480\ncells and cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as\nthe proliferation of colorectal cancer cells SW1116 and RKO\nin a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, diosgenin\ncan induce the apoptosis of colon cancer cell lines, HT-29 and HCT-116, in a dose-dependent manner.(31-34) Results\nfrom the in vivo experiments indicated that diosgenin could\ninhibit preneoplastic colonic lesions aberrant crypt foci in azoxymethane-induced rat colon carcinogenesis.(33)\nLiver Cancer Liver cancer is one of the most common malignant\ntumors occurred worldwide, which has emerged as a main health trouble and accounts for leading cancer-related death.(17)\nDiosgenin has obvious inhibitory effect on liver cancer, it\nsignifi cantly inhibited the growth of Bel7402, SMMC7721 and\nHepG2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, induced\nG2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of hepatoma cells, and inhibited cell migration and invasion.(17,35,36) Moreover, a study\nalso found that when rat hepatoma cells CBRH7919 were\ntreated with 50 \u03bc/L diosgenin, the apoptosis rate was 29.67%, the inhibition rate was 89.3%, and the cell cycle was blocked.(37)\nPancreatic Cancer Pancreatic cancer, one of the most aggressive and\nlethal malignancies worldwide, is a refractory and intractable\ndisease. It had been found that diosgenin induced apoptosis\nand G2/M phase recovery of pancreatic cancer cells Patu8988 and Panc-1, and significantly inhibited the proliferation of\npancreatic cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent\nmanner. Additionally, diosgenin could also signifi cantly inhibit the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells.(38)\nOthers Diosgenin was found to have efficient antitumor\npotential of human cholangiocarcinoma cells in vitro and\nin vivo, it could inhibit the progression of HUCCT1 cells\nand tumor growth in xenografts of nude mice in vivo tumor studies.(39) Except above, diosgenin was sensitive to human salivary adenocarcinoma cells.(40)\nRespiratory System Tumors Laryngeal Carcinoma\nSquamous cell carcinoma is common in laryngeal\ncancer. Diosgenin had an effect on not only inhibiting\nthe proliferation of human laryngeal cancer cells Hep-2,\nbut also the invasion of human laryngeal cancer cells\nHep-2 and TU212, causing apoptosis and DNA damage,\nincreasing the level of reactive oxygen species, and inducing S-phase arrest.(41,42)\nLung Cancer Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with\nthe highest mortality worldwide, among which nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) makes up about 80%.(43)\nA previous study had shown that diosgenin attenuated\nthe lung histopathological changes such as pulmonary edema, coagulation and infi ltration of infl ammatory cells,(44)\nand further experiments indicated that diosgenin played\na significant role in anti-lung cancer activities, it could\ninhibit the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase gene,(45) suppress the A549 cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner,(46) and it could inhibit the growth of human SCLC cells NCI-H446.(47)\nGenitourinary System Tumors Prostate Cancer\nProstate cancer is the second most common\nmalignant tumor in men,(48) especially in elderly men.(49)\nRecently, plenty of research indicated that diosgenin is\nimportant in the treatment of prostate cancer, it could inhibit\nthe proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer\ncells PC-3, mediate autophagy and increase the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells DU145 and LNCaP,(50,51) and\nconcentration-dependently decreased prostate cancer cells viability.(48,52) In addition, diosgenin also decreased the level\nof carcinogenic protein in transgenic mice and inhibited the development of prostate tumor.(49)\nBreast Cancer Breast cancer is the most common cancer among\nwomen, affecting about 12% of the world's female population.(53) Diosgenin could not only inhibit the growth\nof human breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231,\nbut also inhibit its survival and proliferation. Meanwhile,\ndiosgenin inhibited cell viability and stimulated apoptosis, reduced cell invasion.(41,54,55) Moreover, diosgenin treatment\nresulted in cell MCF-7 and Hs578T growth inhibition,\ncell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, and all the results are in concentration- and time-dependent manners.(56)\nCervical Cancer Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of\ndeath among women in the world. Diosgenin had been\ncorroborated antitumor effect on cervical cancer in vivo and\nin vitro. It had an inhibitory effect on the growth of human\ncervical cancer cells HeLa, and inhibited cell proliferation\nand induced apoptosis of cervical cancer cells HeLa and SiHa, as well as CaSki cervical cancer cells.(41,57,58)\nAdditionally, diosgenin inhibited U14 mice transplant tumor with inhibition rates of 30%\u201350%.(59)\nBladder Cancer Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy of\nthe urinary tract and the incidence of bladder cancer ranks first among urinary tract malignant tumors in China.(60)\nDiosgenin could inhibit the proliferation of bladder cancer\ncells 5637 and T24, prevent cell migration and invasion,\ninduce apoptosis, and kill bladder tumor cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.(61,62)\nHematopoietic System Tumors Leukemia is a malignant disease of hematopoietic\nsystem. Diosgenin had an inhibitory effect on human chronic\nmyeloid leukemia cell K562, it could inhibit the proliferation\nof K562 cells and induced cell cycle G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis and it also induced WEHI-3 murine leukemia cells cell cycle arrest and apoptotic.(63,64) Furthermore, diosgenin\ncould produce reactive oxygen species, induce autophagy,\nenhance the apoptosis of leukemia cells K562 and BaF3WT, and achieved anticancer effect.(65) Besides, the in vivo\nstudy demonstrated that diosgenin had marked antitumor effi cacy against tumors in the WEHI-3 cell allograft model.(64)\nOthers Except above, diosgenin played a crucial role in human astrocytoma cells U251.(47) Meanwhile, diosgenin\nshowed anti-tumor effects in rat C6 and human glioblastoma\ncells T98G by induction of differentiation and apoptosis and inhibition of migration, invasion, and angiogenesis.(32)\nIn addition, diosgenin had similar inhibitory effects on the\nproliferation of melanoma cells M4B, inhibited the growth\nof cells A375-S and it was more dependent on anti-tumor\nimmunity and improved the composition of gut microbiome in melanoma-bearing C57BL/6 mice.(47,66,67)\nOsteosarcoma is a kind of osteogenic malignant\ntumor, which has a high incidence in primary malignant bone tumors.(68) Diosgenin could inhibit the invasion and\nmigration of osteosarcoma cells MG63 and U2OS, the\nproliferation of human osteosarcoma cell 1547, as well\nas osteosarcoma cell S180, and it could block the cell cycle in G1 phase and induce apoptosis.

            "text": "Plenty studies have shown that the anti-tumor\noccurrence and development of diosgenin is often\naccompanied by multiple mechanisms at the same time,\nwith multi-targets and multi-pathways (Appendix 1). It\nmainly includes inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and\ngrowth, promoting tumor cell apoptosis, inducing tumor cell\ndifferentiation, inhibiting tumor cell metastasis and invasion,\nblocking cell cycle, inhibiting tumor signal transduction,\nimproving immunity and improving gut microbiome through\nthe mechanism of cell autophagy (Figure 2).\nInhibiting Proliferation and Growth of Tumor Cells, Promoting Apoptosis, Inducing Differentiation and Autophagy\nExtensive researches have shown that diosgenin\ninhibits the proliferation and growth of tumor cells,\nthe anti-tumor effect of diosgenin through downregulation of the MAPK, Akt and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.(72)\nEqually, diosgenin could effectively inhibit ERK, JNK\nand PI3K/AKT signaling pathways against pancreatic\ntumor cells. In addition, diosgenin inhibited the activity of\nNF-\u03baB through NF-\u03baB signal pathway, the activation of\nNF-\u03baB/STAT3, resulting in a signifi cant decrease in the\nexpression of many oncogene products, thus inhibits the proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells.(49,50,73)\nDiosgenin may promote the proliferation and differentiation\nof MG-63 cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal\npat hway thereby reducing the number of calcified\nnodules and inhibiting the expression of osteopontin and osteocalcin in the cells.(12) Moreover, diosgenin inhibited\naerobic glycolysis by mediating glucose transporters\n(GLUT) such as GLUT3 and GLUT4, and inhibits CREB\nphosphorylation through cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway, thus inducing apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells.(30)\nMitochondria-Mediated Apoptosis Pathway Mitochondrial apoptosis pathway plays a central role\nin the process of apoptosis. Diosgenin induced apoptosis\nwith the increased expressions of cytosol cytochrome C,\ncleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-PARP1 and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.(39) Similarly, diosgenin induced apoptosis in HepG2\ncells through Bcl-2 protein family-mediated mitochndria/\ncaspase-3-dependent pathway. It is particularly known that\nthe proto-oncogene BcL-2 was discovered with the cloning\nof the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation responsible for\nhuman follicular lymphoma. Other members of the Bcl-2\nfamily have been identified to be important in tumor\noccurrence and development, and altered expression levels\nof various members serve as prognostic markers in many lymphoid malignancies.(74) Caspases are cysteinyl aspartate\nspecific proteinase and members of the interleukin-1beta-\nconverting enzyme family containing cysteine, which is\nclosely related to eukaryotic cell apoptosis and participates in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis.(75)\nThe activation and function of caspases, involved in the\ndelicate caspase-cascade system, are regulated by various\nkinds of molecules, such as the inhibitor of apoptosis protein, Bcl-2 family proteins, calpain, and Ca2+. The p53 gene is a\ntypical tumor suppressor gene, mutations and inactivation\nof p53 tumor suppressor gene are common events in the development of all or most types of human cancers.(76,77)\nDiosgenin could induce DNA damage and then\ninduce apoptosis of K562, bladder cancer, rectal cancer,\nglioblastoma cancer neoplasm cells by significantly up-\nregulating the protein levels of Bak, Bax, Bid, p53, caspase-3\npromotes apoptosis, and induces cell differentiation and\nautophagy mainly by regulating signal pathways, regulating\nthe expression of genes and proteins, increasing the level\nof reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing intracellular Ca2+ concentration and inhibiting angiogenesis.\nRegulating Signal Pathway The signal pathway plays an important part in\nthe anti-tumor effect of diosgenin, it mainly involves\nmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal\npathway, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)\nand c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal pathway,\nphosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), Akt, nuclear factor\nkappa B (NF-\u03baB)/STAT3 pathway, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal\npathway and cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. MAPK signal\npathway is shared by four distinct cascades, including the\nextracellular signal-related kinases (ERK1/2), Jun amino-\nterminal kinases (JNK1/2/3), p38-MAPK and ERK5, and\nMAPK/ERK pathway is reported to be associated with the\ncell proliferation, differentiation, migration, senescence and apoptosis.(70) Diosgenin may regulate the proliferation,\napoptosis, migration and invasion of esophageal, colon\ncancer and osteosarcoma cells through inhibiting the\ninitiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and\nthen inhibiting p38-MAPK signal pathway with EMT-related\nproteins such as transforming growth factor \u03b21, E-cadherin\nand vimentin, and induce apoptosis of A549 cells via related MAPK signal pathway proteins caspase-8, -9 and -3.(68,71)\nNoticeably, the anti-tumor effect of diosgenin may\nalso be carried out through multiple pathways at a same\ntime. Diosgenin could inhibit the phosphorylation of\nNF-\u03baB/p65, IKK-\u03b2, Akt, ERK, and JNK, which indicated\nNotes: ROS: reactive oxygen species; MAPK: mitogenactivated protein kinase; NF-\u03baB: nuclear factor kappa B; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK: c-jun N-terminal kinase; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; cAMP:cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA:protein kinase A; CREB: cAMPresponse element binding protein\nand -9, and down-regulating the protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Survivinm RNA.(30,32,41,57,63) Calcium homeostasis\nis one of the main targets of endoplasmic reticulum stress, the destruction of Ca2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction play an important role.(10) Diosgenin was\nawakened by erythrocyte contraction and disturbance of\nerythrocyte membrane phospholipids, which was parallel to Ca2+ infl ux, oxidative stress and ceramide.(9) Diosgenin can\nplay a role in mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis through calcium homeostasis regulation, cause Ca2+ release, reduce the concentration of Ca2+, and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.(52)\nRegulating Expression of Genes and Proteins Diosgenin can up-regulate autophagy marker LC3\nprotein, reduce the ratio of LC3-\u2160 to LC3-\u2161, induce autophagy of hepatoma cell.(78) Moreover, diosgenin\nregulated p21 mRNA expression, which is related to the\nactivation of nuclear factor UUB and the synthesis of\nprostaglandin E2, miR-145 expression level and methylation status, down-regulated cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and\nmicrosomal prostaglandin E synthase (MPGES)-1, and\nsignificantly up-regulated miR-34a expression and down-\nregulated the expression level of miR-34a target genes E2F1, E2F3 and CCND1, which could inhibit gastric,(79) lung(80) and breast cancers proliferation.(81) Interestingly,\ntelomerase activity is not detected in typical healthy cells,\nwhile in cancer cell telomerase expression is reactivated, therefore providing a promising cancer therapeutic target.(82)\nDoubtlessly, diosgenin inhibited telomerase activity by\ndown-regulating the expression of telomerase reverse\ntranscriptase gene HTERT in A549 lung cancer cells and\nincreased the expression of glial fi brillary acidic protein GFAP\nto induce glioblastoma cell differentiation, and decreased the\nabundance of dedifferentiation markers Id2, N-Myc, TERT and Notch-1 to reduce cell dedifferentiation.(32,45) Diosgenin\nexerts anti-cancer effect through inhibiting mesoderm\nposterior 1 (MESP1) expression in gastric cancer cells, promotes the cell proliferation, apoptosis, and growth.(26)\nIncreasing Level of ROS ROS are the main molecules produced by the body\nin the process of oxidative stress, and the accumulation of ROS in cells can lead to cell death.(30) A series of studies\nhave shown that diosgenin strongly generated ROS and\nthis oxidative stress might induce apoptosis through\nactivation of ASK1, which are critical upstream signals for JNK/p38 MAPK activation in HepG2 cancer cells.(83)\nThe production of ROS was observed and autophagy\nand apoptosis were induced by regulating ROS-mediated\nDNA damage and mitochondrial signal pathway in the\nexperimental studies of diosgenin against human chronic myeloid leukemia,(63) laryngeal cancer,(42) cervical cancer(57) and colorectal cancer.(65)\nInhibiting Angiogenesis Angiogenesis is one of the main factors in tumor growth, metastasis and invasion.(84) Vascular endothelial growth\nfactor (VEGF) is the most important regulator of angiogenesis\nand differentiation, which mediated signal transduction pathway participating in all processes of angiogenesis.(85)\nVEGF not only provides nutrition and waste excretion\npathway for tumor, but also provides a pathway for tumor\ncells to enter the circulatory system and binds to the\ncorresponding receptor VEGFR to play a biological role.\nOtherwise, the vascular endothelium plays a vital role in\ncoordinating angiogenesis and vascular tone. The vascular\nendothelium is one of the largest organs in the body and\nconsists of a single layer of highly specialized cells with site-specifi c morphology and functions.(86) VEGF can induce\nendothelial cell division, proliferation and migration by\npromoting endothelial cell germination, so as to accelerate\nthe degradation of vascular basement membrane, promote\nthe formation of foot ring, enhance the activity of endothelial\ncells, promote angiogenesis, tumor growth and invasion.\nDiosgenin could inhibit the anti-angiogenesis of HIF-l \u03b1,\nGRP78, VEGFFR, PI3K/AKT, ERK1/2 and FAK signaling\npathways, inhibit the expression of VEGF and tubular\nformation of endothelial cells in cancer cells and inhibit\nangiogenesis by reducing the protein levels of VEGF and fi broblast growth factor 2 (FGF2).(32,50) Diosgenin signifi cantly\nreduced IKK\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB phosphorylation with inhibition of\nTNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production in endothelial cells. Meanwhile,\ndiosgenin also remarkably inhibited endothelin-1 (ET-1) and\nplasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) production in the\nendothelial cells, and markedly restored the loss of insulinmediated vasodilation.(87) Therefore, inhibiting VEGF and\nvascular endothelium of tumor angiogenesis is an important\nway to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.\nInhibiting Tumor Cell Metastasis and Invasion Clinically, many patients with malignant tumors have\nmetastasis at the time of diagnosis, tumor cells can escape\nfrom the primary tumor site, and metastasis and invasion often take place at the same time.(88) Therefore, the prevention\nand inhibition of tumor metastasis is a key issue that needs to\nbe paid attention to. A large number of studies have shown\nthat the main mechanism of tumor cell migration and invasion\nis related to the reduction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs)\nexpression, including MMP-2 and -9. The literature show\nthat diosgenin inhibited the transcription of MMP-2, -9, -7\nmRNA gene and extracellular MMP inducer and reduced their activity.(30,32) In addition, diosgenin can significantly\nup-regulate the expression of E-cadherin, integrin\u03b15 and \u03b26, zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) and Cludin-1 proteins,(29) and down-\nregulate the expressions of N-cadherin, NMMC-cadherin, vimentin, ZEB1, EZH2, \u03b2-catenin protein(38) and PI3K/AKT signal pathway proteins PI3K, AKT, P-AKT,(27) regulate\nmiR-145-5p/KLF5/HIF-1\u03b1 pathway and Rho/ROCK signaling pathway,(89) thus inhibit the migration and invasion\nof human lung adenocarcinoma, gastric, bladder, pancreatic,\nprostate and colorectal cancer.\nBlocking Cell Cycle The anti-tumor mechanism of diosgenin is related\nto blocking tumor cell cycle. The cell cycle is a complex\nprocess referred to as G1, S, G2, and M phases that involves numerous regulatory proteins that direct the cell through a\nspecific sequence of events culminating in mitosis and the\nproduction of two daughter cells. Central to this process are\nthe cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which complex with the\ncyclin proteins. These proteins regulate the cell's progression\nthrough the stages of the cell cycle and are in turn regulated\nby numerous proteins, including p53, p21, p16, and cdc25.\nDownstream targets of cyclin-CDK complexes include pRb and E2F.(90) Diosgenin caused G2/M, S and G0/G1 phase arrest by decreasing cyclin B1 and p21chip1/Waf1 levels,\nincreasing cdc2 levels, inhibiting PI3K-Akt and up-regulating\nthe expression of p21 and p27, increasing the number of\nG2 phase cells, regulating cycle-related gene CDK2/4/6, CyclinD1, which inhibited the proliferation of human chronic myeloid leukemia,(63) osteosarcoma,(69) OSCC,(22) hepatoma and pancreatic cancer.(38)\nRegulating Immunity and Improve Gut Microbiome Recently, gut microbiome, as a research hotspot\nhuman health, is a kind of microorganism with a large\nnumber in the human intestinal tract, which is considered as one of the important factors affecting the tumor.(91,92) In\nfact, many concepts of Chinese medicine (CM) coincide\nwith modern research results of gut microbiome, and CM is\nalso widely used to regulate gut microbiome disorders, and\nplays a very important role in restoring the dysfunctional gut microbiome.(93,94) Recent studies indicated that composition\nof the gut microbiome affects immune system development and modulates immune mediators.(95) Reasonably, as an\nactive ingredient of CM, diosgenin had been found an important role in regulating gut microbiome.(96) Certainly,\nit could exert its anti-tumor effect by regulating immune\nbalance and improving the composition of gut microbiome,\nthe response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy is related to gut\nmicrobiome and effector T cells in tumor microenvironment.\nDiosgenin can be used as a microecological regulator to\ninduce anti-tumor immunity and improve the efficacy of\nimmune checkpoint antibodies. In anti-bearing melanoma,\ndiosgenin depends on anti-tumor immune effect and improves the composition of gut microbiome.(67) However,\nthe research on the gut microbiome mechanism of anti-\ntumor effect of diosgenin is in the ascendant. In terms\nof regulating immunity, diosgenin also stimulated the\nexpression of cytokine genes essential for the functioning\nof the human immune system IL-10, IL-1, IL-12, IL-4 and TNF-\u03b1 in breast cancer and prostate cancer.(97,98) On the\nother hand, diosgenin signifi cantly inhibited the expression\nof Ptgs2 and Ptges and decreased the number of COX-2\nand membrane-bound prostaglandin e2 synthase 1 (mPGES-1) immunoreactive cells in hepatic sinusoid.(81)"

The FJXF combined with transcatheter arterial\nchemoembolization (TACE) treatment signifi cantly prolonged\nthe 1-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival\n(PFS) of patients with HCC. After a literature search, 8\nmain components of FJXF, which may be related to the\nAKT/CyclinD1/p21/p27 pathway, were found: diosgenin,\nformononetin, chlorogenic acid (CGA), caffeic acid, luteolin, gallic acid, ergosterol endoperoxide, and lupeol.(99)\nA randomized study was performed on 64 patients\ndiagnosed with tumor cachexia (age: 35\u201375 years) and\ntreated with Shenling Baizhu Powder (\u53c2\u82d3\u767d\u672f\u6563, SLP)\nfor 4-weeks.

            "text": "More efficient, non-toxic and selective pathways\nof diosgenin anticancer are needed to solve the few\nsources of diosgenin products and its low bioavailability.\nThe construction of targeted nano-drug carriers, the drug\ncombination, and the diosgenin derivative are established to\ngive full play to the anticancer effect of diosgenin (Figure 3).\nbased nano-carriers can effectively inhibit the proliferation\nof breast cancer cells, while the diosgenin polycaprolactone\nnanoparticles (PCL-F68-D-NPs) with PluronicF68 as\nsurfactant inhibit glioblastoma and it was found that the\ncontinuous release of diosgenin was due to the release of\ndiosgenin wrapped in polymer matrix and the hydrophobic interaction of polymer-diosgenin in nanoparticles.(106,107)\nMoreover, a novel pH-sensitive polymer prodrug of\ndiosgenin and methoxy-polyethylene glycol-4-formylbenzoate\n(mPEG-CBA) nanoparticles (NPs) and an octagonal\npolyethylene glycol-diosgenin conjugate 8armPEG-\nDGN/HCPT polymer nanoparticles were synthesized to\nimprove the synergistic therapeutic efficiency of diosgenin on tumor cells.(108,109) Inorganic nanoparticles refer to\nnanoparticles deprived from inorganic materials, including\nthe metallic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanoparticles, ceramic nanoparticles, etc.(110) Diosgenin to synthesize\nsilver nanoparticles could improve ascites lymphoma by regulating blood indexes and inhibiting peroxidation.(111)\nIron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have gained immense\nimportance recently as drug nanocarriers due to easy\nmultifunctionalization, simultaneous targeting, imaging and\ncancer hyperthermia. Diosgenin functionalized IONPs can be\nconsidered as fi rst diosgenin functionalized novel magnetic\nnanomedicine with antiproliferative, migration inhibiting and apoptosis inducing properties against breast cancer.(112)\nDrug Combination The anti-tumor effect of diosgenin combined with\ndiosgenin played a stronger inhibitory activity than diosgenin\nalone, and its mechanism is consistent with the anti-tumor\nmechanism of diosgenin. Previous researches have shown\nthat diosgenin could combinate with tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand,(46) PD-1 antibody,(67) GSK126,(29) autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine(51) and HIF-1\u03b1 specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA)(27) which\naggravate tumor necrosis and apoptosis of NSCLC, gastric\ncancer and prostate cancer via increasing the activation of\ncaspase-8, -9, -3, Bid, PARP cleavage and Bax expressions,\ndecreasing the expression of Bcl-2, inducing enhanced T cell\nresponse, inhibiting MAPK signal pathway, PI3K/Akt/mTOR\nsignal pathway, targeting EZH2 via Rho/ROCK signaling\nmediated EMT. GSK126 is a highly selective EZH2 inhibitor\nand also a newly synthesized S-adenosylmethionine\ncompetitor. Moreover, diosgenin could play a role in application of compound CM with active ingredients,(2) for\ninstance, diosgenin with thymoquinone could inhibit the\nproliferation and induce apoptosis in common skin cancer and laryngeal cancer though Akt and JNK phosphorylation.(100)\nTargeted Nano Drug Delivery System in Anticancer of Diosgenin\nNano-drug delivery systems (DDSs) hold immense\npotential in enhancement of drug therapeutic effi cacy for their\ncapability of preventing drug degradation and sustaining drug release.(105) Nano-drug delivery has good biocompatibility,\nhigh drug loading, good flexibility and controlled release,\nand has been widely used to deliver insoluble drugs to\ninhibit tumor. Numerous nano-DDSs carrying therapeutic\nagents are springing up unprecedentedly and adopted in\npromoting cancer healing of diosgenin, mainly including\nnanohydrogel and nanofbrous structures. Nanohydrogel is\nthe 3-dimensional polymeric networks, the biocompatibility\nproperties and uses of polycaprolactone (PCL) nanoparticles\nhave been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.\nPCL is a hydrophobic polymer formed by ring-opening\npolymerization of \u03b5-caprolactone to form PCL and PCL-\nDiosgenin combined with formononetin, chlorogenic acid,\ncaffeic acid, luteolin, gallic acid, ergosterol endoperoxide,\nand lupeol may function through the AKT/CyclinD1/p21/p27 pathways inhibiting hepatocellular carcinoma.(99)\nDiosgenin Derivatives Natural products derivatives are a major source of\nnewly developed drugs, the current two main methods for\ngenerating diosgenin derivatives of antitumor are through standard organic synthesis or using biocatalysts.(113,114)\nAs the most widely used method, chemical semi-synthesis\nrapidly produces a series of derivatives that are used for\nstructure\u2013activity relationship analysis by conjugating\ndifferent substituent groups to the modifiable site via\nesterification, acylation, etherification, or click chemistry.\nA set of diosgenin derivatives that are substituted with\nvarious amino acids, glucoside, esters were synthesized\nf rom diosgenin. Glucosamine der ivat ives were\ncommon synthesized. (25R)-spirost-5-en-3\u03b2-ylO-\u03b2-D-\nglucopyranoside(3GD), (25R)-spirost-5-en-3\u03b2-yl O-\u03b1-L-\nrhamnopyranosyl-(1\u21924)-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (3GRD);\nand (25R)-spirost-5-en-3\u03b2-yl O-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranosyl-\n( 1 \u2192 2 ) - O - [ \u03b1 - L - r h a m n o p y r a n o s y l - ( 1 \u2192 4 ) ] - \u03b2 -\nDglucopyranoside), also known as dioscin, a natural,\nbioactive steroid saponin, has been widely used in anti-\ntumor research and it can inhibit proliferation of cervical\ncancer cells, suppresses TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT and suppresses lung cancer migration and invasion, etc.(115-117)\nA potential anti-cancer compound from the leaf extract\nof Lagerstroemia speciosa, as a derivative of diosgenin,\nwhich can be a possible candidate for cancer therapeutics\nin future, against pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1), and induce apoptosis.(118) 22-Oxo-26-selenocyanocholestanic\nsteroids based on diosgenin synthesized including\ndiosgenin 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-b-D-glucopyranoside,\nhecogenin 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-b-D-glucopyranoside,\ndiosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-b-D-glucopyranoside\nhydrochloride, exhibited remarkable antiproliferative activity against HeLa cells.(119)\nOtherwise, carbamate derivatives have been\nsynthesized at C26 of furostene ring after opening\nspiroketal bond (F-ring) of diosgenin. Furostene carbamate\nderivative 10 inhibited triple negative breast cancer cells\nsignifi cantly by arresting cell cycle at G1 phase and induced apoptosis by activating caspase-3.(53) The necessity of the\n1,4-quinones at C-3 position as well as the opening of the\ncyclic spiroketal revealed that the activities depended on\nthe type of 1,4-quinone moiety, hybrid 11a upregulated Bax,\nCl-caspase-3/9, and Cl-PARP levels, and downregulated\nBcl-2 level of HepG2 cell line and hybrid 11a could increase the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species.(120)\nDG-8d, bearing 1,3,4-oxadiazole/thiadiazole moieties, could\ndown-regulate Bcl-2, PI3K, p-Akt and p-FOXO3a signal\nmolecules, up-regulate Bax and Bim signal molecules,\ninhibit lung cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signal pathway.(121) FZU-0021-194-P2\n(P2) showed more potent cytotoxic activities against human NSCLC.(122) In addition, a fl uorophore-appended derivative of\ndiosgenin [Glc/CNHphth-diosgenin (GND)] was synthesized,\nstarting from diosgenin and glucosamine hydrochloride in\noverall yields. GND induced autophagy to activate caspase8-dependent liver cancer apoptosis.(123) A set of diosgenin\nderivatives substituted with various amino acids, a dipeptide\nor levulinic and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid at C-3 position\nthat have displayed a high antiproliferative activity towards breast and prostate cancer.(97) Azasteroids from the\nmodifi cation of the A and B rings of diosgenin inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells.(124) Recently, diosgenin\nderivatives spung up and these successful examples\ndemonstrated that the steroidal structure of diosgenin is\npromising for the discovery of new anticancer drugs."

This review\nfocuses on reviewing the anticancer species and related\nmechanisms of diosgenin, revealing the anticancer effects of\ndifferent sources of diosgenin on tumors at different doses\nthrough multiple pathways, such as inhibition of tumor cell\nproliferation and growth, promotion of apoptosis, induction\nof differentiation and autophagy, inhibition of metastasis and\ninvasion, cell cycle blockade, regulation of immunity and\nimprovement of the gut microbiome, showing potential for\nthe treatment of cancer.\nThese mechanisms are closely related to signaling\npathways and oncogenic factors. MAPK is an important\ntransmitter that carries signals from the cell surface to the\ninterior of the nucleus, phosphorylated extracellular signal-\nregulated kinase (pERK) is part of the MAPK network and\nthe ERK MAPK pathway is one of the most important for cell proliferation.(70) Equally, PI3Ks are crucial coordinators\nof intracellular signaling in response to the extracellular\nstimulators, the hyperactivation of PI3K signaling pathway is one among the most ordinary events in human cancers.(127)\nAkt is a serine/threonine kinase and it participates in the\nkey role of the PI3K signaling pathway, once activated,\nAkt modulates the function of many downstream proteins\ninvolved in cellular survival, proliferation, migration, metabolism, and angiogenesis.(128) Furthermore, the typical\ntumor suppressor p53 is often mutated in regulating cell proliferation, senescence, DNA repair, and cell death.(77)\nMoreover, NF-\u03baB signal pathway is increasingly recognized\nas a crucial player in many steps of cancer initiation and\nprogression and it is one of the best understood immune-\nrelated pathways. Above all, NF-\u03baB plays a major role in\nthe host response to microbial infection through orchestrating innate and adaptive immune functions.(129-131)\nNoticeably, gut microbiome is receiving significant\nattention and has been found to be closely related to a\nvariety of tumors, evidence suggesting that modulating the\ngut microbiome may affect responses to numerous forms of cancer therapy.(132) Hence, in view of the above results we\nspeculate that MAPK, p53, AKT and NF-\u03baB may be targets\nfor cancer treatment by diosgenin. Clinical investigations\nhave revealed diosgenin's clinical dosage and safety\nproperty. However, there are also some problems in clinical\nresearch, such as small amount of data, incomplete and\ninsuffi cient research scope. Previous study has shown that\ndiosgenin has poor water solubility, short circulation time in\nvivo, low biocompatibility, and unsatisfactory pharmacokinetic properties, which limit the clinical application of diosgenin.(108)\nTo improve the bioavailability of diosgenin in tumors, their\nefficacy can be further improved by nano-drug carriers,\ncombination with other drugs and design of higher active\ndiosgenin derivatives. However, participating in the\nconstruction of targeted nano-drug carriers and combined\ndrug use are still in their infancy and need to be further\nstudied, and the diosgenin derivatives are much more than\nwhat is mentioned in this review. Certainly, diosgenin could\nsynthesize labeled probe with biotin and exert the same anti-tumor activity as diosgenin.(133) Nonetheless, complete\nknowledge about the biosynthesis pathway of diosgenin is still elusive, which needs to be further investigated.(134)\nIn conclusion, diosgenin is an important anticancer\nnatural product, its mechanisms have multiple targets,\nmultiple pathways, and multiple effect nature. Presently,\nsome more efficient anticancer pathways of diosgenin\nhave been excavated. However, the antitumor microbial\nmechanism of diosgenin is in the ascendant and further\nwell-designed clinical trials are needed to observe the gut\nmicrobiome's effect in clinical application of diosgenin."
