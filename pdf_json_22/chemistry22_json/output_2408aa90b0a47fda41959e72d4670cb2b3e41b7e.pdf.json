    "abstractText": "In order to discuss the polymerization effect from the substituted position and methoxy group of Type I photinitiators, a series of naphthalene-based oxime esters was designed and synthesized. Compared to the 2-naphthalene-substituted compound, the UV absorption region of the 1-naphthalene-based compound was greatly improved. In addition, the methoxy substitution exhibited longer absorption characteristics than did the methoxy-free one. The photochemical reaction behavior of these novel compounds was also studied by photolysis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments. Finally, the initiation abilities of naphthalene-based oxime esters toward trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) monomer were conducted through the photoDSC instrument under UV and a 405@nm LED lamp. Remarkedly, the naphthalene-based oxime ester (NA-3) that contains 1-naphthalene with o-methoxy substituent showed the rather red-shifted absorption region with the highest final conversion efficiency under UV (46%) and 405@nm LED (41%) lamp irradiation.",

In addition, the photopolymerization kinetics can be precisely controlled spatially and temporally compared to the thermal polymerization [3\u20135]. Furthermore, both of the living and nonliving radical photopolymerization had been adopted and developed currently. For example, a photoinduced methodology with controlled radical polymerizations allowed the precise control of molecular weight (MW) and molecular weight distribution [6\u20138]. On the other hand, the nonliving radical polymerization is most widely used in various established and emerging applications, including coatings, inks, dentals, 3D printings, and microelectronics [9\u201314]. This kind of polymerization photopolymerization is generally classified into two pathways, (1) the free radical polymerization (FRP) [15] and (2) the cationic polymerization (CP) [16]. Among them, FRP had been utilized in an acrylate-based system and many of them were adopted in coatings, adhesions, and photolithography industrial applications [15,17]. Based on the radical generation mechanism for the nonliving types, there are two types for FRP systems including (1) a Type I (one-component photoinitiator) and (2) a Type\nPolymers 2022, 14, 5261. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14235261 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 5261 2 of 13\nII photoinitiaing system (two-components photoinitiator requiring the hydrogen acceptor and hydrogen donor package). Among all, the Type I photoinitiator is more efficiently on the radicals\u2019 generation. In addition, this one-component photoinitiator can avoid the phenomenon of uneven mixability in the phototinitiating system [18]. Aromatic organic compounds such as ketals, benzoins, acetophenones, oxime esters, acylphosphine oxides, etc., are considered as the common structural backbone skeleton for the Type I photoinitiators [19\u201321]. Oxime esters are currently under intense investigation because of their highly efficient N\u2013O bond cleavage propensity. That is, the N\u2013O bond is broken easily from the light irradiation and then generated the iminyl and carbonate radicals. Furthermore, the decarboxylation process-generated CO2 might solve the polymerization inhibition in the presence of oxygen [22,23] (shown below). Up to now, some heterocyclic-based oxime esters such as coumarin-based [24,25], carbazole-based [26\u201329], phenothiazine-based [30], thiophene-based [31,32], and chalcones-based photoinitiators [33], were designed for achieving higher photoreactivity under specific light irradiation conditions. In our previous study, we also synthesized series of triphenylamine-based oxime esters [18,34,35]. Obviously, through the modification, various oxime esters had different characteristics and reactivities. Currently, fused aromatic rings were also adopted and prepared in oxime ester systems. Lalevee et al. developed two series of pyrene and anthracene-based oxime esters [36]. The results showed that pyrene-based oxime esters were the most sufficient photoinitiating systems compared to anthracene ones. Alternative fused aromatic rings, naphthalene and its derivatives have also been designed to be used as efficient photoinitiators [37]. A naphthalene-based structure is expected to have a planar geometry with good electron delocalization characteristics. Therefore, in this work, a series of naphthalene-based oxime esters (NA-1\u20134) were prepared (Scheme 1). Through the changing of the substituted position and the methoxy substituent of the naphthalene moiety, their photochemical properties and photoinitiating abilities are investigated and compared in detail. The naphthalene chromophore is assumed to react mainly through a triplet state pathway (triplet state (T1) quantum yield ~80% vs. singlet state (S1) quantum yield ~20%) [38]. In addition, the presence of a methoxy group (e.g., for 1-methoxy naphthalene) significantly decreases the intersystem crossing (from ~80% to ~50%) and increases the singlet state quantum yield from ~20% to ~40%) [39]. The study of new oxime esters based on naphthalene chromophore is very interesting to shed some light on the S1 or T1 cleavage processes.\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 13\nof them were adopted in coatings, adhesions, and photolithography industrial applications [15,17].

All the testing samples were dissolved in deuterated chloroform. Fourier-transform mass spectrometry (FT-Mass) was recorded using a JEOL AccuTOF GCx-plus instrument, Japan. Elemental analyzer (EA) was performed on an elemental analyzer equipment (elementar, model: UNICUBE, Germany). Ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV-vis) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) (concentration = 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 M) and measured by using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV\u2013visible and Hitachi F-4500 spectrometer, US (excitation wavelength = 330 nm), respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of the samples were measured by using a BioLogic SP-150 model at a scan rate of 100 mV s\u22121 in the range of 0 to \u22122 V and 0 to 2.0 V. All testing was conducted at room temperature in DCM solution (concentration = 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 M) with a conventional three-electrode configuration, in which the three electrodes were a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. Melting point (Tm) of the samples was determined under nitrogen atmosphere with a scan rate of 10 \u25e6C min\u22121 by using Perkin Elmer DSC 6000A. Thermal decomposition temperature (Td) of the samples was conducted under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 15 \u25e6C min\u22121 by using the TA Instruments SDT Q600 Simultaneous DTA-TGA instrument. The samples analyzed had a mass of 3\u20135 mg and the Td was taken as the temperature at which 5% weight loss had occurred. Photolysis result of the selected samples (NA-1 and NA-2) was dissolved in DCM (concentration = 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 M) and measured by using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV\u2013visible. The absorption intensity of the solution was determined at various durations of exposure under a Philips 16 W lamp (type Actinic BL; \u03bb = 365 nm). Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of the selected samples was conducted at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere by using a Bruker EMX Plus X-Band spectrometer. Ultra-high-pressure mercury (MUV-250U-L, \u03bb = 250\u2013450 nm, microwave power = 5 mW) was used as an irradiation source to generate related radicals. The radicals were trapped by N-tert-Butyl-\u03b1-phenylnitrone (PBN), and tertbutylbenzene as a solvent in accordance with a procedure described in the literature [40]. The concentration of PBN and oxime esters was 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 and 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 M, respectively. The photopolymerization reactivity of the formulations was measured under nitrogen atmosphere (flow rate = 20 mL min\u22121) at 30 \u25e6C by using Perkin Elmer DSC 6000 photoDSC analysis instrument, US. A UV lamp (intensity = 180 mW cm\u22122; \u03bb = 250\u2013450 nm) or LED@405 nm (intensity = 180 mW cm\u22122) was used as radiation sources.

Heat flow versus time curves\nPolymers 2022, 14, 5261 5 of 13\nwere recorded to analyze the reaction of unsaturated moieties in the system during light irradiation. By integrating the area under the exothermic peak, the double bond conversion efficiency (DC; %) could be calculated using the following Equation (1) [41]:\nDC = (\u2206Ht/n \u00d7 \u2206Hotheor) \u00d7 100% (1)\nwhere \u2206Ht is the total reaction heat enthalpy within the exposure time, and \u2206Hotheor is the theoretical reaction heat enthalpy of one acrylate for complete conversion. \u2206Hotheor was 86 kJ mol\u22121 [42].

            "text": "To investigate the photoreactivity of the methoxy and position-substituted naphthalenebased oxime esters, in this study, four oxime esters (NA-1\u20134) were obtained using several facile steps: (a) the Vilsmeier\u2013Haack formylation reaction involving aromatic napthalenes, POCl3, and DMF to generate the corresponding aldehyde precursors; (b) the oximation reaction between carbonyl compound with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and (c) the condensation reaction with acetic anhydride in the presence of a base as a catalyst (Scheme 1). Remarkedly, the intermediates in the oximation reaction step are directly subjected to a condensation reaction without purification. The oxime esters could be obtained with reaction yields in the range of 39 to 59%. All the oxime esters were characterized through 1H NMR, 13C NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) (Figures S1\u2013S12; Supporting Information). In addition, the elemental analysis (EA) (see experimental part) of the oxime esters is also conducted. All the spectra and data are well consistent with the purposed ones demonstrating that the oxime esters have been synthesized successfully. In addition, all the oxime esters showed good dispersity in the testing monomer TMPTA. Therefore, a good mixability was expected to be achieved for the photoinitiating compositions. UV\u2013visible absorption spectra of the oxime esters (NA-1\u20134) were conducted in DCM and the related curves and data are illustrated in Figure 1a and Table 1. The spectra of this series contained a board absorption region below 400 nm. The absorption peaks were attributed to the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* electronic transition accompanied by slight charge-transfer characteristics. The maximum absorption in the longer-wavelength band for NA-1\u20134 was 294, 312, 348, and 328 nm, respectively. NA-2 had longer absorption region than did the NA-1 compound because the former compound had a longer conjugation length. In addition, the spectra of NA-3 and NA-4 contained methoxy group in their structure, exhibited a longer absorption region than did the methoxy-free of NA-2. Furthermore, the NA-3 compound exhibited a stronger red-shift than did the NA-4 due to the better conjugation characteristics of o-methoxy than the m-methoxy substitute. The photoluminescence (PL) results of NA-1\u20134 are shown in Figure 1b and Table 1. The emission peaks of NA-1\u20134 were located at 371, 371, 382, and 383 nm. Comparing NA-1 to NA-2, although NA-2 had a longer conjugation length through the 1-naphthalene substitution, both of them exhibited similar maximum emission peaks. Furthermore, NA-2 exhibited a smaller PL intensity owing to the larger twist angle between 1-naphthalene and oxime ester [44]. In addition, the NA-3 exhibited a higher PL intensity compared with the NA-4 analog. According to the literature [45], the high emitting intensity might decline the triplet yield while the radicals are assumed to be generated from the triplet state. However, singlet state cleavage and the influence of the molecular structure on the intersystem crossing efficiency from single state to triplet state cannot be ruled out.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 5261 6 of 13\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 13\n300 350 400 0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nEx tin\nct io\nn Co\nef fic\nie nt\n(1 05\nM -1\nc m\n-1 )\nWavelength (nm)\nNA-1 NA-2 NA-3 NA-4\n(a)\n400 500 600 0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nEm is\nsi on\nIn te\nns ity\nWavelength (nm)\nNA-1 NA-2 NA-3 NA-4\n(b)\nFigure 1.

The oxidation potential of the compounds (Figure 3a) had the following order: NA-1 (1.64 V) > NA-2 (1.62 V) > NA-3 (1.39 V) > NA-4 (1.35 V). As expected, NA-3 and NA-4 oxidize at a relative lower oxidation potential because of t presence f an electron-donating methoxy substitution in its naphthalene unit [47]. Furthermore, the NA-1 was oxidized at the highest potential due t the presence of the 2-na hthalene ccompanie by methoxy-free in its structure. Furthermore, the reduction pot ntials of NA-1\u20134 were investigated. The related curves are displayed in Figure 3b. The reduction potentials were ranging from -1.13 to -1.25 V. Generally, the LUMO orbitals for all the compounds are mainly composed of oxime ester moiety [18]. Among all, NA-1 showed the lowest reduction potential as it contained 2- naphthalene substituted in its structure.\nFigure 3. (a) Oxidation and (b) reduction potentials obtained from cyclic voltammograms of NA-1\u20134 in CH2Cl2 solution (scan rate 100 mVs\u22121).\nSteady state photolysis experiments of the selected NA-1 and NA-2 sample were carried out upon a Philips 16 W lamp (type Actinic BL; \u03bb = 365 nm) (Figure 4). Within 2 min of light irradiation (\u03bb = 365 nm), the selected compounds showed insignificant photolysis behavior because the NA-1 and NA-2 samples had poor absorption at 365 nm. However, another light irradiation source, which had a different light intensity region, might exhibit different photolysis characteristics. We conducted radical concentration under UV irradiation (250 to 450 nm). The radicals generated by the selected NA-2 and NA-3 samples were conducted through ESR instruments. The related experimental ESR spectra are shown in Figure 5. Clearly, the spectral intensity of the NA-3 compound is higher than that of the NA-2 compound. Thus, the radical concentration of NA-3 is higher and is expected to have better photoreactivity than the analogous NA-2-based one.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 5261 8 of 13\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 13\nSteady state photolysis experiments of the selected NA-1 and NA-2 sample were carried out upon a Philips 16 W lamp (type Actinic BL; \u03bb = 365 nm) (Figure 4).

Thus, a photoinitiating system was prepared and exposed under the UV lamp and their photoreactivity results are shown in Figure 6 and Table 2.

Clearly, the methoxy-free of NA-2 and its formulation produced poor photoreactivity in contrast to other methoxysubstituted-based formulations. In addition, the NA-3-based formulation showed a higher photoreactivity, possibly due to the boarder absorption characteristic and higher radical concentration (see Figure 5).\nPolymers 2022, 14, 5261 9 of 13\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 13\nbased iminyl radical and methyl radical could be obtained for subsequent photopolymerization (Scheme 2).\nScheme 2.
