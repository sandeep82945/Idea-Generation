    "abstractText": "Coumarin and chalcone, two important kinds of natural product skeletons, both exhibit \u03b1glucosidase inhibitory activity. In this work, coumarin-chalcone derivatives 3 (a~v) were synthesized, and their \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity was screened. The results showed that all synthetic derivatives (IC50: 24.09 \u00b1 2.36 to 125.26 \u00b1 1.18 \u03bcM) presented better \u03b1glucosidase inhibitory activity than the parent compounds 3-acetylcoumarin (IC50: 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u03bcM) and the positive control acarbose (IC50: 259.90 \u00b1 1.06 \u03bcM). Among them, compound 3t displayed the highest \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50: 24.09 \u00b1 2.36 \u03bcM), which was approximately 10 times stronger than that of acarbose. The kinetic assay of 3t (KI = 18.82 \u03bcM, KIS = 59.99 \u03bcM) revealed that these compounds inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase in a mixed-type manner. Molecular docking was used to simulate the interaction between \u03b1-glucosidase and compound 3t.",

One of the key reasons for the hyperglycemia is the enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates. \u03b1-Glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) plays an important role in carbohydrate digestion, in which the oligosaccharides and disaccharides from dietary carbohydrates are broken down into monosaccharides. The \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors suppress the absorption and assimilation of monosaccharides and delay the digestion of carbohydrates (Cohen and Goedert, 2004; Proen\u00e7a et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2019). Some commercially available \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, including miglitol, voglibose, and acarbose, have been used in the clinical treatment of T2DM, but they still show several adverse effects (Chai et al., 2015; Khursheed et al., 2019; Rocha et al., 2019). In addition, \u03b1-glucosidase is closely related to hepatitis, cancer, and Pompe disease (Kasturi et al., 2018; Gulcin et al., 2019). Therefore, it is always beneficial in medicinal chemistry to develop potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors.\nCoumarin is an important natural product skeleton with various pharmacological properties; among these, its anti-hyperglycemic activity is the focus of our research (Kontogiorgis et al., 2012; Katsori and Litina, 2014; Adib et al., 2018). Previous studies have shown that natural products containing the coumarin moiety and synthesized coumarin derivatives exhibit anti-hyperglycemic activity through the inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase (Adib et al., 2018). For instance, Wang et al. (2016) reported on a series of coumarin-thiazoles with the highest \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50 = 6.2 \u03bcM). Salar et al. (2016) developed 3-thiazolyl coumarins with the most potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.12 \u03bcM) (Salar et al., 2016)). Ibrar et al. designed coumarinyl iminothiazolidinones with the most effective inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.09 \u03bcM) (Ibrar et al.,\nEdited by: Xi Zheng,\nRutgers, The State University of New Jersey, United States\nReviewed by: Chaoqun Li,\nShaanxi Normal University, China Yushui Bi,\nShandong First Medical University, China\nRen Qinggang, Guangdong University of\nPetrochemical Technology, China\n*Correspondence: Zhuang Xiong\nwyuchemxz@126.com Na Feng\nwyuchemfn@126.com Chen Li\nwyuchemlc@126.com\n\u2020These authors have contributed equally to this work\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to\nOrganic Chemistry, a section of the journal Frontiers in Chemistry\nReceived: 22 April 2022 Accepted: 05 May 2022 Published: 27 June 2022\nCitation: Hu C-M, Luo Y-X, Wang W-J, Li J-P,\nLi M-Y, Zhang Y-F, Xiao D, Lu L, Xiong Z, Feng N and Li C (2022)\nSynthesis and Evaluation of CoumarinChalcone Derivatives as \u03b1-\nGlucosidase Inhibitors.

(Figure 1) Chalcone, an important sub-structure widely existing in many natural products, has the ability to bind to a variety of targets, resulting in many biological activities (Bak et al., 2011; Feng et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2018; Djemoui et al., 2020; Rocha et al., 2020; Dorn et al., 2010).\nIn medicinal chemistry, the hybrid of pharmacophore and skeleton is an effective strategy for obtaining active lead compounds. Until now, many coumarin-chalcone derivatives had been synthesizedwithmany biological properties, such as antioxidant, anti-cancer, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties (Pingaew et al., 2014; Seidel et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2018). However, there were few reports on the application of \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors. Therefore, we synthesized coumarin-chalcone derivatives 3a~v and screened their inhibitory activity against \u03b1-glucosidase."

In the presence of piperidine, salicylaldehyde 1) reacted with ethyl acetoacetate to produce 3-acetylcoumarin (2). Then 3- acetylcoumarin 2) and the substituted aldehydes underwent the aldol condensation reaction under the catalysis of piperidine to give coumarin-chalcone derivatives 3(a~v) (Scheme 1).

The parent compounds 3- acetylcoumarin only showed low inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 1.5 \u00d7 105. Interestingly, all synthetic derivatives showed moderate to good inhibitory activity towards \u03b1-glucosidase with IC50 values ranging from 24.09 \u00b1 2.36 to 125.26 \u00b1 1.18 \u00b5M.

Compound 3a (IC50: 125.26 \u00b1 1.18 \u03bcM) without any substituent was selected as the template compound. It could be seen that the introduction of various substituents resulted in an obvious change in inhibitory activity. For compound 3b (IC50: 95.23 \u00b1 1.35 \u03bcM) with a 4- methyl group, its inhibitory activity slightly increased compared to 3a. For compounds 3(g~i) with the fluorine group, 3(l~n) with the trifluoromethyl group, 3(o~q) with the chlorine group, and 3(r~t) with the bromine group, all presented stronger inhibitory activity than compound 3a, indicating that electron-withdrawing groups such as fluorine, trifluoromethyl, chlorine, and bromine could lead to an increase in inhibitory activity. Among them, 3i with the 4-fluorine group (IC50: 35.68 \u00b1 0.28 \u03bcM), 3n with the 4-trifluoromethyl group (IC50: 53.58 \u00b1 1.95 \u03bcM), 3q with the 4-chlorine group (IC50: 29.74 \u00b1 2.68 \u03bcM), and 3t with the 4-bromine group (IC50: 24.09 \u00b1 2.36 \u03bcM) showed higher inhibitory activity than the 2- and 3-position groups. For compounds 3j and 3k with difluoro groups, the introduction of 2,4-difluoro groups (3j, IC50: 30.30 \u00b1 2.53) resulted in the stronger inhibitory activities. While for compounds 3(c~e) with methoxy group, the 2-position group (3c, IC50: 60.89 \u00b1 2.74) was better than 3-position group and 4-position group.\nFurthermore, the sequencing of inhibitory activity was identified: 3t (with 4-bromine group) > 3q (with 4-chlorine group) > 3i (with 4-fluorine group) > 3n (with 4-trifluoromethyl group), predicting that stronger electron-withdrawing groups led to weaker inhibitory activity as for the compounds with electron-withdrawing groups.

(Pogaku et al., 2019; Saeedi et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019). 10 \u03bcl of the test compound and 10 \u03bcl of the enzyme (final concentration 0.1 U/ ml) were added to 130 \u03bcl of PBS (0.1M phosphate, pH 6.8), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min. Then p-NPG (final concentration 0.25mM) was added and the absorbance change was measured by a micro-plate reader at 405 nm. All experiments were assayed four times. The percentage of inhibition was obtained using the formula: Inhibition (%) = [(OD1 - OD0)/OD0] \u00d7 100%, where OD1 and OD0 represent the absorbance value of the experimental group and the blank group respectively. Acarbose as a positive sample was also tested. The IC50 value of each compound was obtained from the fitting curve of inhibition vs. compound concentration.\nThe type of inhibition was identified by the plots of enzymatic reaction rate (V) vs. \u03b1-glucosidase concentration. The test method was similar to the above enzyme activity assay. In the presence of different concentrations of compounds 3j, 3q and 3t, respectively (0, 25, 30, and 40 \u03bcM), the absorbance change was detected under different concentrations of \u03b1-glucosidase (0.075, 0.1, 0.125, and 0.15 U/mL).\nThe inhibition mode was also detected using a similar method to that described above. In the presence of different concentrations of compounds 3j, 3q and 3t, respectively (0, 25, 30 and 40 \u03bcM), the absorbance change was measured under different concentrations of p-NPG (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 mM). The inhibition mode of the inhibitor was obtianed using Lineweaver-Burk plots. The constant KI was obtained by secondary plots of the derivatives concentration (I) vs. Slope, constant KIS was obtained by secondary plots of the derivatives concentration (I) vs. Intercept."

First, compounds 3d, 3f, and 3i were prepared by energy minimization with the Tripos force field by the Powell gradient algorithm with Gasteiger-H\u00fcckel charges. The\nmaximum iterations for the minimization were set to 10 000. The minimization was terminated when an energy gradient convergence criterion of 0.005 kcal mol\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 was reached. The energy convergence criterion of 0.01 kcal/mol and the maximum iterations for the minimization of 1,000 times were reached. Next, the crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae isomaltase (PDB: 3AJ7) was downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. The protein was prepared by biopolymer and implemented following the procedure of removing water molecules, adding hydrogen atoms, and repairing end residues. The active pocket of protein was generated with the automatic mode. Then the molecular docking of protein with 3d, 3f, and 3i was operated in the default format. The Pymol software was used to draw the view of protein with 3d, 3f, and 3i."
