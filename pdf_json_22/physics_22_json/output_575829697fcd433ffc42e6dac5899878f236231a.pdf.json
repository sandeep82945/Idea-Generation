Thomas, and Michael Virgato\n(Received 13 October 2022; published 30 November 2022)\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.239902\nThe results presented in our published Letter used an incorrect expression for the hadronic form factor. Here we revise Eq. (10) and Figs. 2 and 3 to use the preferred dipole form. The significance of the hadronic form factor suppression is increased, by up to an order of magnitude. The qualitative conclusions of the Letter are unchanged. The replacement for Eq. (10), the relationship between the squared nucleon coupling at zero and finite momentum, is\ncIn\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc cIn\n\u00f01 \u2212 t=Q20\u00de4 ; I \u2208 fS; P; V; A; Tg; \u00f010\u00de\nwhich contains the square of the usual dipole form factor, because cn occurs in the cross section rather than the matrix element. The replacement for Fig. 2 is shown below. We see that as expected, the normalized spectrum of the interaction rate is narrower and peaks towards slightly lower energy transfer. The effect of this additional suppression on the capture rates is shown in Fig. 3. When including the momentum dependence of the neutron couplings, Eq. (10), in the free Fermi gas approach (magenta line), the capture rate for dark matter (DM) of mass m\u03c7 \u2273 1 GeV is now reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude (pseudoscalar operator) for the 1.5 M\u2299 neutron star (NS) (middle column) and more than 3 orders of magnitude for the heaviest NS considered here (compare dashed dark blue with orange lines). When accounting for this correction in the interacting baryon approach (magenta line), we find that the largest suppression of the capture rate\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

(We note that despite DM-nucleon elastic scattering being more suppressed in the large DM mass regime than previously estimated, the deep inelastic scattering contribution to the DM capture rate remains subdominant.)
