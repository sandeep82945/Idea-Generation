    "abstractText": "Randomly diffusing atoms confined in a dissipative optical lattice are illuminated by a weak probe of light. The probe transmission spectrum reveals directed atomic propagation that occurs perpendicular to the direction of probe beam propagation. Resonant enhancement of this directed propagation is observed as we vary the random photon scattering rate. We experimentally characterize this stochastic resonance as a function of probe intensity and lattice well depth. A simple model reveals how the probe-excited atomic density waves and optical pumping rates conspire to create directed atomic propagation within a randomly diffusing sample.",

The probe transmission spectrum reveals directed atomic propagation that occurs perpendicular to the direction of probe beam propagation.

The ability of \u201cBrownian ratchets\u201d to convert random fluctuations into useful directed motion is a central topic in nonequilibrium statistical physics that was carefully explored in theory and experiment [1\u20133]. In particular, the phenomenon of \u201cstochastic resonance,\u201d which refers to a peak in system response as a function of increasing noise strength, has received wide attention in the physics community [4\u20136], even finding application in climate science [7], biology [8], and, more recently, in engineering [9,10]. It was pointed out that naturally occurring protein motors are able to power the processes of life by harnessing energy from surrounding Brownian fluctuations with efficiencies that are orders of magnitude larger than any artificial nanomachine built to date [11]. Thus the notion that the controlled addition of random noise fluctuations may help rather than hinder system performance has important implications for optimizing the efficiency of nanodevices [12] and sensors [13,14] in situations where environmental noise is significant.\nCold atoms confined in dissipative optical potentials [15], where spontaneous emission is significant, are an ideal testbed to study stochastic resonance: The system (i.e., the confining potential) and the random environmental noise (i.e., spontaneous emission recoils, or thermal collisions) can be independently varied by adjusting beam parameters. Recently, in an experiment, stochastic resonances were detected in cold atoms in a dissipative double-well potential formed by splitting a magnetooptical trap with a blue-detuned sheet of light:\n*These authors contributed equally to this work. \u2020Corresponding author: balis@miamioh.edu\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article\u2019s title, journal citation, and DOI.\nRandom thermal collisions caused the atoms to hop between the two wells and stochastic resonances were observed in the interwell hopping rate as a function of temperature, while also varying barrier height and atom number [16].\nIn this work, we report on the observation and experimental characterization of stochastic resonance in the directed propagation of cold atoms confined in a dissipative optical lattice. Here, the transfer between adjacent wells of the periodic potential array is caused by stochastic optical pumping processes. In previous work, stochastic resonance in a dissipative lattice was predicted [17,18], and preliminary evidence was observed by modulating the lattice potential and detecting a resonant enhancement in small center-of-mass displacements of the diffusing atom cloud [19]. In contrast, we reveal stochastic resonance via pump-probe spectroscopy, which permits a first experimental exploration of the dependence of the stochastic resonance on the lattice well depth and the strength of lattice modulation. A new theory [20], based on the decomposition of the current into its atomic density wave contributions, elucidates how probe-modulated ground-state potentials and optical pumping rates conspire to generate resonantly enhanced directed propagation.\nWe consider cold atoms in a so-called three-dimensional (3D)-lin\u22a5lin configuration [15,18], formed by confining the Fg = 1/2 \u2194 Fe = 3/2 atoms in an optical lattice created by the superposition of four red-detuned laser beams of amplitude E0 and frequency \u03c9L. Two beams lie in the plane xOz, with angle \u03b8x, counterpropagating to the other two, which are in the plane yOz with angle \u03b8y, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The beams produce two light-shifted ground-state \u00b11/2-spin potentials U\u00b1(x, y, z) with well depth U0 shown in Fig. 1(b) (see Appendices A and B). We focus on movement along the x-direction. A one-dimensional model arises after neglecting movement in the other perpendicular directions [17\u201319,21]. By formally considering y = z = 0, the optical potential in each ground state is given by [15,18]\nU\u00b1(x) = U0 4 [\u22123 \u2212 cos(2kxx) \u00b1 2 cos(kxx)], (1)\n2643-1564/2022/4(4)/043211(8) 043211-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nwith transition probability rates between them given by\n\u03b3\u00b1(x) = 2 S 9 [3 + cos(2kxx) \u00b1 4 cos(kxx)], (2)\nwhere kx = kL sin \u03b8x, kL is the laser beam wave number, U0 = \u221216h\u0304 \u20320/3, \u20320 (<0) is the light-shift per lattice field, and S is the photon scattering rate per lattice beam. We checked that, within the parameter range studied here, semiclassical simulations [22,23] of the 3D and one-dimensional (1D) systems provide qualitatively equivalent results. In each ground state, atoms oscillate in optical wells with vibrational frequency\nX = kx \u221a\n3U0 2m\n= 4 sin \u03b8x \u221a | \u20320| \u03c9r, (3)\nwhere \u03c9r = h\u0304k2L/(2m) is the recoil frequency. But this motion is not uninterrupted, the interaction with the laser also produces random absorption-emission processes with the excited states (collectively denoted by |e\u3009). Photon scattering is viewed as noise, analogous to Brownian fluctuations in thermal systems, occasionally pumping an atom into the other ground state sublevel at the rate \u03b3\u00b1 (2) and causing spatial diffusion [18,24]. The transitions are most likely at the peaks of the potential barriers, a distance \u03c0/kx from the bottom of the well, yielding the well-known Sisyphus damping, where atoms mostly \u201cclimb hills,\u201d continuously dissipating energy.\nSince the atoms are most likely pumped to a neighboring well via sublevel transitions at the turning points in their oscillations, after half a time period \u03c0/ X , the average velocity associated with this half oscillation is given by vS = X /kx. Once in the new ground-state sublevel, it takes another half a period \u03c0/ X to reach the turning point on the other side of the well, also half a period length \u03c0/kx away. However, with no symmetry breaking element at play, each step can proceed with equal probability to the right or the left, yielding zero current.\nThe introduction of a weak probe Ep, \u03c9p propagating in the z-direction, as in Fig. 1(a), breaks the symmetry resulting in directed motion along \u00b1x: Ep modulates the lattice at \u03b4 = \u03c9L \u2212 \u03c9p producing the following addition to the optical potentials:\nU p\u00b1(x, t ) = \u22122U0\u03b5p cos kxx cos \u03b4t, (4)\nwhere \u03b5p = Ep/4E0. Since cos kxx cos \u03b4t = 12 [cos(\u2212kxx \u2212 \u03b4t ) + cos(+kxx \u2212 \u03b4t )], (5)\nthe probe contribution (4) can be seen as the superposition of two perturbations traveling in opposite directions with velocity \u00b1\u03b4/kx. Each perturbation is expected to excite an atomic density wave with wave number k = \u00b1kx and frequency \u03c9 = \u03b4, referred to as Brillouin modes in analogy to acoustic waves rippling through fluids [17,21]. Optimal propagation is then expected when the velocity of these atomic modes, vB = \u00b1\u03b4/kx, matches that of the half-oscillations discussed above, vS , yielding a maximum at \u03b4 = X . Previous research [17\u201319,21] focused only on these modes, which share the same frequency and wave number as the probe perturbations (a simple visualization is provided in Appendix C). The results of a novel theory [20], presented in Fig. 2, do confirm them as the dominant ones, though other excited density waves can be clearly observed at play with nonnegligible quantitative contributions.\nIn general, a propagating perturbation is expected to excite not only the atomic wave of frequency and wave number of the perturbation, but also other nearby modes. This is indeed the case in our system, Fig. 2 shows that atomic waves with \u03c9 = \u03b4 and k = 2kx and 3kx are also excited, as well as the mode \u03c9 = 2\u03b4, k = 2kx, which has the same phase velocity as the propagating perturbation, in addition to a plethora of nonpropagating modes (i.e., with \u03c9 = 0).\nHowever, mode excitation is not sufficient to guarantee a significant contribution to the directed motion. In Brownian ratchets [1\u20133], the quantity of interest is the current, defined as the average velocity \u3008v\u3009 = limt\u2192\u221e[\u3008x(t )\u3009 \u2212 \u3008x(0)\u3009]/t . A novel theoretical development [20] was able to express analytically the current as an expansion \u3008v\u3009 = \u2211l,n v[l, n],\n043211-2\nwhere v[l, n] is proportional to the Fourier amplitude of the atomic density wave with frequency \u03c9 = l\u03b4 and wave number k = nkx. The analytical calculation is based on the coupled Fokker-Planck equations resulting from the semiclassical approximation [23]. Figure 2 shows the results for the optical lattice (1) to (2) modulated by the +x-propagating part of the probe potential in (4) to (5)\nU p\u00b1(x) = \u2212U0\u03b5p cos(kxx \u2212 \u03b4t ). (6) The good agreement between the current obtained directly in the simulations (diamonds) and the sum of all the mode contributions (dashed line) serves as a validation of the analytical calculations [20].\nAs discussed above, optimal transport for atoms following the density mode \u03c9 = \u03b4, k = kx is expected when its propagation is synchronized with the most likely transitions between the ground-state sublevels, the latter happening at half oscillations in the potential wells, and thus at \u03b4 \u2248 X . Here an atom could be hopping between states after half oscillations while riding at a maximum of the atomic wave. Indeed, the strongest peak observed in Fig. 2 takes place at a frequency slightly below X . The expression used for the vibrational frequency (3) is based on a harmonic approximation for small deviations about the well\u2019s bottoms, actually underestimating the time spent in the half oscillation, and thus, overestimating the optimal frequency.\nA second peak, though of considerably smaller amplitude, can be seen at double this optimal frequency in Fig. 2, indicating a further synchronization mechanism between the two propagation processes. It can be also readily rationalized, as in these conditions, during a half oscillation time, the atomic wave, traveling at two times the previous speed, can still offer a density maximum at the same places where the atomic transitions are most likely, the potential barriers.\nNote that Fig. 2 shows important contributions to the directed motion coming from other modes. In particular, the atomic wave with \u03c9 = \u03b4, k = 2kx is observed to produce a current, slightly less than half the contribution of the probe\u2019s mode, in the opposite direction. In this case the atomic wave is moving with half the speed \u03b4/(2kx ) and has half the wavelength 2\u03c0/(2kx ), thus there is an extra density maximum within the well length 2\u03c0/kx. Under these conditions, an atom moving in the direction of the probe-modulated potential (6) has higher speed than the wave and is less likely to cross a density maximum than when moving in the opposite direction, thus favoring that reversed direction.\nMoreover, Fig. 2 shows that the contribution to the current from the mode with \u03c9 = 0, k = kx is slightly more than half the contribution of the dominant mode, and is therefore relevant. This kind of nonpropagating mode is responsible for directed motion in rocking ratchets [1], where the driving force is usually chosen to be unbiased and nonpropagating. Here the mode, like all modes shown in Fig. 2, is also observed to be optimally excited at about the vibrational frequency, owing to the discussed matching of \u03b4 with the intrinsic frequency X .\nNote that the transition rates \u03b3\u00b1 define another intrinsic frequency of the unperturbed lattice. Taking the spatial average of (2) results in \u03b30 = 2 S/3, the average number of atomic transitions per unit time.\nThus, a resonant enhancement of atoms undergoing directed propagation is expected when \u03b30 is synchronized with \u03b4 and X . Specifically, the most coherent motion is expected when there is a single transition every half oscillation, \u03b30(\u03c0/ X ) \u2248 1, yielding the prediction [18]\nS \u2248 6 \u03c0\nsin \u03b8x \u221a\n| \u20320|\u03c9r . (7) Optimization of the unidirectional propagation is therefore expected when the random photon scattering process S is tuned to the value given by (7). This is stochastic resonance [17\u201319], which we demonstrate experimentally via pumpprobe spectroscopy below.\nOur experiments are performed in a standard 3D tetrahedral lin\u22a5lin lattice, depicted in Fig. 1(a), comprising four equally intense near-resonant red-detuned beams (1/e2diameter, 9.2 mm; \u03b8x = \u03b8y = 25\u25e6) that confine about 108 85Rb atoms (\u223c30 \u00b5K), i.e., only a few percent of the wells are occupied by an atom. We introduce a weak y-polarized z-propagating probe beam (Z-probe) of intensity Ip with 1/e2-diameter 1.4 mm ( diameter of cold atom cloud) at frequency \u03c9p. The lattice beams collectively serve as the pump at fixed frequency \u03c9. The probe frequency \u03c9p is scanned around \u03c9 and probe transmission is measured as a function of the pump-probe detuning \u03b4. The intensity for a single lattice beam I ranges from 1.48 to 14.5 mW/cm2 (total lattice intensity = 4I), and the lattice is red-detuned by = 3.5 \u2212 17 from the 85Rb Fg = 3 \u2192 Fe = 4 D2 transition (natural linewidth /2\u03c0 = 6.07 MHz). In all cases \u03b4/\u03c9 < 10\u22129 and the intensity ratio of probe-to-single lattice beam is |Ep/E0|2 < 4%, i.e., Ip/4I < 1%, or p < 0.05.\nTo explore stochastic resonance we tune the random noise S without changing the optical lattice, described by well depth U0. From (A1) to (A5), we see that if we tune lattice intensity I and detuning such that the ratio I/ remains constant, we may vary S (\u221d I/ 2) without changing U0 (\u221d I/ ).\nFigure 3(a) shows the probe transmission spectrum for a specific lattice well-depth. A spectral feature denoted Z arises because the Z-probe induces Raman transitions between adjacent vibrational levels in each well [21], in this case separated by \u223c \u00b1 170 KHz. The peak (dip) corresponds to photons absorbed from a pump beam (the probe) and emitted into the probe (a pump beam). Further, we observe Brillouin resonances denoted as B which are a signature of directional transport as explained below. Figure 3(b) shows that the observed Z and B values, as the well depth is varied, are in good agreement with the calculated values, shown by lines, for Z (A5) and X (3), respectively.\nThe features B, despite coinciding with \u00b1 X , cannot arise from nonpropagating atoms oscillating inside wells because the Z-probe operator is quadratic in x (Appendix D). Instead, the Z-probe interferes with the lattice beams, producing propagating modulations that drive directed transport. Note that the contributions to the pump-probe spectrum from two of the four lattice beams k3 and k4 are suppressed due to Doppler broadening in the z-direction [25].\nThe interference of the y\u0302-polarized probe with y\u0302-polarized lattice beams k1, k2 (| k1,2| = | kp| = k) generates a propagating intensity modulation in directions \u00b1x (4) and (5). As\n043211-3\ndiscussed above, optimal directed propagation is expected at \u03b4 = \u00b1 X , precisely the features marked B in Fig. 3(a). This velocity class, instead of diffusing in all directions, is ratcheted along \u00b1x, yielding a bidirectional ratchet.\nIn a significant departure from previous works, we shift attention from the location of the peak B to the peak-amplitude A which is proportional to the number of atoms ratcheted along \u00b1x. Figures 4 and 5 show measurements of A in the probe-modulated 3D lattice as a function of the stochastic noise rate S . Each data point is an average A-value measured from at least five scans similar to Fig. 3(a) (see inset of Fig. 4), using a curve-fitting procedure (Appendix E). If the number of atoms initially confined in the lattice is kept the same (within 7% in our case), and I/ is held constant as we vary S , the A-values are a measure of the directed atomic current for different noise rates.\nFigure 4 shows clear evidence for stochastic resonance in a modulated cold atom optical lattice for three probe modulation strengths Ip/4I ranging from 0.25% to 0.85%. Increasing the modulation strength results in larger atomic current, but since the lattice, and therefore vibrational frequency, remains unchanged we observe stochastic resonance at the same S-\nvalue. Atomic transport in this bidirectional ratchet falls off on either side of stochastic resonance, faster for low S-values since well-to-well transfer is disrupted more effectively if optical pumping simply does not occur. These observations concur with numerical simulations in [18] of the diffusion coefficient predicting enhanced transport along \u00b1x.\nFurthermore, the noise rate at which stochastic resonance occurs is seen in Fig. 4 to be in very good agreement with the prediction of (7). This agreement is remarkable considering that the prediction uses a Fg = 1/2 \u2192 Fe = 3/2 atom. In Fig. 5 we test the theory further by fixing the modulation strength and investigating stochastic resonance for several different well depths. In the inset we denote the noise rate at which stochastic resonance occurs as ( S )SR, and experimentally verify the linear dependence of ( S )SR on the square root of the light shift \u20320. The requirement to keep the modulation strength fixed while varying well depth (\u221d I) means that at the highest well depth the probe intensity is strong enough to perturb the lattice, while at the lowest well depth Ip is weak and barely excites Brillouin propagation, causing the data to depart from theory in both cases.\n043211-4\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated stochastic resonance in a modulated dissipative optical lattice, as a function of the noise rate, the modulation amplitude, and the lattice well depth. By observing the transmission spectrum of a weak probe beam that modulates the lattice we present evidence that the photon scattering rate at which stochastic resonance occurs is independent of the modulation strength and that the stochastic resonance can be controlled by varying the lattice well depth. Remarkably, the data agree well with theory based on a simple Fg = 1/2 \u2192 Fe = 3/2 atom without use of any fitting parameters. Furthermore, a recent novel theory permitted us to precisely determine the contribution to the directed motion of the atomic density waves excited by the perturbing probe and how they conspired with the optical pumping rates to create resonant directed propagation within a randomly diffusing cold atom cloud. We believe that this work may contribute toward the quest for artificial nanodevices that can operate in noisy environments with high efficiency [12\u201314]. A recent observation of stochastic resonance in quantum tunneling of an electron [26,27] reveals new directions where the source of the random noise is intrinsic quantum fluctuations in the system, instead of fluctuations in the environment.\nThis work is supported by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the U.S. Army Research Office under Grant Number W911NF2110120.

            "text": "Dissipative optical lattices are an ideal testbed for studying stochastic resonance because the stochastic coupling between the system (confined atom) and environment (random fluctuations in energy in the form of photon scattering) can be precisely controlled by varying the laser intensity and detuning, while ensuring that the lattice well depth remains constant. This essential point can be conveyed using wellknown results for a 1D lin\u22a5lin lattice and a Fg = 1/2 \u2192 Fe = 3/2 atom.\nTwo red-detuned laser beams of orthogonal linear polarization but same amplitude and wavelength \u03bb, counterpropagate along the z-axis, yielding constant intensity but with steep polarization gradient of pitch \u03bb/2. The two ground-state magnetic sublevels mFg = \u00b11/2 undergo polarization-dependent AC Stark shifts yielding spatially modulated potential wells which have maximum depth U1 at sites of alternating pure circular polarization. Atoms settle at the bottoms of these wells. Their oscillatory excursions away from sites of pure circular polarization cause optical pumping to adjacent wells on either side, leading to diffusion along \u00b1z.\nIn the weak excitation limit, we obtain the following well-known expressions [15,18,28,29] for the light-shifted bipotential U\u00b1(z):\nU\u00b1(z) = U1 2 [\u22122 \u00b1 cos 2kLz], (A1)\nthe 1D lattice well depth U1:\nU1 = \u22124 3 h\u0304 0 \u2032 = \u22122 3\n( I/Isat 1 + 4 2/ 2 ) h\u0304 \u221d I| | , (A2)\nthe intrawell vibrational frequency V :\nV = 2 \u221a \u03c9r U1/h\u0304 \u221d \u221a I\n| | , (A3)\nand the position-dependent transition probability rates \u03b3\u00b1 between the ground-state potentials\n\u03b3\u00b1(z) = 2 S 9 (1 \u00b1 cos 2kLz), (A4)\nwhere\nS = 2\n( I/Isat 1 + 4 2/ 2 ) \u221d I 2 . (A5)\nHere I is the lattice laser intensity (per beam) and Isat is the saturation intensity (1.67 mW/cm2 for the 85Rb D2 Fg = 3, mFg = \u00b13\u3009 \u2192 |Fe = 4, mFe = \u00b14\u3009 \u03c3\u00b1 cycling transitions), is the lattice laser detuning (<0), /2\u03c0 is the natural linewidth and \u03c9r/2\u03c0 is the recoil frequency (6.07 MHz and 3.86 kHz, respectively, for 85Rb), kL = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, and z is the lattice axis. The relation | | usually applies in practical situations. The ratio (I/Isat )/(1 + 4 2/ 2) is just the saturation parameter s0 which is 1 in the weak excitation limit. In our 3D lattice experiments s0 ranges from about 0.001 to about 0.08. 0\u2032 \u2261 s0/2 is the light-shift per lattice beam for a closed transition having a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient equal to 1, in accordance with notation used in [15,18]. Finally, S \u2261 s0/2 is the photon scattering rate per lattice beam [18].\nFrom equations (A1) to (A5) we see that if we tune I and such that I/ 2 varies but I/| | stays constant, we can tune the stochastic noise given by the photon scattering rate S while keeping the lattice unchanged (because the well depth U1 and vibrational frequency V stay constant). This ability to tune the stochastic noise while leaving the lattice unchanged makes the dissipative lattice a uniquely ideal testbed for investigating stochastic resonance."

            "text": "As discussed in the paper, a new theory [20] for Brillouin propagation in a 1D section of a 3D lattice decomposes the atomic current into the contributions from the different atomic density wave modes excited by the weak probe. For the\ndominant [1,1] mode the atomic density wave propagates at the same velocity as the propagating potential perturbation.\nA depiction, as in Fig. 6, of the [1,1] mode offers instructive insights into how directed atomic propagation may arise within a sample of randomly diffusing atoms. The topmost\n043211-6\nplot shows the unperturbed bipotential U\u00b1(x) from (1) when the probe is off. The gray region marks the sizes of the unperturbed well depths and the dashed vertical line marks the x-location of a particular well. The probe-modulated groundstate potentials, denoted in the figure by U\u00b1, are simply obtained by adding the expressions for U\u00b1(x) in (1) and U p\u00b1(x, t ) in (4). We use p = Ep/4E0 = 0.1, the same as in Fig. 2. This value of p is more than twice the maximum value attained in our experiments and is used to exaggerate probe effects in Fig. 6 for visual clarity. As indicated in (5), the probe contributes two equal and opposite perturbations traveling in the \u00b1x-directions. The result is that the x-location of the wells stay fixed, but the depths of adjacent wells oscillate out-of-phase with each other. This is illustrated in Figs. 6(a) to 6(i), where successive snapshots of the probe-modulated potentials U\u00b1 are plotted at \u03b4t = 0, \u03c0/4, \u03c0/2 and so on. Note that during the first half of the probe modulation cycle \u03b4t = 0 \u2192 \u03c0 [Figs. 6(a) to 6(e)], U\u2212 becomes shallower while U+ grows deeper, and the roles are reversed during the second half \u03b4t = \u03c0 \u2192 2\u03c0 [Figs. 6(e) to 6(i)].\nThe vibrational frequency X coincides with the modulation frequency \u03b4 for the [1,1] mode. Atoms residing near the bottoms of wells are excited by this resonance, causing them to approach regions near the top of the wells where the probability for a transition to the adjacent well by optical pumping is larger. Consider an atom starting at the top of a U\u2212 well, at \u03b4t = 0 when the well is deepest, on the left side as shown and moving with average velocity +vS = X /kx. Because \u03b4 = X , the atom completes one half-oscillation in the well in the same time \u03b4t = \u03c0 that the modulation completes one half-cycle. A key point is that the well is on the average deeper while the atom is rolling downhill and shallower while rolling uphill. In Fig. 6, the white arrows depict the size and direction of the force at each instant on the atom (not the direction of motion of the atom; this atom is always moving to the right). This asymmetry results in a net force forward on the atom during its half-oscillation, which suppresses the effect of the ever-present frictional force due to Sisyphus cooling. The atom is thus able to reach the top of the well on the other side, triggering a transition to the adjacent well U+, which at \u03b4t = \u03c0 , happens to be at its deepest and the cycle repeats. The atom can undergo directed propagation in the +x-direction over many successive wells [17\u201319,21]. Of course, an atom starting at the top right of a U\u2212 well, at \u03b4t = 0 when the well is deepest, and moving with average velocity \u2212vS , experiences exactly the same type of directed propagation over many wells in the \u2212x-direction. Thus, we have a bidirectional ratchet."

Since the probe Ep is weak, the dominant probe term in the total electric field is the lattice-probe interference term which goes as E0 \u00b7 E\u2217p (see Appendix B). The Raman transition is proportional to the overlap integral \u222b d r \u03c6\u2217n+1 E0 \u00b7 E\u2217p \u03c6n. The product of the wave functions is always odd, therefore this integral is nonzero only if the interference term is odd. For the y-polarized Z-probe, the interference term goes as cos(k x sin \u03b8x ) exp[\u2212ik z(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8x )], which for small values of x and z is linear in z, but quadratic in x (we have taken kL = kp = k). Thus, the integrand of the overlap integral is even in z allowing for the detection of Raman transitions at Z in Fig. 3(a). However, the observed peak-dip features at X in Fig. 3(a) cannot arise from Raman transitions between adjacent vibrational levels because the integrand is an odd function in x. We explain in the paper that these spectral features arise from directional propagating modes along \u00b1x."

I (\u03b4) also contains Lorentzian and dispersive curves to help fit the central feature of the spectrum, referred to as the \u201cRayleigh\u201d feature in the literature [15], believed to arise from atomic velocity damping due to Sisyphus cooling [30].
