    "abstractText": "The interlocking director network can not only help achieve low-cost information sharing and exchange learning among enterprises, but also provide essential resource support for corporate risk-taking behavior. This study aims to empirically analyze the impact, mechanism of action, and boundary of influence of interlocking director network (NET) on corporate risk-taking (RISK) using data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2007 to 2020.The results show: (1) There is a significant positive correlation between NET and RISK, and the above results are still established after a series of robustness tests. (2) Mechanistic tests show that the NET can promote RISK through two channels: alleviating financing constraints and increasing R&D investment. (3) Further analysis reveals the promotion of NET on RISK is more significant in non-state-owned enterprises and enterprises with higher industry competition intensity. These findings have positive implications for the construction of an inter-enterprise interlocking director network and the enhancement the of the risk-taking level.",

This study aims to empirically analyze the impact, mechanism of action, and boundary of influence of interlocking director network (NET) on corporate risk-taking (RISK) using data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2007 to 2020.The results show: (1) There is a significant positive correlation between NET and RISK, and the above results are still established after a series of robustness tests. (2) Mechanistic tests show that the NET can promote RISK through two channels: alleviating financing constraints and increasing R&D investment. (3) Further analysis reveals the promotion of NET on RISK is more significant in non-state-owned enterprises and enterprises with higher industry competition intensity. These findings have positive implications for the construction of an inter-enterprise interlocking director network and the enhancement the of the risk-taking level.\nKEYWORDS\ninterlocking director network, corporate risk-taking, financing constraints, R&D investment, industry competition intensity\n1. Introduction\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and the increasingly fierce global competition have brought unprecedented risks and challenges to the development of Chinese enterprises. In such an economic situation, enterprises must appropriately improve their level of risk-taking if they want to maintain competitive advantage and achieve long-term sustainable economic growth (Tran, 2019). Corporate risk-taking indicates the preference of enterprises for high-risk and highreturn projects in the investment process, reflecting the analysis and selection of investment projects that can generate expected returns and cash flows but are fraught with uncertainty factors by enterprise managers (Min et\u00a0al., 2015). The higher the level of corporate risk-taking, the more the enterprise tends to invest in high-risk, high net present value projects (Chong et\u00a0al., 2018). As high-risk projects tend to generate higher expected returns than low-risk projects, a reasonable level of corporate risk-taking is an important reference for maintaining long-term competitiveness and increasing the long-term value of enterprises. A considerable amount of research has shown that the level of corporate risk-taking is one of the fundamental forces that"

From the microcosmic view, higher risktaking helps enterprises obtain more profits and wealth, maintain long-term competitive advantage, and improve the value and capital allocation efficiency of enterprises (Li et\u00a0 al., 2021). From the macroscopic view, corporate risk-taking is conducive to promoting technological progress, accelerating social capital accumulation, upgrading industrial structure and improving social productivity (Habib and Hasan, 2017). However, some scholars have attributed the root causes of the United\u00a0States financial crisis to excessive risk-taking, arguing that excessive risk-taking can lead to more serious economic consequences (Xiaorong and Ruijun, 2014).\nAs an important informal institutional arrangement, the network relationships embedded in social networks have built a channel for enterprises to share scarce resources and exchange heterogeneous information. In recent years, research on social networks has received increasing attention in the field of organizational psychology. Traditional organizational psychology research has focused on the attributes of actors in organizations in isolation, i.e., the capabilities and characteristics of actors. In contrast, contemporary scholars focus on the relationships among actors in organizations, i.e., how actors use relational network opportunities to gain appropriate social capital, which in turn ultimately influences the organization\u2019s own behavior and decisions (Brass, 2012). Corporate risk-taking has a strong resource dependence, which is not only influenced by the subjective willingness of decision-makers to take risks, but also by the objective limitations on the enterprise\u2019s ability to access resources (Ferris et\u00a0al., 2019). In addition, high-risk projects often require more start-up capital, and the ability of enterprises to access external resources and the level of financing constraints they face can affect the attitude of their managers toward risk. Relevant psychological studies point out that social capital plays an important role in influencing the behavior and decisions of firms (Lazarova and Taylor, 2009). Given that social capital embedded in social networks can provide the necessary resources to support corporate risk-taking, this paper focuses on the impact of social networks in the form of interlocking directors on corporate risk-taking by studying the following questions: (i) Can NET significantly improve RISK? (ii) Through what channels does NET play a role in RISK? (iii) Is there any difference in the impact of NET on RISK for enterprises with different ownership nature and industry competition intensity?\nIn order to answer the above questions, based on the network embeddedness perspective and using the data of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2007 to 2020 as a sample to construct the interlocking director network of listed companies, in this study, we\u00a0systematically examine the influence of network centrality indicators and structural hole richness of NET on RISK. It is found that NET can indeed significantly enhance RISK, and the higher the network centrality and the richer the structural holes, the higher the level of RISK. Financing constraints and R&D investment play a mediating role in the process of NET influencing RISK. The NET can enhance RISK: by alleviating financing constraints and increasing R&D investment. Further subdividing the nature of corporate ownership and the intensity of industry competition, it is found that the promotion effect of NET on RISK is more significant in non-state-owned firms and firms with higher industry competition intensity.\nCompared with the existing literature, the main innovations and contributions of this paper mainly lie in three aspects. First, it expands\nthe research perspective on the economic consequences of interlocking director network and the influencing factors of corporate risk-taking. Current research has focused on the influence of interlocking director network on enterprise innovation (Chuluun et\u00a0al., 2017; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2020), enterprise strategic decision-making (Deutsch et\u00a0al., 2011; Zou et\u00a0al., 2019), enterprise value (Larcker et\u00a0al., 2013; Zona et\u00a0al., 2018) and corporate social responsibility (Xiaoqing et\u00a0al., 2020), and less attention has been paid to the important role played by interlocking director network, an informal social network relationship, in corporate risk-taking. In addition, most of the literature on the influencing factors of corporate risk-taking is based on the principal-agent theory framework, and scholars have studied the impact of enterprise characteristics (Peltom\u00e4ki et\u00a0al., 2021), corporate governance (Nakano and Nguyen, 2012; Sila et\u00a0al., 2016; Gopalan et\u00a0al., 2021), managers\u2019 characteristics (Zhu and Chen, 2015; Ferris et\u00a0al., 2019) and relevant systems and policies (Li et\u00a0al., 2013; Langenmayr and Lester, 2018) on corporate risk-taking from the micro-level and external macroenvironment. This paper, however, takes a new perspective of social network embeddedness and uses network centrality and structural hole richness indicators to study the impact of NET on RISK, extending the research perspective on the influencing factors of corporate risk-taking. Second, compared with Su and Liu\u2019s study, this paper further analyses and tests the influence mechanism of NET on RISK by introducing two mediating variables, namely financing constraints and R&D investment, which makes the influence channel of NET on RISK clearer and more complete, and provides some theoretical reference and empirical basis for promoting the improvement of corporate risk-taking under the background of economic transformation (Su and Liu, 2019). Third, the ability of enterprises to access resources varies across different nature and competitive environments. Therefore, based on Su and Liu\u2019s research, this paper further reveals the boundary conditions of the influence of NET on RISK from the perspective of the nature of the ownership and the intensity of industry competition, which is helpful for enterprises to take appropriate risk investment behavior in the face of the complex and changeable market competition environment."

            "text": "According to resource dependency theory, an important element of corporate risk-taking is access to abundant scarce resources and critical information (Zona et\u00a0al., 2018). Previous studies have shown that the social network of enterprises is beneficial for enterprises to obtain relevant knowledge, experience and information resources required for risk-taking behavior (Dbouk et\u00a0al., 2020). As an important social network relationship, the interlocking director network is a direct or indirect inter-enterprise network established by directors who serve on the boards of two or more enterprises at the same time through cross-servicing (Bianchi et\u00a0 al., 2020). At present, most scholars describe the position of enterprises in the network from two aspects: centrality and structural holes. \u201cCentrality\u201d mainly describes whether an enterprise is near the center or the edge of the network. The \u201cstructural hole\u201d is a bridge for two enterprises that have no direct connection. Because the position of enterprises in the network is an\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nimportant factor determining their ability to obtain resources, this study mainly uses centrality and structural holes to explain the impact of NET on RISK. Interlocking directors establish a connection between the internal organization and the external market environment by serving on the boards of multiple corporations, which provides enterprises with rich heterogeneous resources and an important channel for information sharing (Deren and Yunsen, 2012). Based on the existing literature, the influence of NET on RISK is mainly reflected in the governance effect and resource effect.\nIn terms of governance effect, the existence of agency problems will reduce the level of RISK. For the sake of self-interest, managers are more likely to adopt a relatively stable investment strategy to avoid personal wealth loss, dismissal risk and professional reputation loss caused by investment failure (John et\u00a0 al., 2008). The interlocking director network can influence the ability of corporate risk-taking through the function of the board of directors. On the one hand, interlocking directors can use their central position in the network to gain more information, resources and knowledge of governance behavior, which can enhance their decision-making influence on the board of directors and accumulate more personal reputation capital for them (Larcker et\u00a0al., 2013). This reputation capital will strengthen their supervision effect and make them more motivated and stricter to restrain and supervise the self-interest and rent-seeking behavior of managers, which further eases the agency conflict of enterprises. When the agency conflict is alleviated, enterprise managers are more willing to invest in venture capital projects that contribute to corporate growth and have a positive net present value to enhance the level of RISK. On the other hand, interlocking directors at the center of the network and occupying the position of structural holes can provide enterprises with more abundant and diversified information resources. These heterogeneous information resources are conducive to enhancing directors\u2019 right to advise on company management decisions, and help managers make more informed risk investment decisions (Chao and Jianjun, 2018). Relevant psychological research shows that enterprises can gain social capital such as knowledge and experience by observing and emulating the superior strategic behavior of partners in the network, which helps them make better decisions (Xie et\u00a0al., 2020; Tian et\u00a0al., 2021).\nIn terms of resource effect, risk-taking is a resource-consuming activity (Ferris et\u00a0 al., 2019). The social capital and information channels brought by the interlocking director network can alleviate the dependence of corporate risk-taking behavior on external resources and help improve the level of risk-taking. First, as an informal institutional arrangement, the interlocking director network has the advantages of low connection cost, stable connection and effective connection, which can help companies obtain more resources at a lower cost (Larcker et\u00a0 al., 2013). Specifically, the higher the centrality of the interlocking director network of a company, the more relationships it establishes with other companies, the shorter the transmission path of information and resources, and the faster the company has access to core resources and effective information. In addition, enterprises occupying structural holes function as information dissemination \u201cbridges\u201d in the network, which can connect enterprises that are not directly connected to access heterogeneous resources and key information needed for risk-taking behavior (Tortoriello, 2015). Second, the root of the resource constraint problem faced by enterprises lies in the information asymmetry among enterprises. Enterprise relationship network\nembedding can accelerate the rapid transmission and flow of information among enterprises, increase the frequency of information communication and resource-sharing opportunities, reduce the information asymmetry in the investment process and create more venture capital projects and strategic implementation platforms for enterprises. Accordingly, Hypothesis 1 is proposed:\nH1: Interlocking director network is positively related to corporate risk-taking. The higher the centrality or the richer the structural holes, the higher the level of risk-taking."

            "text": "As an important factor restricting the development of enterprises, financing constraints have been the focus of academic research. Studies have shown that the interlocking director network can alleviate the financing constraints of enterprises through the advantage of network location (Xiaoqing et\u00a0 al., 2020). For one thing, the embedding of the interlocking director network relationship provides information channels for enterprises to communicate with the outside world, which can alleviate the information asymmetry between enterprises and fund providers, help enterprises obtain more external funds and financing channels at a lower cost, and reduce the difficulty of external financing. Wang et\u00a0al. (Ying and Tingqiu, 2014) found the embedding of the director network is beneficial to increase the ability of enterprises to obtain debt financing. The higher the network centrality of the enterprise, the more access to debt resources and information, and the lower the cost of debt financing. The work of Chuluun et\u00a0al. (2014) suggested that the information transmission function of the director network is beneficial in reducing the financing constraints arising from information asymmetry between the enterprise and external creditors. For another, the interlocking director network can also affect the efficiency of corporate governance. Gertler (1989) pointed out that agency problems will affect the level of corporate financing constraints. The social capital and reputation capital brought by the interlocking director network to the enterprise can reduce management\u2019s agency problems, improve corporate governance efficiency and alleviate the financing constraints of the enterprise.\nThe venture capital projects of enterprises are characterized by long investment cycles, large capital investments and many uncertainties, which means that enterprises need sufficient resources to support the investment process. However, the financing constraints faced by enterprises in the investment process will restrict the ability of enterprises to obtain resources and reduce the level of corporate risk-taking. Yan et\u00a0al. (Ruosen et\u00a0al., 2020) found that enterprises with higher financing constraints will tend to avoid high-risk investment projects in order to increase the success rate of loans, which will reduce corporate risk-taking. However, enterprises can use their location advantage in the social network to access resources and alleviate financing constraints. Enterprises with higher network centrality and richer structural holes will have a stronger ability to access information and resources (Xiaoqing et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, the interlocking director network of enterprises can help enterprises obtain the resources required for venture capital investment at a lower\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE\u00a01 Research framework.\nfinancing cost and improve the level of corporate risk-taking. On this basis, Hypothesis 2 is proposed:\nH2: Financing constraints play a mediating role in the relationship between NET and RISK. The NET can improve RISK by reducing financing constraints."

            "text": "Corporate R&D activities are a high-risk, high-return strategic behavior with high requirements for innovative resources and information. Resource allocation and R&D decisions of enterprises are often decided by the board of directors, in which interlocking directors play an important role in this process. Interlocking directors are a reliable and low-cost network of inter-enterprise relationships where enterprises can exchange resources and share information to obtain the resources and information flow needed for R&D activities (Jiang et\u00a0al., 2020). Network centrality and structural holes are key indicators to measure the network position of interlocking directors. Compared with enterprises at the edge of the network, enterprises occupying the central position of the network are more likely to obtain new information and new resources related to R&D activities (Ying and guangli, 2018). These new information and resources help to promote technology exchange among enterprises, reduce the cost of trial-and-error and investment risks of enterprise innovation and R&D, and increase the motivation of enterprise R&D investment. Generally speaking, enterprises in the structural hole position possess a large amount of heterogeneous information and resources, which can be\u00a0 integrated and utilized to increase the motivation for enterprises to invest in R&D.\nThe R&D investment of enterprises is strongly related to the level of risk-taking (Dewett, 2007). In general, enterprises with more R & D investment have a stronger risk appetite. Banerjee and Gupta (2019) found that the R&D investment of enterprises will significantly promote the level of risk-taking. Therefore, it is important for enterprises to appropriately increase their risk-taking level once they are involved in investment decisions related to R&D projects. However, the R&D investment of enterprises is an investment with high risk, long cycle, and uncertain return. Only when enterprises obtain new resources and information from the outside for a long time\ncan they ensure the smooth progress of R&D projects (Ying and guangli, 2018). The key technical resources and rich technical experience brought by the interlocking director network are conducive to prompting managers to increase the R&D investment intensity of enterprise innovation activities and enhance the level of risk-taking. Therefore, hypothesis 3 is proposed:\nH3: R&D investment plays a mediating role in the relationship between NET and RISK. The NET can improve RISK by increasing corporate R&D investment.\nIn summary, the overall research framework of this paper is shown in Figure\u00a01."

To eliminate the effects of industry and economic cycles, we\u00a0calculated the standard deviation (RISK1) and extreme deviation (RISK2) of return on assets adjusted by the industry and annual average to measure RISK, respectively.

The specific calculation process of corporate risk-taking can be\u00a0seen in the following equation:\nAdj Roa\nEBIT\nASSET\nEBIT\nASSET _ .,\n,\n,\n,\n, i t\ni t\ni t k\nX k t\nk tX = \u2212 = \u22111 1\n(1)\n2\n, , , 1 1 1 1RISK1 Adj_ Roa Adj_ Roa 3 1 = =   = \u2212 =  \u2212   \u2211 \u2211 T T i t i t i t t t T T T (2)\nRISK Adj Roa Adj Roa2i t i t i t, , ,max _ min _= ( ) \u2212 ( ) (3)\nwhereAdj Roa_ ,i t represents the return on assets adjusted by the industry and annual average; EBIT is the profit before interest and tax; ASSET is the total assets at the end of the year; the subscripts i indicates the company and t indicates the year; X and k respectively represent the total number of enterprises in a certain industry and the k-th enterprise in the industry; T = 3 represents a 3-year observation period."

            "text": "The independent variables in this study are the centrality and structural holes of NET. Network centrality focuses on the selfdirected connected nature of a company, and to some extent reflects the importance and influence of that company in the overall network. Previous studies mostly used three indicators: degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality. However, the closeness centrality has higher requirements on the network, and it can only be\u00a0done when the network is completely connected, so this indicator is rarely used. Therefore, drawing on the methods of Xie and Chen (Deren and Yunsen, 2012), we\u00a0adopted two indicators, degree centrality (Degree) and betweenness centrality (Betweenness), to\nmeasure the centrality of interlocking directors of listed companies in the overall network. The calculation formula is shown below:\nDegreei\nj i ijX\ng = \u2212 \u2260\u2211 1\n(4)\nwhere i is the focal company and j is other companies other than i in that year; Xij is a network connection, if company i and j have at least one interlocking director, the Xij =1 , or else Xij = 0 ; g is the total number of companies in the network, and due to the year difference, g \u2212( )1 is used in this paper to eliminate the effect of the network size difference.\nBetweennessi\nj k jk n jkg g g g i = \u2212( ) \u2212( ) < ( )\u2211 / /1 2 2\n(5)\nwhere g jk is the number of shortest paths between company j and k ; g jk ni( ) is the number of shortest paths between company j and k , and through company i ; g is the number of companies in the interlocking director network, and g g\u2212( ) \u2212( )1 2 2/ is used to eliminate the effect of the network size difference of listed companies.\nDifferent from network centrality, structural holes focus more on the non-redundant connections between two actors. As shown in Figure\u00a02A, four independent individual actors A, B, C, and O have direct connections (represented by solid lines) between them, and each actor has the same positional advantage in the network and the same access to resources and information, so there is no structural hole in this network. However, in contrast, see Figure\u00a02B, there is no direct connection between the three actors A, B, and C (indicated by dashed lines), but there is a direct connection between actor O and A, B, and C. At this time, O becomes the only channel for communication among A, B, and C. The flow direction of information and resources in the network is controlled by O, and O occupies the structural hole position in the whole network.\nThe calculation methods of the structural hole index include effective size, efficiency, constraint and hierarchy, among which the constraint index is more widely used. Following the study of Tortoriello (2015), this paper measured the richness of the structural holes (SH) of the interlocking director network by the difference between 1 and Constraint. SH is calculated as follows:\nSHi ij q iq qjP P P q i j= \u2212 +\n   \n    \u2260\u22111 2 , ,\n(6)\nwhere Pij represents the direct connection strength between company i and company j ; \u2211 iq qj\nq P P is the sum of the strength of\nthe indirect connection between company i and company j where\npassing through company q is the only way; P P Pij q iq qj+\n   \n\n  \u2211\n2\nrepresents the degree to which company i is constrained by company j . The larger the SH, the richer the structure holes of the interlocking director network.\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org"

Specifically, following Zhou et\u00a0 al.\u2019s study (Xuefeng et\u00a0al., 2021), the sample was divided into two groups based on the median of the centrality and structural holes representing the interlocking director network position, with the higher network position being the treatment group and the lower network position being the control group, and matched according to the 1:1 nearest neighbor matching method, with the matching variables containing all the control variables in Model 1. The matched sample was tested again and found that, after controlling for endogeneity caused by sample selectivity bias, interlocking director network position was still significantly and positively correlated with corporate risk-taking, again providing a robustness check for the previous findings (results omitted due to space constraints)."

Because of the difference in ownership, there is a significant difference in the ability to access resources between state-owned and private enterprises. Compared to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), non-SOEs are smaller, subject to a higher degree of financing constraints, have a greater need for resources, and therefore have a greater need to access resources by resorting to the informal system of interlocking director network. SOEs, although they are more likely to obtain resources for risktaking behavior through the interlocking director network, also tend to adopt a more prudent investment strategy due to their more severe government intervention. Therefore, this paper argues that the nature of ownership will weaken the positive effect of NET on RISK.\nTo test whether the above analysis is true, following the method of Li et\u00a0al. (Wenggui and Minggui, 2012), this study groups the nature of ownership (SOE) of the sample enterprises according to the nature of the ultimate controller. If the final controller of the enterprise is a state-owned entity, it is a state-owned enterprise (SOE = 1), or else SOE = 0. The grouping regressions are shown in Table\u00a09. Columns (1)\u2013 (3) are the regression results for the state-owned enterprises group, and columns (4)\u2013(6) are the regression results for the non-SOEs group.

            "text": "Based on the social network embeddedness perspective, this paper selects Chinese A-listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2007 to 2020 as the research sample to empirically examine the influence mechanism of NET on RISK. Consistent with previous studies (Larcker et\u00a0 al., 2013; Min et\u00a0 al., 2015), we\u00a0find that NET does significantly improve the level of RISK, and this finding still holds after robustness tests using the instrumental variables method, changing the regression model and replacing the dependent variable. In terms of the influence mechanism, the NET enhance RISK by reducing SA and increasing R&D. Further discussion reveals that the effect of NET on RISK is more pronounced in non-SOEs and enterprises with high industry competition than in SOEs and enterprises with low industry competition.\nThe research in this paper provides the following insights into the construction of inter-enterprise interlocking director network and the enhancement of risk-taking level: (1) Listed companies should pay attention to the construction of interlocking director network and make full use of their unique \u201cresource effect\u201d and \u201cgovernance effect\u201d to help companies obtain external resources and network information required for risk-taking and further enhance corporate risk-taking level. (2) The government and relevant departments should encourage and guide enterprises to build a reasonable interlocking director network system and further optimize its resource allocation function to alleviate the financing constraints faced by enterprises and promote their R&D investment intensity. (3) Due to the fact that the function of interlocking director network is more significant in non-SOEs and enterprises with high industry competition. Therefore, enterprises should also reasonably select and use the interlocking director network according to their own situation and the external market competition environment they are in.\nStill, our study has certain limitations on which further research will be\u00a0 explored. First, we\u00a0 failed to comprehensively consider the differences in the role of different types of interlocking director networks. Interlocking directors can be\u00a0 divided into independent directors and non-independent directors, and the impact of the two on corporate risk-taking may differ. Future research can further subdivide the interlocking director network into independent director network and non-independent director network for comparative research. Second, this study lacks further exploration of the intrinsic relationship between the two. The interlocking director network may not only improve corporate risk-taking through the two channels of reducing financing constraints and increasing R&D\ninvestment, but there may also be\u00a0other paths of action between the two. We\u00a0 will further explore the influence mechanism between the two in the future. Third, we\u00a0 did not verify the differential effects of other types of social networks on corporate risk-taking. There are various ways of forming social network relationships among firms, but in this paper, we\u00a0only considered interlocking director network relationships embedded among firms. Future research can examine the impact of multiple types of social networks on corporate risk-taking. Fourth, the research conclusions of this paper are based on the \u201cstatic\u201d basis, without considering the impact and mechanism of NET on RISK under the dynamic situation. In future research, we\u00a0 can establish a dynamic model to break the bottleneck of horizontal comparison and make the research results more consistent with the actual situation."
