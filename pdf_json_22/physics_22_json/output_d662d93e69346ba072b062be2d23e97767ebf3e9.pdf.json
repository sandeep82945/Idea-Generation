    "abstractText": "The total and differential cross sections of high-energy pion-proton and pion-pion scattering are investigated in a holographic QCD model, focusing on the Regge regime in which the Pomeron exchange gives the dominant contribution to those cross sections. The Pomeron is described by the Reggeized spin-2 particle propagator, and the hadron-Pomeron couplings are given by gravitational form factors of the hadrons, which are obtained from the bottom-up AdS/QCD models. Since the parameters, which characterize the Pomeron trajectory, have been determined in a preceding study of the proton-proton scattering, the pion-proton cross sections can be expressed with a single adjustable parameter. Once this parameter is determined by the experimental data of the pion-proton total cross section, its differential cross section and the pion-pion cross sections can be calculated without any additional parameter. Although the currently available data are limited, it is found that our calculation is consistent with those. Our predictions are explicitly shown, and the present model can be tested at the future experimental facilities.",

INTRODUCTION\nHigh-energy hadron-hadron scattering has been one of the most important research topics in high energy physics over several decades, since its cross sections reflect the internal structure of the involved hadrons. In particular, the proton-proton scattering has been intensively studied, and for instance, the recent experimental data for the high-energy elastic scattering measured by the TOTEM Collaboration at the LHC [1\u20136] have provided us with the valuable opportunities to deepen our understandings about the proton structure. It is natural to have interest in other hadron-hadron scattering processes which involve other hadrons. In this work, we focus on the pion involved processes, the elastic pion-proton and pion-pion scattering in the Regge regime. Various preceding studies have\nbeen presented in Refs. [7\u201311]. The pion is the lightest Nambu-Goldstone boson, and it is important to understand its structure to improve our knowledge of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We investigate the total and differential cross sections, and discuss the differences between those processes and the proton-proton case. Elastic hadron-hadron scattering is a simple two-body process, and its cross sections shall be described by QCD. Historically, the scaling laws for the differential cross sections at s \u2192 \u221e and fixed t=s, where s and t are the Mandelstam variables, were investigated in Refs. [12\u201314]. However, especially for the high-energy forward scattering, the cross sections are determined by quite complicated gluonic interactions, and practically it is impossible to calculate those by the perturbative technique of QCD. Hence, it is required to build a model, which appropriately approximates such a nonperturbative interaction and enables one to predict the cross sections in broad kinematic regions. It is known that the Reggeon and Pomeron exchange can give a reasonable description for the cross sections. Donnachie and Landshoff showed that by this combination various hadron-hadron total cross section data can be well described [15]. At high energies, the Pomeron exchange, which can be interpreted as a multi-gluon exchange, gives the dominant contribution to the cross sections. The leading Pomeron trajectory with its intercept \u03b1\u00f00\u00de \u2248 1 but slightly greater than 1, which is the so-called soft Pomeron intercept, can describe the growing behavior of the total hadronic cross sections. *Corresponding author. watanabe@ctgu.edu.cn \u2020xiewei@ctgu.edu.cn \u2021sunfei@ctgu.edu.cn \u00a7lish@ctgu.edu.cn \u2225202107020021014@ctgu.edu.cn Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The holographic QCD models are constructed based on the AdS=CFT correspondence [24\u201326], and have been applied to a lot of studies of high-energy scattering processes so far [27\u201348]. We extend the work presented in Ref. [45], in which the elastic proton-proton scattering was studied in a holographic QCD model, and investigate the pion-proton and pion-pion scattering, focusing on the Regge regime. In our model, the Pomeron is described by the Reggeized spin-2 particle propagator, and the proton-Pomeron and pionPomeron couplings are given by gravitational form factors of the proton and pion, which can be obtained from the bottom-up AdS/QCD models [49,50]. Combining the propagator and the form factors, we obtain the expressions for the total and differential cross sections, and numerically evaluate them. There are four parameters in our model, but for three of them, one is the proton-Pomeron coupling constant and two characterize the Pomeron trajectory, we use the values determined in Ref. [45] by virtue of the universality of the Pomeron. Hence, the pion-proton cross sections can be expressed with a single adjustable parameter, which controls the magnitudes of them. We determine this parameter by the experimental data of the pion-proton total cross section, and then its differential cross section and the pionpion cross sections can be calculated without any additional parameter. Although the currently available data are limited, it is found that our calculation is consistent with those. We will explicitly show our predictions, and discuss the differences between the pion involved processes and the proton-proton case. The model presented here can be tested at the future experimental facilities. This paper is organized as follows. In the next section we introduce the formalism of our model to describe the high energy pion-proton and pion-pion scattering in the Regge regime. We explain how to obtain the gravitational form factors, which specify the hadron-Pomeron couplings, from the bottom-up AdS/QCD models in Sec. III. Our numerical results for the total and differential cross sections are presented in Sec. IV, and the summary of this work is given in Sec. V."

            "text": "The formalism of holographic description of the protonproton scattering in the Regge regime has been developed in the preceding study [35]. Here we extend it to the pionproton and pion-pion scattering and give the expressions for the cross sections. According to the formalism, the 2\u00fe\u00fe glueball field is expressed as a second-rank symmetric traceless tensor h\u03bc\u03bd, which is assumed to be coupled predominantly to the QCD energy-momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd,\nS \u00bc \u03bb Z d4xh\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere \u03bb is the coupling constant.

For the proton case, the matrix element can be expressed with three gravitational form factors [51],\nhp0; s0jT\u03bc\u03bd\u00f00\u00dejp;si \u00bc u\u0304\u00f0p0; s0\u00de Ap\u00f0t\u00de \u03b3\u03bcP\u03bd \u00fe \u03b3\u03bdP\u03bc 2\n\u00feBp\u00f0t\u00de i\u00f0P\u03bc\u03c3\u03bd\u03c1 \u00feP\u03bd\u03c3\u03bc\u03c1\u00dek\u03c1\n4mp\n\u00feCp\u00f0t\u00de \u00f0k\u03bck\u03bd \u2212 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bdk2\u00de\nmp\nu\u00f0p;s\u00de; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere mp represents the proton mass, k \u00bc p0 \u2212 p, t \u00bc k2, and P \u00bc \u00f0p\u00fe p0\u00de=2. For the pion case, the matrix element of the energymomentum tensor can be written in terms of two gravitational form factors,\nh\u03c0a\u00f0p2\u00dejT\u03bc\u03bd\u00f00\u00dej\u03c0b\u00f0p1\u00dei\n\u00bc \u03b4ab 2A\u03c0\u00f0t\u00dep\u03bcp\u03bd \u00fe\n1 2 C\u03c0\u00f0t\u00de\u00f0k2\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 k\u03bck\u03bd\u00de ; \u00f04\u00de\nwhere p \u00bc \u00f0p1 \u00fe p2\u00de=2, k \u00bc p1 \u2212 p3, and t \u00bc k2. In this study, we focus on the Regge regime, in which the condition s \u226b jtj is satisfied. In the regime, the contributions from terms which involve the form factors, Bp and Cp, can be neglected [35]. Also, it was shown in Ref. [49] that C\u03c0 can be expressed with A\u03c0 . Hence, it is enough to only consider Ap and A\u03c0 in this study. The scattering amplitude for the interested hadronhadron scattering is obtained by combining the Pomeron propagator, which is described by the Reggeized spin-2 particle propagator, and the gravitational form factors of the involved hadrons. Only t-channel scattering is needed to be considered, since it is the dominant channel in the Regge regime. The lowest state on the leading Pomeron trajectory is assumed to be the 2\u00fe\u00fe glueball whose propagator can be written as [52]\nd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4\u00f0k\u00de k2 \u2212m2g ; \u00f05\u00de\n054025-2\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the Lorentz indices contracted at one side, and \u03b3 and \u03b4 are the Lorentz indices contracted at the other side. mg is the glueball mass and d\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 is explicitly expressed as\nd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 \u00bc 1\n2 \u00f0\u03b7\u03b1\u03b3\u03b7\u03b2\u03b4 \u00fe \u03b7\u03b1\u03b4\u03b7\u03b2\u03b3\u00de\n\u2212 1\n2m2g \u00f0k\u03b1k\u03b4\u03b7\u03b2\u03b3 \u00fe k\u03b1k\u03b3\u03b7\u03b2\u03b4 \u00fe k\u03b2k\u03b4\u03b7\u03b1\u03b3 \u00fe k\u03b2k\u03b3\u03b7\u03b1\u03b4\u00de\n\u00fe 1 24\nk2\nm2g\n2 \u2212 3 k2\nm2g\n\u2212 6 \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03b3\u03b4\n\u2212 k2 \u2212 3m2g 6m4g \u00f0k\u03b1k\u03b2\u03b7\u03b3\u03b4 \u00fe k\u03b3k\u03b4\u03b7\u03b1\u03b2\u00de \u00fe 2k\u03b1k\u03b2k\u03b3k\u03b4 3m4g : \u00f06\u00de\nSince we will take the Regge limit in calculation of the scattering amplitude, we can drop the terms which are suppressed by the factor of t=s. Hence only considering the terms in the first line of this equation is actually enough in this study. The above propagator only includes the exchange of the lightest state, i.e., the 2\u00fe\u00fe glueball on the trajectory.

In the present model, there are four parameters in total, \u03b1c\u00f00\u00de, \u03b10c, \u03bb\u03c0, and \u03bbp, which need to be determined by the experimental data. However, the three of those were determined\n054025-6\nin the preceding study of the proton-proton scattering [45], and we can use the resulting values for the pion-proton and pion-pion cases by virtue of the universality of the Pomeron. In Ref. [45], the parameters were determined with all the available data, including the recent TOTEM ones [1\u20136], for the total and differential cross sections at high energies, and it was shown that the model can well describe the data. The parameter values taken from that work are \u03b1c\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1.086, \u03b10c \u00bc 0.377 GeV\u22122, and \u03bbp \u00bc 9.70 GeV\u22121. Hence, the total and differential cross sections of pion-proton and pion-pion scattering are now expressed with a single adjustable parameter \u03bb\u03c0 which describes the pion-Pomeron coupling. We determine the parameter \u03bb\u03c0 by the pion-proton total cross section data summarized by the Particle Data Group (PDG) in 2020 [56]. Since we focus on the Regge regime and only consider the Pomeron exchange in this study, we need to set a kinematic cut to suppress the contributions from the Reggeon exchange. We utilize all the available data that have Plab \u2265 100 GeV=c, which corresponds toffiffi s p \u2265 13.73 GeV, to determine the value of \u03bb\u03c0 . Using Eq. (14) and the MINUIT package [57], the numerical fit is performed, and the best fit value is found to be \u03bb\u03c0 \u00bc 3.950 0.016 GeV\u22121. Once the parameter \u03bb\u03c0 is determined, the pion-pion total cross section can be calculated without any additional parameter, using Eq. (17). The resulting total cross sections are shown in Fig. 4, in which the proton-proton result taken from Ref. [45] is also shown for comparison. Although the number of available experimental data in the considered kinematic region is limited and the data in the TeV scale have huge uncertainties, it can be seen from the figure that our calculation is consistent with those. In the present model, since the parameters which characterize the Pomeron trajectory are common to all the hadron-hadron processes, the total cross section rations are constant. The resulting ratios are found to be\n\u03c3\u03c0ptot \u03c3pptot \u00bc 0.73; \u03c3 \u03c0\u03c0 tot \u03c3pptot \u00bc 0.39: \u00f034\u00de\nUsing Eqs. (13) and (16), and the gravitational form factors specified in Sec. III, the pion-proton and pion-pion differential cross sections can be numerically evaluated. The results are shown in Fig. 5, in which the proton-proton results obtained from the model setup presented in Ref. [45] are also shown for comparison. From the figure, the substantial differences of the t dependence among the three curves can be clearly seen. Comparing to the protonproton case, the t dependence of the pion-proton results is obviously weaker, and that of the pion-pion results is further weaker. This qualitative behavior reflects the substantial t dependence difference between the proton and pion gravitational form factors, and is independent of theffiffi s p values in the considered kinematic regime."

            "text": "We have investigated the elastic pion-proton and pionpion scattering at high energies in a holographic QCD model, focusing on the Regge regime. Considering the Pomeron exchange, which is expressed by the Reggeized spin-2 particle propagator, and specifying the hadronPomeron couplings by the gravitational form factors, which are obtained from the bottom-up AdS/QCD models, we have proposed a novel description of those scattering processes. Since this model is overall constructed within the framework of holographic QCD, this is a consistent description. The notable advantage of the model is the fact that it only includes a single adjustable parameter, since the other three parameters were precisely determined in the preceding study of the proton-proton scattering. We have determined this single parameter by the experimental data of the pion-proton total cross section and shown that our calculation is consistent with those data. Then, we have presented our predictions for the pion-pion total cross section, and the pion-proton and pion-pion differential cross sections, which can be calculated without any additional parameter in the present model. From the differential cross section results, the t dependence differences are clearly seen, which reflect the substantial difference between the proton and pion gravitational form factors. In this study, we have performed the numerical fit with the pion-proton data, and the resulting pion-proton total cross section seems reasonable. However, the number of the currently available data is limited and also the data in the TeV scale have huge uncertainties. It is obvious that the determination of the best fit value was strongly affected by the data in the lower s region. Hence, the absolute magnitudes of the cross sections presented in this paper may have some uncertainties, although it is difficult to estimate those. This is our best effort at this moment, and more data especially in the high s region, where the contributions from the Reggeon exchange are completely suppressed, are required to pin down the absolute magnitudes. Nevertheless, it is interesting that the qualitative differences are found in our resulting differential cross sections. In the present model, the slope depends on the slope parameter of the Pomeron trajectory and the gravitational form factor, and is especially sensitive to the latter one. Therefore, it is expected that future experimental data will help to improve our understandings about the pion structure and also QCD itself."
