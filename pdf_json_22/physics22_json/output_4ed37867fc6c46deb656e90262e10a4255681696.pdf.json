INTRODUCTION\nA star with the initial mass greater than about 8 solar mass develops an iron core where nuclear fusion ceases to take place. As the iron core accumulates mass beyond the Chandrasekhar limit [1,2], it eventually undergoes gravitational collapse, resulting in the formation of a shock wave at the surface of the core (an internal object with a stiff equation of state is called the protoneutron star) and subsequently blows up the outer layers with the help of the delayed partial neutrino energy conduction [3\u20136]. This extraordinary and explosive event is referred to as a type-II supernova. One notable example of a core-collapse supernova is SN1987A, which occurred on February 23, 1987, in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It stands as the only event in which an energetic burst of neutrinos was directly detected. Apart from the ejection of the outer part, a compact object associated with the core may remain in the center. The recent observations of the heated dust clumps at the inferred position (with a kick velocity) from the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter Array [7,8] and the analysis of hard X-ray spectra performed by Chandra, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR [9,10] strongly suggest the presence of a neutron star as the promising remnant of SN1987A. Supernovae provide a valuable testing ground [11] for exploring new light particles beyond the Standard Model (SM) such as axions, dark photons, and other similar particles that are challenging to detect in terrestrial experiments. Indeed, novel particles can be copiously produced in supernova, particularly inside the protoneutron star (pNS), through particle reactions occurring in its dense medium. The interior of the pNS is characterized by high temperature (T \u223c 30 MeV for a few seconds after birth) and extreme density (\u03c1\u2273 \u03c1sat \u2243 2.6 \u00d7 1014 g cm\u22123). In such a neutronrich environment (np=nB \u223c 20% with np and nB the proton and baryon number density, respectively), the production of these new particles is primarily influenced by nucleonnucleon bremsstrahlung mediated by the strong interactions, which has been extensively studied in Refs. [12\u201318]. Recent studies have put forward the idea that, in addition to electrons, other negatively charged particles like muons [19] and pions [20] might constitute a significant fraction (O\u00f01\u00de% ratio to nB) in the pNS. The non-negligible abundance of these particles can be attributed to the high temperature and the hight electron chemical potential, which is determined by the difference between the nucleon chemical potentials (\u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp). For more details, please see Refs. [19,20] and the references therein.

In addition, the scattering of negatively charged particles can make a significant contribution to the production of new particles [21\u201324]. In this study, our focus is on investigating the production of feebly interacting vector bosons associated with a novel Abelian gauge symmetry within supernovae. We specifically examine the mechanism of their production through thermal pion scatterings which exhibit similarities to the Panofsky process [25]. We also explore the implications of these vector bosons on various supernova observations. These light vector bosons are often referred to as a dark gauge bosons [26\u201330] denoted by \u03b30 or A0\u03bc. In comparison to the more commonly considered nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung [17], pionic processes yield dark gauge bosons with a comparable emission rate, but they possess an one order of magnitude larger energy due to the thermal pion energy threshold (including its mass), similar to the case of axions [21\u201323]. The significant emissivity and harder energy spectrum of these bosons have remarkable implications for observations associated with supernovae such as the duration of the observed signal from SN1987A, observations of supernova explosion energy, the estimated injection rate of positrons in the galaxy as a source of diffuse gamma-ray emission, and the absence of prompt gamma-rays in SN1987A. These implications eventually lead to stringent constraints on models involving dark gauge bosons, particularly for masses above two times the electron mass, as they can decay into electron-positron pairs when coupled to the electron current. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe the effective couplings of dark gauge bosons to the SM particles in a dense mediumwith the proper treatment of the effective field theory formalisms and thermal effects. In Sec. III, we investigate the dark gauge boson production from negatively charged thermal pions in the pNS. Section IV is dedicated to discussing the phenomenological implications of two specific extensions of the SM with gauged U\u00f01\u00de: the dark photon model (only involving the kinetic mixing [31]) and the gauged B \u2212 L model (which is anomaly free if right-handed neutrinos are introduced). We then provide discussions and conclusion in Sec. V."

In the regime of weak coupling, which governs the linear response, the effective couplings of dark gauge bosons follow the same form of operators in Eq. (2) for leptons, Eq. (12) for hadrons, with the following redefined couplings (for details, see Refs.

They become relevant at the resonance Re\u03c0T;L \u00bc m2\u03b30 . In the case that electrons are highly degenerate (i.e., pF \u226b Tc for the electron Fermi momentum pF \u2243 \u00f03\u03c02ne\u00de1=3 and the core temperature Tc \u2243 30 MeV) and relativistic (i.e., me \u226a pF), the real parts of \u03c0T;L approximate\nRe\u03c0T \u2243 3\n2 \u03c92pl; \u00f022\u00de\nRe\u03c0L \u2243 3\u03c92pl m2\u03b30\n\u03c92 ln min pF me ; \u03c9 m\u03b30\n\u00f023\u00de\nwhen m0\u03b3 \u2272 \u03c9. We confirm that the resonance has a minor impact on the effective couplings, primarily because of the similar magnitude of the imaginary part (for transverse modes [17]) or the failure to satisfy the resonance condition (for longitudinal modes).\n055014-3\nWe will investigate two well-motivated dark gauge boson scenarios, which are presented in the following list.\n(i) In the gauged B \u2212 L model, which is anomaly-free in the presence of right-handed neutrinos, the combination of cp \u2212 cn that breaks isospin symmetry (which is zero at the vacuum) is effectively generated due to the medium effect as discussed above. Without the kinetic mixing, we obtain\ng0\u00f0q\u03030p \u2212 q\u03030n\u00dejB\u2212L \u00bc g0 \u03c0T;L\nm2\u03b30 \u2212 \u03c0T;L : \u00f024\u00de\nWe observe that this effective violation of isospin symmetry is found to be the same for U\u00f01\u00de symmetries that involve the electron number charge, such as the gauged Le \u2212 L\u03bc;\u03c4 model. (ii) Another model is the so-called dark photon model, in which no dark U\u00f01\u00de charge is assigned to the SM particles (i.e., q0f \u00bc 0), but there is a presence of kinetic mixing denoted by \u03b5. The effective isovector charge can be expressed as follows:\ng0\u00f0q\u03030p \u2212 q\u03030n\u00dejDP \u00bc \u03b5e m2\u03b30\nm2\u03b30 \u2212 \u03c0T;L : \u00f025\u00de\nSo far, we have primarily focused on the effective Lagrangian involving pions and nucleons (p, n). However, before we conclude this section, it is worth discussing the potential effects of other baryons, particularly the \u0394 resonance, on the production of dark gauge bosons. In the case of axion modes, for instance, processes such as \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 an [21,22] can be additionally mediated by \u0394 baryons, resulting in an enhanced interaction rate [41]. Therefore, it is important to examine whether a similar enhancement associated with the \u0394 resonance also occurs in the context of dark gauge boson production. As we have discussed in this section, the interactions involving the \u0394 field can be described by terms that respect certain symmetries [42\u201345]. The coupling \u03b30-N-\u0394 is particularly relevant for contributions to \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b30n through an intermediate \u0394 resonance. This coupling is derived from the effective chiral Lagrangian involving photons (for isovector components), which arises from plasma mixing or the aforementioned kinetic mixing. In the framework of chiral expansion, the leading-order \u03b30-N-\u0394 coupling emerges at O\u00f0\u03c92=m2N\u00de in the form of the magnetic dipole moment due to the underlying spin-3=2 gauge symmetry [42\u201345]. In comparison, we note that the a-N-\u0394 couplings in axion models occur atO\u00f0\u03c9=mN\u00de as the neutral pion field is replaced with the axion [46,47]. Therefore, we do not expect a similar enhancement through the \u0394 baryon mediator in the case of dark gauge bosons, unlike what occurs in axion models. This justifies our simplification."

            "text": "Let us now compute the rate of dark gauge boson production via pion-proton reactions, \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b30n. The effective couplings between the dark gauge boson and hadrons, as given in Eq. (12) leads to the four diagrams that are illustrated in Fig. 1; the solid, dashed, and wavy lines represent the nucleon, pion, and dark gauge boson, respectively. The external dark gauge boson can be attached to the nucleon line through the nucleon current couplings, which are depicted in the two upper diagrams. In addition, there is a four-point vertex originating from the contact \u03c0-N-\u03b30 interaction, represented by the lower left diagram. Finally, the diagram mediated by the \u03c0-\u03c0-\u03b30 couplings is shown in the lower right diagram. Let us denote the four-momentum of the initial proton and the final neutron as pp and pn, respectively, while the four-momentum of the incident negatively charged pion is represented by p\u03c0.

Here, u\u00f0pN\u00de denotes the spinor of a nucleon N, mN represents the nucleon mass, m\u03c0 is the pion mass, and \u03f5\u03bc stands for the polarization vector of the dark gauge boson. In these expressions, as a reasonable\n055014-4\napproximation, we neglect the mass of the dark gauge boson, m\u03b30 . At the vacuum where p2\u03c0 \u00bc m2\u03c0 , one can straightforwardly verify the fulfillment of the WardTakahashi identity [48,49] (i.e., the current conservation law) by observing that the total amplitude Mtot \u00bc MN \u00fe Mcon \u00feM\u03c0 vanishes when replacing \u03f5\u03bc \u2192 \u00bdp\u03b30 \u03bc. This ensures that the four diagrams depicted in Fig. 1 constitute the complete set at the leading order.

Here Ei and p\u20d7i denote the energy and spatial momentum of each particle i \u00bc \u00f0p; n; \u03c0\u00de. For the pion occupation number, we approximate f\u03c0 as e\u2212\u00f0E\u03c0\u2212\u03bc\u03c0\u00de=T , adopting the Boltzmann distribution instead of the Bose-Einstein distribution. This choice ensures consistency with the virial expansion, providing an appropriate approach to describing thermal pions in the presence of the nuclear medium [20]. Before deriving the total scattering amplitude squared as the crucial ingredient in Eq. (29), we highlight some kinematic features of the Panofsky process \u03c0\u2212p \u2192 \u03b30n [25] that simplify the analytical evaluation related with the energy-momentum conservation as done in the axion case [21\u201323]. The integral over dp\u20d7n can be explicitly eliminated by utilizing the spatial momentum conservation, \u03b4\u00f03\u00de\u00f0p\u20d7p \u00fe p\u20d7\u03c0 \u2212 p\u20d7n \u2212 k\u20d7\u00de. Then, the energy conservation condition \u03b4\u00f0Ep \u00fe E\u03c0 \u2212 En \u2212 \u03c9\u00de reveals a subtle dependence on the angular relation between k\u20d7 and both p\u20d7p and p\u20d7\u03c0 . Nevertheless, due to the sufficiently low temperature and the chemical potential of nucleons in the pNS core, the nucleons remain massive and nonrelativistic. This circumstance yields En \u00bc Ep \u00feO\u00f0m2\u03c0=mN\u00de, allowing us to take \u03c9 \u2243 E\u03c0 at a leading order approximation, i.e., \u03b4\u00f0Ep \u00fe E\u03c0 \u2212 En \u2212 \u03c9\u00de \u2243 \u03b4\u00f0E\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c9\u00de. Therefore, the incident pion energy is efficiently converted into that of the emitted dark gauge boson through an elastic process. For the vector current coupling, the spin sum for the dark gauge boson polarization vector \u03f5\u03bc is given by\nX T \u03f5 \u03bc\u03f5\u03bd \u2192 \u2212g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 m2\u03b30 k2 g\u03bc0g\u03bd0; \u00f030\u00de\nX L \u03f5 \u03bc\u03f5\u03bd \u2192 m2\u03b30 k2 g\u03bc0g\u03bd0 \u00f031\u00de\nfor the transverse (T) and longitudinal (L) components, respectively.

To achieve this, we employ the phenomenological mean-field theory framework. Within this framework, nuclear interactions reduce the effective nucleon masses. At the nonrelativistic regime, the nucleon energy can be expressed as [50\u201352]\nEN \u2243mN \u00fe jp\u20d7N j2 2m N \u00feUN; \u00f035\u00de\nwhere UN is the mean-field potential energy [53] obtained from Ref. [20], andm N denotes the Landau effective masses [54]. The ratio of m N to mN can be found in Ref. [52]. Recently, Ref. [20] has implemented the relativistic virial expansion as a model-independent approach to investigate the effects of the strong interactions between nucleons and pions on thermodynamic properties of pions. By utilizing the empirical s-wave and p-wave pion-nucleon phase shifts [55], the enhanced number density of negative-charge pions is obtained. Moreover, the pion self-energy is correlated with the pseudo-potential of the pion-nucleon interactions, which is also accounted for through the pionnucleon phase shifts. These findings are reflected in the pion dispersion (for details, see Ref. [20])\nE\u03c0 \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi jp\u20d7\u03c0j2 \u00fem2\u03c0 q \u00fe \u03a3\u03c0\u00f0jp\u20d7\u03c0j\u00de; \u00f036\u00de\n055014-5\nwhere \u03a3\u03c0\u00f0jp\u20d7\u03c0j\u00de is the real part of the momentum-dependent pion self-energy. The strength of the pseudopotential, characterized by a fudge factor \u03b1 in Ref. [20], is determined to match the thermal pion abundance in the virial expansion to that from the Boltzmann distribution with Eq. (36). The modified pion dispersion relation may impact on corecollapse supernova dynamics, such as altering the mean free path of low energy muon neutrinos as discussed in Ref. [20]. Interestingly, the pion dispersion relation in Eq. (36) exhibits a space-like behavior (i.e., E\u03c0 < jp\u20d7\u03c0j) at rather high momentum values due to the strongly attractive pwave interaction with nucleons [20]. In Fig. 2, we consider the pNS model parameters \u03c1 \u00bc \u03c1sat, Tc \u00bc 30 MeV, and the proton fraction Yp \u2261 np=nB \u00bc 0.3. The blue line indicates jp\u20d7\u03c0j=\u03c9, which indeed exceeds unity (dashed gray) at jp\u20d7\u03c0j > 200 MeV. This tachyonic behavior could be problematic when we compute the dark gauge boson emissivity because the phase space integral in Eq. (29) may contain a infrared divergence from the t-channel pion mediator in the lower right diagram in Fig. 1 with the matrix element given by Eq. (28). To address this, we include the \u00f0m2\u03c0 \u2212 p2\u03c0\u00de=2 term in the denominator of Eq. (28), which acts as a regulator to mitigate the possible divergence arising from p2\u03c0 \u2264 0 in the high-momentum regime. The integration over the relative angle between p\u0302\u03c0 and k\u0302 with the above prescription naturally reveals the argument of jp\u20d7\u03c0j\u03c9=\u03c9\u03032 in the inverse hyperbolic tangent functions in Eqs. (32) and (33), not jp\u20d7\u03c0j=\u03c9 as expected in the vacuum. Such behavior is illustrated by the red line in Fig. 2. In the graph, jp\u20d7\u03c0j\u03c9=\u03c9\u03032 asymptotically approaches but never crosses the dashed gray line, which represents unity. We evaluate Eq. (29) using the squared scattering amplitudes presented in Eqs. (32) and (33). This allows us to approximate the volume emissivity of dark gauge bosons with the following equations\n\u00bdQ\u03b30 T \u2243 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2m 3N T 11\n\u03c010f4\u03c0\ns zpz\u03c0 Z dxp\nx2p ex 2 p \u00fe zp ex 2 p ex 2 p \u00fe zn\n\u00d7 Z\ndx\u03c0jg0\u00f0q\u03030n \u2212 q\u03030p\u00dej2T x2\u03c0\u03ba\u03c0 e\u03ba\u03c0\u2212y\u03c0\n\u00d7 1\u00fe y\u0303 2 \u03c0\n\u03ba\u03032\u03c0\n1 \u2212 tanh\u22121\u00bdx\u03c0\u03ba\u03c0=\u03ba\u03032\u03c0 x\u03c0\u03ba\u03c0=\u03ba\u03032\u03c0\n; \u00f037\u00de\n\u00bdQ\u03b30 L \u2243 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2m 3N m 4 \u03b30T 7\n\u03c010f4\u03c0\ns zpz\u03c0 Z dxp\nx2p ex 2 p \u00fe zp ex 2 p ex 2 p \u00fe zn\n\u00d7 Z\ndx\u03c0jg0\u00f0q\u03030n \u2212 q\u03030p\u00dej2L x2\u03c0\u03ba\u22121\u03c0 e\u03ba\u03c0\u2212y\u03c0\n\u00d7\ntanh\u22121\u00bdx\u03c0\u03ba\u03c0=\u03ba\u03032\u03c0\nx\u03c0\u03ba\u03c0=\u03ba\u03032\u03c0 \u2212 1\n\u00fe y\u0303 2 \u03c0\n\u03ba\u03032\u03c0\ntanh\u22121\u00bdx\u03c0\u03ba\u03c0=\u03ba\u03032\u03c0\nx\u03c0\u03ba\u03c0=\u03ba\u03032\u03c0 \u2212 1 2\n\u00f038\u00de\nfor the fugacity of a particle i, zi \u00bc exp \u00bd\u00f0\u03bci \u2212mi\u00de=T , xp \u00bc jp\u20d7pj= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2m NT p , x\u03c0 \u00bc jp\u20d7\u03c0j=T, \u03ba\u03c0 \u00bc \u03c9=T, \u03ba\u0303\u03c0 \u00bc \u03c9\u0303=T, y\u03c0 \u00bc m\u03c0=T, and y\u03032\u03c0 \u00bc p2\u03c0=T2. It is important to note that the integration over x\u03c0 must consider the momentumdependent effective coupling g0\u00f0q\u0303n \u2212 q\u0303p\u00de discussed in the previous section. We compute the dark gauge boson production rate Q\u03b30 numerically for the fiducial parameter set of \u03c1 \u00bc \u03c1sat, Tc \u00bc 30 MeV, and Yp \u00bc 0.3 as the typical circumstance of the pNS interior at 1 second after core bounce. Following the approach of Ref. [20], we determine the fugacities zp, zn, and z\u03c0 using the mean-field theory formalism for nucleon-nucleon interactions and the virial expansion for pion-nucleon interactions. These methods account for the abundance of negative-charged pions Y\u03c0\u2212 \u00bc O\u00f01\u00de% and the effective pion dispersion relation (Fig. 2). In Fig. 3, the\n055014-6\nsolid black line depicts the differential pion-induced dark gauge boson emissivity dQ\u03b30=d\u03c9 in the case of the gauged B \u2212 L model with m\u03b30 \u00bc 1 MeV. For the dark photon model, the overall spectrum is rescaled by replacing g0\u03c0T with \u03b5em2\u03b30 since the transverse components dominate the total emissivity. The numerical results indicates that the averaged dark gauge boson energy h\u03c9i via pionic reactions approximates 200 MeV. For comparison, we also include the dark gauge boson distribution assuming the \u03c0\u2212 dispersion relation in vacuum, represented by the dashed gray line. This shows clearly a relatively suppression of the spectral function due to the smaller thermal occupation of \u03c0\u2212 abundance. The noteworthy characteristic of pion-nucleon reactions is to generate dark gauge bosons in the energy range of 200 MeV to 300 MeV. This energy range is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the core temperature which is typically expected in other thermodynamic processes such as nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. In the next section, we will discuss some phenomenological implications of dark gauge bosons associated with supernova.\nIV. IMPLICATIONS\nDark gauge bosons produced inside the pNS subsequently propagate outward. They can be reabsorbed or trapped into the medium through its interactions with the SM particles. These absorptive effects may lead to various phenomenological consequences that will be explored in this section. There are several processes for dark gauge bosons to be reabsorbed or converted into SM particles in a medium, such as inverse bremsstrahlung (\u03b30NN \u2192 NN), inverse semi-Compton scattering (\u03b30e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3e\u2212), and decay (e.g., \u03b30 \u2192 e\u2212e\u00fe). We observe that for masses above the 2me threshold, decays into electron-positron pairs typically dominate the absorptive width when dark gauge bosons couple to the electron current (as demonstrated in Ref. [40] for the dark photon model). When considering decays of dark gauge bosons outside the pNS, where the electron density rapidly diminishes, the effects of Pauli blocking and plasma become negligible. Therefore, we can use the decay rate in vacuum given by:\n\u0393 \u00bc g 02 e\n12\u03c0\nm2\u03b30\n\u03c9\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1 \u2212\n4m2e m2\u03b30\ns 1\u00fe 2m 2 e\nm2\u03b30\n\u0398\u00f0m\u03b30 \u2212 2me\u00de; \u00f039\u00de\nwhere g0e \u00bc \u00f0\u2212\u03b5e\u00fe g0q0e\u00de denotes the coupling to the electron in the vacuum. In principle, the energy-dependent absorption rate has to be included in the integration over the produced dark gauge bosons spectrum. However, as a good approximation for convenience, we simply estimate the decay rate at the typical energy of h\u03c9i \u00bc 200 MeV."

            "text": "Observations of neutrinos from SN1987A by underground detectors (IMB [56], Kamiokande II [57], and Baksan [58]) provide explicit evidence for the cooling of the pNS. Notably, the duration of the neutrino flux, which lasts for about 10 seconds after the bounce, is well explained by simulations assuming only the Standard Model, where the gravitational binding energy of the pNS is mainly released through energy diffusion at the neutrino sphere. Novel particles can contribute to the cooling of the pNS, and if their cooling effect is significant, it could reduce the observed duration of the neutrino flux. However, to be consistent with the pNS evolution inferred from the neutrino observations, the net luminosity of novel particles streaming out of the pNS must be subdominant. This is a standard principle of the stellar cooling argument. The upper bound on the emissivity of novel particles is determined by the well-known Raffelt criterion established in Ref. [11]. This criterion, given by\nQ\u03b30\n\u03c1 e\u2212\u0393rfar < 1019 erg g\u22121 sec\u22121; \u00f040\u00de\napplies at 1 second after the bounce, assuming typical conditions of \u03c1 \u00bc \u03c1sat and T \u00bc Tc. Here, rfar represents the \u201cfar radius\u201d [40], which is introduced to measure the additional cooling in the heat reservoir (neutrino sphere) for supernova neutrinos. If a novel particle is absorbed within rfar, its impact on the energy transfer that affects the observed neutrino signal is less significant. For our analysis, we approximately take rfar \u00bc 1000 km as a reasonable upper value based on the shock radius."

            "text": "In addition to the extra energy leakage discussed above, novel particles propagating outside the pNS have the potential to transport their energy to the stellar envelope, thus contributing to the burst of the outer material (the supernova explosion). The SN observables, such as light curves and spectroscopic ejecta expansion velocities, can be used to determine the explosion energy, as well as other explosion characteristics like the ejecta mass and the newly synthesized 56Ni mass, through numerical hydrodynamics simulations. Hydrodynamical modeling of core-collapse supernovae typically yields an explosion energy on the order of O\u00f01\u00deB, where B (bethe) is defined as 1051 erg. Therefore, the energy deposition in the stellar envelope resulting from the absorption of novel particles, as discussed in our analysis, should not exceed 2B, which corresponds to 1% of the total binding energy of the pNS. This idea was initially suggested by Ref. [59] and has been further explored in recent studies [60\u201362]. We present roughly estimated constraints on dark gauge bosons given by\n055014-7\nQ\u03b30\n\u03c1 \u00f0e\u2212\u0393rfar \u2212 e\u2212\u0393renv\u00de < 1017 erg g\u22121 sec\u22121; \u00f041\u00de\nwhere renv represents the radius of the progenitor star, assumed to be a red supergiant. In our analysis for type-II supernovae, we adopt renv \u00bc 109 km. While the criterion in Eq. (41) is based on observations of typical explosion energies on the order of O\u00f01\u00deB, it can be refined by considering low-energy supernovae such as SN1054 leading to the Crab nebula [63,64] and many others [65\u201368]. These supernovae exhibit narrow spectral lines and lower luminosity at late times, indicating slower expansion velocities and lower ejected 56Ni masses (around 3-4 times lower). As a result, the low-energy supernova explosion energy is on the sub-O\u00f00.1\u00deB, at least one order of magnitude below the typical value. In general, novel particles are predominantly produced in the pNS, and their luminosity is less dependent on supernova modeling. Therefore, more stringent constraints can potentially be obtained from observations of low-energy supernovae. For further details and applications to axion physics, refer to Ref. [62]."

Precise measurements of the 511 keV line flux [72\u201375] using the SPI spectrometer [76] on the INTEGRAL satellite have placed conservative bounds on the galactic positron injection rate, limiting it to no more thanO\u00f01043\u00dee\u00fe s\u22121 [77,78]. It is worth noting that the analysis of the measured gamma-ray spectrum at higher energy bands [79,80] may impose even more stringent constraints on the positron injection rate. Apart from annihilation at rest, propagating positrons also undergo in-flight annihilation, which contributes to the continuum flux above the 511 keV line. When positrons initially possess higher energy, their chances of surviving until they enter the nonrelativistic regime decrease [79,81], resulting in a larger flux of radiation above 511 keV over a wider energy range up to their initial energy [80]. For instance, 23% of positrons with an initial energy of 100 MeV undergo in-flight annihilation, compared to 11% for 10 MeV and 1.4% for 1 MeV. By considering mono-energetic positron injection above 100 MeV and the resulting radiation spectrum, the COMPTEL gamma-ray observations [82] in the 1-3, 3-10, and 10\u201330 MeV energy bands have set an upper bound on the injection rate of approximately O\u00f01042\u00dee\u00fe s\u22121 [80].\nDark gauge bosons with masses m\u03b30 > 2me could serve as a source of energetic positron injection in the galaxy [78,83], provided that their decay length is sufficiently large compared to the escape radius resc. Within resc, interactions with the surrounding medium, such as annihilation with ambient electrons, significantly hinder the escape of positrons from the star. For type-II supernovae, resc is approximately 109 km during the relevant timescale before the shock wave reaches an outer layer [78], as it is equivalent to the radius of the progenitor star, renv. Considering that type-II supernova events occur at a frequency of approximately 2 per century [84], the total amount of injected positrons from supernovae has to be less thanO\u00f01052\u00dee\u00fe. The resultant constraints can be written by\nQ\u03b30\n\u03c1 mpNS \u0394t h\u03c9i e \u2212\u0393resc < 1052e\u00fe \u00f042\u00de\nwith the time duration \u0394t \u00bc 10 sec."

            "text": "An additional constraint arises when considering SN1987A, particularly in scenarios where novel particles produced inside the proto-neutron star (pNS) decay outside the photosphere of the star. Within the photosphere, photons are effectively trapped and only emitted through thermal surface emission, making it difficult for highly energetic photons to directly escape the star. However, if novel particles are able to freely stream out of the star and subsequently decay into photons, we would expect gammaray signals to be detected at the same time as the neutrino observations, without any significant time delay. At the time of the SN1987A neutrino observations, the gamma-ray spectrometer (GRS) on the Solar Maximum Mission satellite [85] was in operation. Since the detector was pointed toward the Sun at a 90\u00b0 angle relative to the direction of SN1987A, gamma-rays from SN1987Awould bump into the side of the instrument, which was shielded by 2.5 g cm\u22122 of spacecraft aluminium. This shielding effect indirectly left signals in the detectors, allowing the estimation of the gamma-ray flux. However, no significant excess of gamma-ray signals above the expected background was detected by the GRS in the three energy bands of 4.1\u20136.4 MeV, 10\u201325 MeV, and 25\u2013100 MeV, for 223.2 sec before entering calibration mode [86]. Consequently, an upper bound on the gamma-ray fluence, denoted as F \u03b3 , was determined for each energy band. The conservative limit, obtained by summing the fluences in all energy bins, is given asF \u03b3 \u2272 10 cm\u22122 [78]. In other words, the total number of escaped gamma-rays was constrained to be small as N\u03b3 < 4 \u00d7 1048. The primary decay process of the leading dark gauge boson involving a photon is \u03b30 \u2192 e\u2212e\u00fe\u03b3. The partial decay width of this process is of O\u00f0\u03b1\u00de relative to that of the e\u2212e\u00fe\n055014-8\nchannel. See Appendix in Ref. [78] for derivation of this partial decay width.

            "text": "Fig. 4 illustrates the excluded parameter region of the gauged B \u2212 L model. The constraints with the dashed boundary are newly excluded by the arguments discussed in this paper. The red region corresponds to the stellar cooling constraint based on the production of gaugedB \u2212 L bosons through thermal pion scatterings, as described in Sec. III. In comparison with the brown-shaded region for the preceding SN1987A cooling constraint, which considers bremsstrahlung of dark gauge bosons via nucleonnucleon scatterings [17] (notice that the estimation is performed within a more practical approach of the pNS\nprofile), the pion-induced cooling bound is less stringent due to the somewhat less efficient energy loss rate. For masses above 2me, the constraint on the supernova explosion energy given in Eq. (41) corresponds to the green region, which is comparable to the cooling argument. Furthermore, the contributions to galactic positron injection and a prompt SN1987A gamma-ray signal impose significant constraints on the blue and orange regions, respectively. The gray and pink regions represent preexisting constraints from the cooling argument on low-density stars [87,88], young isolated neutron stars (such as those in Cas A and SN1987A) [36], and big bang nucleosynthesis [89,90], respectively. Figure 5 presents the exclusion plot for the dark photon model. Each colored region, delineated by a dashed boundary, is disfavored due to phenomenological considerations related to dark photon production inside the pNS through scatterings involving \u03c0\u2212, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The constraints on the dark photon in the previous literature are given by the brown, cyan, and magenta region from the observed neutrino cooling of SN1987A [40], the explosion energy [60], and the gamma-ray observations associated with core-collapse supernovae [78], respectively. These constraints overlook the contribution of thermal pions. The current bounds based on the stellar evolution [39,91] and\n055014-9\nbig bang nucleosynthesis [77,92,93] are depicted as the gray and pink regions, respectively. It is worth noting that the constraints associated with thermal pions (indicated by the regions with dashed line boundaries in Figs. 4 and 5) are primarily determined by the transverse components of dark gauge bosons. The characteristic of \u03c9 \u226b \u03c9pl; T for pionic processes accounts for a weaker emissivity of the longitudinal polarization by the factor of \u00f0m2\u03b30=\u03c92\u00de in Eq. (31) from the current conservation law and/or \u00f0\u03c94pl=\u03c94\u00de from the plasma effect on the couplings of longitudinal gauged B \u2212 L bosons (see the effective isospin breaking term in Eq. (24) with Eq. (23) for \u03c0L). Even if a sizable coupling strength could generate a sufficient amount of longitudinal dark gauge bosons to leave an imprint on the observables, such dark gauge bosons are immediately reabsorbed into the medium near their production point that leads to an exponentially suppressed net luminosity. The effective isovector terms g0\u00f0q\u03030p \u2212 q\u03030n\u00de of gauged B \u2212 L bosons and dark photons have the distinct feature as described in Eqs. (24) and (25), respectively, depending on the mass values of the dark gauge bosons. The behavior of the emissivity for the transverse components, with Re\u03c0T \u00bc O\u00f01\u00de\u03c92pl being constant over the momentum space of interest, relies on the competition between the dark gauge boson mass m\u03b30 and the plasma frequency \u03c9pl \u223c 10 MeV.\n(i) In the regime ofm2\u03b30 \u226a \u03c9 2 pl, we find \u00f0q\u03030p \u2212 q\u03030n\u00de \u221d m0\u03b30\nfor the gauged B \u2212 Lmodel and \u00f0q\u03030p \u2212 q\u03030n\u00de \u221d m2\u03b30 for the dark photon model. Thus, the upper bounds on dark photons is quadratically weaker for a lower mass, whereas those on gauged B \u2212 L bosons have flat (the red and blue in Fig. 4) or a mild mass dependence due to the decay length being comparable to the size of the progenitor and the branching ratio of the three body decay \u03b30 \u2192 e\u2212e\u00fe\u03b3 (the green and orange in Fig. 4). (ii) In the regime where the dark gauge boson masses are above the plasma frequency, m2\u03b30 \u226b \u03c9 2 pl, the\neffective coupling behaviors change. For the gauged B \u2212 L model, we have \u00f0q\u03030p \u2212 q\u03030n\u00de \u221d m\u22122\u03b30 , while for the dark photon model, \u00f0q\u03030p \u2212 q\u03030n\u00de \u221d m0\u03b30 . In contrast to the low-mass limit discussed above, the upper bounds on gauged B \u2212 L bosons are now quadratically weaker for a larger mass, and those on dark photons become relatively constant up to around h\u03c9i \u2248 200 MeV.\nWe observe that the lower bounds are strongly influenced by the decay length, as described in Eq. (39), resulting in inverse linear slopes considering \u0393\u03b30 \u221d \u00f0g0m\u03b30 \u00de2. As a result, the constraints based on pionic processes do not reach the mass ranges above 100 MeV in the gauged B \u2212 L model, whereas they are attainable in the dark photon model."

            "heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We have extensively explored the production of dark gauge bosons induced by pions in the core-collapse supernova, particularly in the formation of protoneutron stars (pNS) with the high temperature T \u223c 30 MeV and the large electron chemical potential \u03bce \u00bc \u03bcn \u2212 \u03bcp \u223c 200 MeV. As discussed in Sec. III, the presence of negatively charged pions in a hot and dense environment plays a significant role for the dark gauge boson production and cannot be disregarded. In the framework of proper effective theories for an additional U\u00f01\u00de gauge boson, described in Sec. II, the symmetry argument in ChPT accounts for the isospin breaking aspect of pionic processes that are also subject to the plasma effects. This leads to the couplings between the dark gauge boson to the electromagnetic current: dark photons through the kinetic mixing, and gauged B \u2212 L bosons through the plasma mixing [15]. To determine the emissivity of dark gauge bosons, we conducted both analytical and numerical calculations, utilizing the reliable method of the relativistic virial expansion proposed in Ref. [20]. This effectively characterizes the strongly interacting pion-nucleon plasma. We have discussed the pion-induced dark gauge boson production in a core-collapse supernova, which is forming the pSN with the high temperature T \u223c 30MeV and the large electron chemical potential \u03bce \u00bc \u03bcn \u2212\u03bcp\u223c 200MeV. It is enough for negatively charged pions to comprise a nonnegligible fraction in a hot dense matter (Sec. III). In the context of the proper effective theory frameworks for an additional U\u00f01\u00de gauge boson (Sec. II), the symmetry argument in ChPT accounts for the isospin breaking aspect of pionic processes that could be affected by the plasma effects. It connects dark gauge bosons to the electromagnetic current; dark photons through the kinetic mixing and gauged B \u2212 L bosons through the plasma mixing [15]. We computed the emissivity of dark gauge bosons analytically and numerically within the reliable method of the relativistic virial expansion [20] that describes the strongly interacting pion-nucleon plasma. The produced dark gauge bosons can have an impact on various observations associated with supernovae. We have examined several phenomenological implications of dark gauge bosons (Sec. IV): the observed neutrino burst of SN1987A, the inferred supernova explosion energy, the galactic positron injection to cause diffuse gamma-ray emissions from the Galactic center, and the nonobservation of prompt gamma-rays in SN1987A. The implications depend on the distribution of energy carried away or accumulated in specific regions of the star by dark gauge bosons. In models where dark gauge bosons couple to the electron current, such as the dark photon and the gauged B \u2212 L models, the dominant contribution to the optical depth of a dark gauge boson with a mass greater than 2me arises from its decay into electron-positron pairs. Each observational consequence gives rise to a corresponding\n055014-10\nbound, which can be estimated analytically with an order of magnitude approximation, as expressed in Eqs. (40)\u2013(43). These constraints allow us to establish limits on the gauged B \u2212 L and dark photon models, which are illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. It is noticed that the newly derived constraints in this work for the gauged B \u2212 L model and the dark photon model can be applied to other scenarios as well. The isovector structures described in Eqs. (24) and (25) for the gauged B \u2212 L model and the dark photon model require a charge assignment of q0p \u2212 q0n \u00bc 0 and q0p \u2212 q0n \u00fe q0e \u00bc 0 (or equivalently a nonvanishing kinetic mixing), respectively. In addition, the condition q0e \u2260 0 is a common requirement for decay into electron-positron pairs. For example, our results can be utilized to constrain the lepton flavor-dependent gauged U\u00f01\u00de extensions of the Standard Model [94]. In the case of gauged Le \u2212 L\u03bc=\u03c4 models, which satisfy q0e \u2260 0 and q0p \u2212 q0n \u00bc 0, the constraints derived from supernova pions explicitly follow the results in Fig. 4 for the gauged B \u2212 L model. In the gauged L\u03bc \u2212 L\u03c4 model, despite the absence of tree-level q0e, the irreducible kinetic mixing from the muon and tau loop imposes the constraints that can be inferred from Fig. 5 for the dark photon model, taking into account the loop-suppressed rescaling factor. We have considered energy transfer of dark gauge boson to visible particles through the its decays such as \u03b30 \u2192 e\u2212e\u00fe, \u03b30 \u2192 e\u2212e\u00fe\u03b3, and \u03b30 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\u03b3. However, even if m\u03b30 < 2me, the energy of dark gauge bosons could be deposited in a medium or converted into the creation of SM particles. Within the star, the interaction between dark gauge bosons and matter causes their kinetic energy to be redistributed within the medium. The efficiency of this kinematic trapping or reabsorption depends on the density of the medium, which decreases sharply outside the pNS. Consequently, the energy transport only affects the cooling of the pNS by dark gauge bosons. Roughly speaking, considering the lower emissivity from pionic processes and a similar optical length compared to nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung [17], we do not expect the lower bound from pion-induced cooling to differ significantly from that of nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. This explains why the top boundary of the red region in Fig. 4 is artificially truncated. In addition to the decay of dark gauge bosons, they can also undergo conversion into photons. This conversion arises from the mixing between dark gauge bosons and photons, which is induced by either kinetic mixing parametrized by \u03b5 or plasma effects (as discussed around Eq. (10) in [36]). Generally, the probability of conversion during propagation is typically on the order of O\u00f0g02\u00de, representing the square of the mixing angle. However, at resonance points where m2\u03b30 \u00bc \u03c0T;L, the conversion probability can be dramatically enhanced. This resonant conversion of dark gauge bosons to photons outside the star can result in an instantaneous gamma-ray flux. However,\nthe energy of the converted photons corresponds to that of the dark gauge bosons, which is above the energy range measured by the Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS). On the other hand, transitions occurring inside the star would contribute to the supernova explosion. The rate of resonant conversion is determined by the adiabaticity at the resonance point, which depends on how the quantity \u03c0T;L \u221d ne varies in space. In the envelope regime of the progenitor, where O\u00f0104\u00de km\u2272 r\u2272 renv, the electron density rapidly decreases aswemove outward.Consequently, the substantial nonadiabaticity results in a small conversion rate. However, when considering the outer region of the progenitor core spanning from approximately rfar \u00bc O\u00f0103\u00de km to O\u00f0104\u00de km, where the shock wave has not yet reached, the density appears to remain relatively constant at around O\u00f0106\u00de g cm\u22123. Therefore, within this regime, transverse dark gauge bosonswith amass ofO\u00f010\u00de keVmayefficiently convert into photons through an adiabatic level-crossing transition. Nevertheless, conducting a detailed investigation of the progenitor profile is imperative, as it goes beyond the scope of this paper. We leave the comprehensive discussion and analysis of this matter to future work. Finally, we would like to address important uncertainties regarding our analysis. The concise analytic expressions presented in Eqs. (40)\u2013(43) are based on a simplified assumption that the interior of the pNS is homogeneous in terms of thermodynamic properties. This single-zone approximation may oversimplify the actual pNS profile, particularly when considering thermal pions. The thermodynamic variables we have considered (\u03c1 \u00bc \u03c1sat, T \u00bc 30 MeV, and Yp \u00bc 0.3) correspond to typical conditions at the surface of the pNS, approximately 1 second after core bounce. Due to the relatively high temperature, thermal negatively-charged pions mainly reside near the surface, as described in Ref. [22]. Therefore, a more realistic pNS profile would likely lead to an O\u00f01\u00de modification to the pionic dark gauge boson emissivity, resulting in minor changes to the constraints shown in Figs. 4 and 5. For further insights into the single-zone approximation in the context of the supernova explosion argument, we refer to Ref. [62]. It is important to note that the results based on Eqs. (40)\u2013(43) should be considered as rough estimates. Inclusion of bremsstrahlung dark gauge bosons through nucleon scatterings [17] for each implication in Sec. IV could enhance our results. However, as pointed out in Ref. [52] regarding the axion case, estimating nucleonnucleon bremsstrahlung scatterings involves theoretical uncertainties, potentially leading to rates that are orders of magnitude lower than those computed using the firstorder approximation, such as the one-pion-exchange approximation. On the other hand, our investigation into the production of dark gauge bosons via pion-induced scatterings, as extensively explored in this paper, reveals its robustness. This is attributed to our utilization of a model-independent methodology, the relativistic virial\n055014-11\nexpansion [20], which relies on empirical information regarding pion-nucleon scattering and its corresponding phase shift [55]."
