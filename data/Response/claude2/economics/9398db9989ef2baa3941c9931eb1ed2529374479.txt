 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Expand the model to include more commodities beyond wheat and corn. The framework could be applied to model trade in other critical agricultural products impacted by the war in Ukraine, like sunflower oil or fertilizers. 

2. Incorporate uncertainty into the model parameters like demand, supply prices, transportation costs, or exchange rates. This could better capture the volatility and risks in global commodity markets during times of conflict. Stochastic programming methods could be used.

3. Develop a dynamic version of the model to analyze trade flows and prices over time. This could provide insights into how markets adjust to shocks like the start of the war in Ukraine. 

4. Add competition between multiple producing countries beyond just Ukraine. For example, the model could examine how disruption of Ukrainian wheat exports impacts trade flows from other major exporters like Russia, France, or Canada.

5. Incorporate financial hedging instruments like futures contracts into the model. The research could analyze how hedging affects equilibrium prices and trade volumes during times of exchange rate fluctuations or supply uncertainty.
