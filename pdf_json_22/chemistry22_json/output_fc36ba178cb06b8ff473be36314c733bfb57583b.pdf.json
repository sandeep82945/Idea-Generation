    "abstractText": "BK type Ca-activated K channels activate in response to both voltage and Ca. The membrane-spanning voltage sensor domain (VSD) activation and Ca binding to the cytosolic tail domain (CTD) open the pore across the membrane, but the mechanisms that couple VSD activation and Ca binding to pore opening are not clear. Here we show that a compound, BC5, identified from in silico screening, interacts with the CTD-VSD interface and specifically modulates the Ca dependent activation mechanism. BC5 activates the channel in the absence of Ca binding but Ca binding inhibits BC5 effects. Thus, BC5 perturbs a pathway that couples Ca binding to pore opening to allosterically affect both, which is further supported by atomistic simulations and mutagenesis. The results suggest that the CTD-VSD interaction makes a major contribution to the mechanism of Ca dependent activation and is an important site for allosteric agonists to modulate BK channel activation.",

Magleby8, Jonathan R. Silva 1 , Jianhan Chen 6,7 , Xiaoqin Zou 2,3,4,5 & Jianmin Cui 1\nBK type Ca2+-activated K+ channels activate in response to both voltage and Ca2+. The membrane-spanning voltage sensor domain (VSD) activation and Ca2+ binding to the cytosolic tail domain (CTD) open the pore across the membrane, but the mechanisms that couple VSD activation and Ca2+ binding to pore opening are not clear. Here we show that a compound, BC5, identified from in silico screening, interacts with the CTD-VSD interface and specifically modulates the Ca2+ dependent activation mechanism. BC5 activates the channel in the absence of Ca2+ binding but Ca2+ binding inhibits BC5 effects. Thus, BC5 perturbs a pathway that couples Ca2+ binding to pore opening to allosterically affect both, which is further supported by atomistic simulations and mutagenesis. The results suggest that the CTD-VSD interaction makes a major contribution to the mechanism of Ca2+ dependent activation and is an important site for allosteric agonists to modulate BK channel activation.\nBK type Ca2+ activated K+ channels are important in regulating neural excitability1\u20133, neurotransmitter release4, and muscle contraction5,6. Aberrant function of BK channels is associated with various human diseases such as neurological disorders7\u20139, hypertension10 and impaired urinary control11. The function of BK channels relies on their activation by both elevated intracellular Ca2+ and depolarization of themembrane voltage. The opening of BK channels provides a negative feedback mechanism to hyperpolarize the membrane and reduce intracellular Ca2+ by deactivating voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels12. The Ca2+- and voltage-dependent activation of BK channels has been an important model system for understanding allosteric mechanisms of ion channel gating13. Unlike canonical voltage gated K+ channels, such as Shaker, BK channels exhibit an intrinsic open probability (Po ~ 10\u22126) in the absence of stimuli. Ca2+ binding or voltage sensor activation allosterically activates the channel by favoring the open state13,14. The mechanisms of voltage andCa2+-dependent BK channel activation have been described by an allosteric model13, which has successfully accounted for the functional properties of BK channel activation, pharmacology15, modulation by regulatory subunits16 andmutations17,18. Themolecular bases of these allosteric activation mechanisms are not clear. Understanding these molecular mechanisms may help reveal the physiological role of BK channels, facilitate the development of therapeutic agents that modulate BK channel activation, and elucidate fundamental mechanisms of allosteric modulation. BK channels are formed by four Slo1 subunits with structural domains that are associated with distinct functions19\u201321 (Fig. 1a).

Surrounding the pore are the voltage sensor domains (VSDs) from the four subunits, comprised of the transmembrane segments S1\u2013S4. Slo1 also contains an additional transmembrane segment S0. The cytosolic tail domain (CTD) of each Slo1 subunit harbors two Ca2+-binding sites, and the four CTDs, each containing two structural motifs known as the regulator of potassium conductance (RCK), form a ring-like structure, known as the gating ring. Studies have shown that Ca2+ and voltage activate BK channels with distinct molecular mechanisms such that depolarization can activate the channel in the absence of Ca2+ binding22, while Ca2+ binding can activate the channel when the voltage sensor is at the resting state13,14,23.

Although the sensors for Ca2+ and voltage25 and the properties of the activation gate25,26 have been identified, the allosteric coupling mechanisms between the sensors and the activation gate in BK channels are still under investigation27,28. One of the long-standing issues is to identify the paths of intramolecular interactions within the channel protein by which cytosolic Ca2+ binding or voltage sensor activation opens the channel pore across the membrane19,20,23,27\u201333. Another issue is that both Ca2+ and voltage open the same activation gate. Therefore, the respective paths for mediating voltage and Ca2+-dependent channel openingmustmerge eventually. AlthoughCa2+ and voltage activate BK channels via distinct mechanisms, the two activation mechanisms influence each other allosterically13,34. Where and how the allosteric paths for Ca2+- and voltage-dependent activation merge remains a fundamental question.\nIn BK channels while the CTD serves as the Ca2+ sensor it was also shown to contribute to voltage-dependent gating28,31,34, and CTD conformation was altered by voltage-dependent activation35. For Ca2+ binding at the CTD and for the VSD activation to open the pore, interactions among the CTD, VSD and the pore domains are essential. Although the structural domain interactions that are required for voltage and Ca2+-dependent activation have been intensively studied, mechanistic roles of these domain interactions remain poorly understood. In the Slo1 subunit the CTD is covalently connected to the S6 by a peptide of 15 amino acids, known as the C-linker. A previous study showed that deletion or insertion of C-linker residues altered Ca2+- and voltage-dependent activation in a manner that correlated with the C-linker length, suggesting that Ca2+ binding to the CTDmay open the channel by \u201ctugging\u201d the C-linker29. On the other hand, the CTD also has a non-covalent interaction with the VSD of its neighboring subunit (Fig. 1a). This interaction was first revealed by the discovery that the CTD and VSD form a close interface because residues from both the CTD and VSD of the neighboring subunits form a Mg2+-binding site, whichdiffers fromtheCa2+-binding sites inCTD.Mg2+ binding activates the channel by enhancing voltage-dependent activation via an electrostatic interaction with the voltage sensor36. The interactions between CTD and VSD were then more clearly shown by BK channel structures19,20. Based on the structural evidence, it was hypothesized that the CTD-VSD interaction may contribute to the coupling between Ca2+ binding and pore opening30. This notion was strongly supported by the fact that the comparison between the structure of the BK channel with Ca2+/Mg2+ bound and that of metal-free showed a large Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent change in the interface between CTD and VSD19,20. This hypothesis is also consistent with an earlier finding that the region of the CTD located close to the VSD is important in determining the different Ca2+ sensitivities among various BK channel homologs37. Furthermore, mutations at the CTD-VSD interface were also found to alter Ca2+ sensitivity27,38. However, thesemutations either had small effects on Ca2+-dependent activation38 or, besides reducing Ca2+-dependent activation, also altered voltage-dependent activation and resulted in an increase of the intrinsic open probability of the channel27. Did these mutations alter the Ca2+-dependent activation or did some of thesemutations alter the voltage-dependent activation by affecting the voltage sensor, which then indirectly affect Ca2+-dependent activation? Thus,whether the CTD-VSD interaction as revealed by structural data mediates coupling of Ca2+ binding to pore opening remains unclear.\nIn this studyweuse in silico screening to identify a compound that binds to a site at the CTD\u2013VSD interface and enhances BK channel activation. We find that the compound specifically enhances Ca2+dependent activation byperturbing the pathway for coupling between Ca2+ binding and pore opening. These results support the idea that the non-covalent CTD\u2013VSD interaction makes a major contribution to the coupling between Ca2+ binding and pore opening that is independent\nof voltage-dependent activation, and that the CTD\u2013VSD interface is an important site for allosteric agonists to enhance Ca2+-dependent activation of BK channels."

            "text": "In order to probe if the VSD\u2013CTD interaction of BK channels is required for Ca2+-dependent activation, we initiated an in silico search for compounds that may interfere with BK channel Ca2+-dependent activation. Specifically, we docked a subset of the Available Chemical Database (ACD,Molecular Design Ltd.) of about 4 \u00d7 104 compounds, in which each compound carries one or two charged groups with a net charge of 0, \u00b11, or \u00b12, to a site near the VSD-CTD interface (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1). Patch-clamp recordings of BK channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes with and without the candidate compounds from the in silico screening showed that one of the compounds, BC5 applied at the cytosolic side of the membrane patch (Fig. 1b), activated the channel as measured from the inward tail currents at a voltage (\u221280mV) more negative than the equilibrium potential of the K+ (0mV) (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 2a). BC5 shifted the voltage-dependent activation (GV relation) of BK channels to more negative voltages (Fig. 1d), with the concentration at the half-maximum GV shift (EC50) of 2.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M (Fig. 1e). In addition, BC5, applied in the cytosolic side of the membrane patch, also inhibited the outward BK currents at positive voltages (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2b).\nWe found that the activation and inhibition of BK channels by BC5 were independent molecular processes. BC5 inhibited the channel at a lower concentration than activation, with the halfmaximum inhibition concentration (IC50) of 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 2b). The inhibition was dependent on voltage, with weaker inhibition at less positive potentials (Fig. 1f) and no inhibition at a negative potential (Fig. 1c). These characteristics of inhibition are consistent with the mechanism that the positively charged BC5 acts as a pore blocker from the cytosolic side, and can be flushed out by negative voltages and inward K+ currents, reminiscent of Ca2+ and Mg2+ block of the channel39,40. Single channel recordings showed that BC5 caused brief closures during channel opening without altering the single channel conductance (Fig. 1g, h), consistent with the mechanism that BC5 acts as a discrete pore blocker with relatively fast on- and off-rates, but not fast enough to be a fast blocker that reduces single channel conductance. In addition, unlike BC5 activation, BC5 inhibition of the channel showed little dependence on Ca2+ (Fig. 1f) or Mg2+ (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b), and the mutations that reduced BC5 activation had little effect on BC5 inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). These results suggest that BC5 inhibition of the channel is an off-target effect, namely, in addition to interacting with our target docking site for channel activation (Fig. 1a), BC5 may interact with the pore (Supplementary Fig. 4c) to block the outward K+ currents.\nOur target docking site of BC5 in the BK channel is located near the Mg2+-binding site for channel activation, which is formed by residues from both the VSD and CTD36,41 (Fig. 2a). As shown in Fig. 2a, d, residue E399 is shared by both the Mg2+- and BC5-binding sites. If BC5 interacts with the target docking site to activate the channel, we expected that an electrostatic repulsion betweenMg2+ and the charges in BC5 and a direct competition between Mg2+ and BC5 for binding would reduce BC5 activation. Consistent with this idea, we found that BC5 at the same concentration (100 \u00b5M) induced less shift in GV relations in the presence of 10mM Mg2+ (Fig. 2b, c and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Likewise, a charge reversal mutation of the Mg2+-binding residue, D99R19, also reduced BC5 activation of the channel (Fig. 2c), although D99 is not part of the BC5-binding pocket, supporting that BC5 binds in the vicinity of the Mg2+-binding site.\nTo further characterize BC5 interactions with the target docking site, 200ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the open and\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:6784 3\nclosed states of BK channel with and without docked BC5 were performed in explicit membrane and water (see \u201cMethods\u201d) (SupplementaryTable 1). The results showedmultiple bindingmodes between BC5 and the channel that interchanged dynamically with time, and in the process BC5 interacted with different residues (Fig. 2d). As summarized in Supplementary Table 2, the hydrophobic naphthalenyl group of BC5was buried in contact with the intracellular side of S0, S1, S3, and S4 as well as the residue F395 from \u03b1B of CTD. The charged arginine part of BC5 interacted with the negatively charged residue E399 (Fig. 2d). The binding poses of BC5 weremore narrowly confined in the open conformation, suggesting that BC5 binding is stronger and may favor the open state of BK channels.

These mutant channels showed increased EC50 (Fig. 2f), suggesting that the mutations reduced BC5 binding by interrupting the interactions between those residues and BC5. Since BC5 binds to the channel with multiple modes, a mutation to a single residue in the binding pocket may not be sufficient to abolish BC5 binding. Instead, the mutation may prevent some of the binding modes but reinforce others. This may have happened to some of the mutations, which, while enhancing EC50, also increased the slope of the BC5 dose response and the maximum channel activation (Fig. 2e, f). To further disrupt BC5 binding, we made double, triple or quadruple mutations that combined these individual mutations. However, except for the two shown in Figs. 2e and 2f, the combined mutations abolished channel function. These results suggest that this pocket of residues are important for channel function. Consistently, we found that some of the individual mutations altered channel function (Supplementary\nFig. 5). These results support that BC5 enhances BK channel activation by binding to the target docking site.\nBK channels are activated by voltage and Ca2+ with distinct mechanisms7. Thus, we asked whether BC5 shifted the GV relation of BK channels by modulating the voltage or Ca2+-dependent activation mechanism. To address this question, we first examined whether BC5 modulated VSD activation in BK channels by measuring gating currents with and without BC5 (Fig. 3a). Unlike the GV relationship, the voltage dependence of gating charge movement (QV) was not shifted to more negative potentials (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, measurements of intrinsic openings of the channel at negative voltages (<\u2212100mV) where the voltage sensorswere at the resting state14,42 showed that BC5 enhancedopenprobability (Fig. 3b). These results suggest thatBC5did not activate the channel by altering the voltage-dependent mechanism. Since theBC5- andMg2+-binding sites are located closely and share E399 (Fig. 2a), we examined if BC5 activates the channel via a similar mechanism as Mg2+ by modulating VSD activation36. Mg2+ activates BK channels by interacting with the voltage sensor when the VSD is at the activated conformation43\u201345, which results in a reduction of the offgating current amplitude at the endof thedepolarizing voltagepulse46. The Mg2+-VSD interaction also shifts GV relation to more negative potentials. However, Mg2+ cannot alter open probabilities at negative potentials when the VSD is not activated46, differing from the BC5 effect (Fig. 3b). UnlikeMg2+, BC5 also hadno effect on the amplitude of off-gating currents (Fig. 3a). Therefore, BC5 did not alter voltagedependent activation indirectly by amechanismsimilar to that ofMg2+. Previous studies show that Ca2+ binding also shifts the GV relation to more negative potentials and enhances open probability at negative potentials13,23. Interestingly, the amount of GV shift and the enhancement of open probability at negative voltages caused by 100 \u00b5M BC5 were comparable to those caused by 1 \u00b5MCa2+22,23, suggesting that BC5 activated the channel by specifically modulating the Ca2+-dependent mechanism.\nTo further examine the BC5 regulation of the Ca2+-dependent activation mechanism, we measured BC5 activation of BK channels at various Ca2+ concentrations. We found that Ca2+ reduced BC5 activation and the reduction was dependent on Ca2+ concentration. At 100 \u00b5M Ca2+, which saturated Ca2+-dependent activation11, BC5 no longer activated the channel (Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Fig. 6). The effect of Ca2+ on BC5 activation is specifically associated with Ca2+dependent activation of the channel, because mutations that abolished Ca2+-binding sites in the CTD for channel activation47 also abolished Ca2+ effects on BC5 activation of the channel (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 7).We studied a truncated BK channel inwhich the entireCTDwas replacedwith a short exogenous peptide, knownas the Core-MT48. The Core-MT channel was no longer activated by Ca2+ because the deletion of all Ca2+-binding sites. However, it was still activated by BC5, and 100 \u00b5M Ca2+ had no effect on BC5 activation\n(Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 8a\u2013c). These results suggest that Ca2+ competed with BC5 for activating BK channels. Ca2+-binding sites within the CTD are not spatially close to the BC5-binding site at the VSD-CTD interface (Fig. 1a), and further, BC5 activated themutant channels in which Ca2+-binding sites or the entire CTDwere eliminated (Fig. 3e, f). Therefore, BC5 likely does not interact with Ca2+ binding directly, but rather the competition between Ca2+ and BC5 is allosteric. In other words, Ca2+ binding to the channel may alter the conformation at the BC5-binding site. For BC5 to open the activation gate independently of voltage on one hand and compete with Ca2+ binding on the other hand, it may interact with themolecular pathway that couples Ca2+ binding to channel opening. That is, BC5 perturbs the pathway to promote pore opening, which can be overwhelmedby a stronger perturbation at highCa2+ concentrations due to Ca2+ binding. To further explore this idea, we performed dynamic network (Fig. 4) and information flow analysis (Supplementary Fig. 9) to examine the coupling pathway from the Ca2+-binding residue D367 to the pore lining F315. Specifically, the network was constructed in which each node represented a single residue (or BC5) and the lengths of edges captured the dynamic correlation calculated from the MD trajectories (see \u201cMethods\u201d). Nodes that were more strongly coupled would have shorter connecting edges. We then calculated a set of \u201coptimal\u201d and \u201csuboptimal\u201d paths between the selected residues, which were the shortest paths and thus the most strongly coupled49. The top 20 paths with the strongest coupling strengths are shown in Fig. 4a, b (green sticks) to illustrate the allosteric coupling pathways connecting the Ca2+-binding site (D367) to the pore residues (F315) in the same subunit and in a neighboring subunit. The Ca2+-binding site is in the CTD, while the activation gate is located in the membrane spanning domain. In both open and closed conformations, the allosteric pathway crossed these domains via twomajor branches, with one branch via the non-covalent VSD-CTD interface from\u03b1A/\u03b1B in the CTD to the S4-S5 linker/S6 in the VSD, and the other branch via the covalent C-linker to S6. To complement the pathway analysis, we analyzed the information flow50,51 between D367 (\u201csource\u201d) and F315 (\u201csink\u201d), which quantifies the contributions of all the residues to dynamic coupling. The results show that the information flow through VSD-CTD interface is higher or similar to that through the C-linker/S6 connection (Supplementary Fig. 9), suggesting that this interface is critical for the coupling between Ca2+ binding and pore opening in addition to the Clinker/S6 pathway29. Importantly, the network analysis shows that BC5 lies adjacent to the key allosteric pathways at the VSD-CTD interface, interacting with residues F395 and E399, which are part of both the BC5-binding site and the allosteric pathway in the closed structure bound with BC5 (Fig. 4a). In addition, in other closed and open structures F395 and E399 are in the vicinity of the allosteric pathway within a distanceof < 6\u00c5 (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Table 2). These results suggest that BC5 binding likely perturbs the allosteric pathway to interact with both Ca2+ binding and pore opening.\nWe performed amutational scanning of selected residues on or in the vicinity of the allosteric pathway and found that the mutation T245Wreducedwhereas E219R enhanced the sensitivity of the channel toCa2+ for activation18 (Fig. 4c, d). T245 is part of the allosteric pathway, while E219 is in the vicinity of the allosteric pathway in the open state with or without BC5 (Fig. 4b). E219 and T245 are in S4 and S5, respectively, and are downstream from BC5 in the allosteric pathway, being closer to the activation gate (Fig. 4a, b). If BC5 perturbs the allosteric pathway to activate the channel as shown above (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Fig. 9) we expected that these two mutations would alter BC5 activation as well. Indeed, similar to the effects on Ca2+dependent activation, T245W reduced BC5 activation of the channel such that BC5 shifted the GV less in themutant than in theWT channel (Fig. 4c, d), while E219R enhanced BC5 activation (Fig. 4c, d). These results support the notion that the allosteric pathway couples Ca2+ binding to pore opening (Fig. 4a, b) and that BC5 activates the channel\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:6784 5\nby perturbing the pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrate the importance of themolecular interactions at the VSD-CTD interface of BK channels in coupling Ca2+ binding to pore opening. One of the two major allosteric pathways mediating Ca2+ binding in the CTD to open the channel gate in themembrane is via the VSD-CTD interface. It is not clear where the allosteric path eventually merges with that for voltage-dependent activation. However, since both Ca2+ and BC5 can activate the channel independently of voltage13,23 (Fig. 3a, b) the allosteric path for Ca2+-dependent activation starting from Ca2+binding sites remains distinct from voltage-dependent activation at least down to the BC5 site."

Molecular docking, atomistic simulations andmutagenesis studies together suggest that BC5 binds at the CTD-VSD interface (Fig. 2), away from Ca2+-binding sites in the CTD and the pore in the membrane. Yet it not only promotes pore opening (Fig. 1d) but also interacts with Ca2+ binding such that its effect on channel activation is inhibited by Ca2+ binding (Fig. 3c\u2013f).

This pathway is built intrinsically in the BK channel protein, since BC5 still activates the Core-MTchannel (Fig. 3f), inwhich the entire CTD is removed and replaced with an exogenous short peptide, indicating that the pathway downstream from the BC5binding site is preserved despite the removal of Ca2+ sensors.\nWe found that BC5 activated BK channels by shifting the GV relation (Fig. 2f) and increasing open probability at negative voltages (Fig. 3b) to a similar extent as 1 \u00b5M Ca2+47,52. When the dependence of BK channel activation on Ca2+ was fit with the MWC model, the Ca2+binding affinity at the open state was ~1 \u00b5M47,52. Thus, BC5 activation of the channel only reached a part of the full capacity of Ca2+-dependent activation (Fig. 4d). This is not considered surprising because Ca2+ binding is coupled to pore opening via two major pathways, one is through theCTD-VSD interface,which is affectedbyBC5, and theother is through the C-linker19\u201321,27,29,30,36,38 (Fig. 4a, b). However, in our dynamic network and information flow analyses, the highest information flow residues were observed at the VSD-CTD interface (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 9). These results suggest that the pathway through the VSD-CTD interface maymakemore contributions to Ca2+dependent activation than the C-linker. However, since the maximal activation by BC5 was less than half of that by Ca2+ (Fig. 4d), BC5 interaction with the pathway may not be strong enough to even achieve the full capacity of Ca2+-dependent activation via the CTD-VSD pathway. This idea is consistent with the result that Ca2+ binding inhibited BC5 effects on channel activation (Fig. 3c, d), suggesting that the perturbation of the pathway by Ca2+ binding was stronger and overrode that by BC5.\nEach Slo1 subunit of BK channels contains two Ca2+-binding sites in the CTD41,47,53,54, and we found that Ca2+ binding to both sites shared the same CTD-VSD allosteric pathway for coupling to the pore. We measured Ca2+ effects on BC5 activation of the channel with either Ca2+-binding site removed bymutation 5D5N or D367N47. BC5 activated the channel similarly to that in the WT BK in either of these mutant channels in the absence of Ca2+. In 100 \u00b5M Ca2+ BC5 activation was not abolished as in the WT channel (Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Fig. 10), indicating that the disrupted Ca2+ binding to either of the removed site by 5D5N or D367N could no longer inhibit BC5 effects via the CTD\u2013VSD pathway. In other words, Ca2+ binding to both sites is required to inhibit BC5 activation effects. These results indicate that both Ca2+ binding sites are coupled to the activation gate via the same allosteric pathway that interacts with BC5. Since BC5 activated the 5D5N or D367N channels to a similar extent by a similar GV shift (Supplementary Fig. 10), the two Ca2+binding sites may activate the channel with a roughly equal amount via the allosteric pathway that interacts with BC5. Our dynamic pathway analysis shows that the part of the pathway downstream from the BC5 site on the VSD\u2013CTD interface to the activation gate is common to both Ca2+-binding sites, but the part of the pathway upstream from the BC5 site to the two Ca2+-binding sites diverges to connect individual Ca2+ sites (Supplementary Fig. 11).\nBC5 activated BK channels as an allosteric agonist, but it also inhibited the channel as an off-target effect (Fig. 1c\u2013e). Opposite to its activation of the channel, which was dependent on Ca2+ (Fig. 3c, d) but not on voltage (Fig. 3a, b), the inhibition by BC5 was dependent on voltage but not Ca2+ (Fig. 1f).While BC5 canbeused as an excellent tool to study Ca2+-dependent activation mechanisms, it can also be used as an effective BK channel inhibitor in physiological conditions, where the membrane voltage remains more positive than the K+ equilibrium potential so that BK channels are always inhibited. Our results revealed theCTD-VSD interface as an excellent site for allosteric agonists (Fig. 2) and the inner pore as a site for inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. 4) of BK channels. It should be noted that our current study suggests that BC5 adopts multiple binding modes in the CTD-VSD interface and most contacts are transient. Thus, further chemicalmodification of BC5may yield new compounds with more stable interactions with BK channels,\nwhichmay possess stronger allosteric activation activity. These results also suggest that potentially other sites along the allosteric pathways (Fig. 4a, b) can be used for allosteric agonists or antagonists to modulate BK channel function. These sites can be targeted for the development of therapeutic molecules to treat BK channel associated pathologies including drug therapies for BK channel associated diseases such as neurological disorders associated with either gain-offunction or loss-of-function BKmutations7 or impaired urinary bladder control11."

This strategy was previously applied to the KCNQ1 channel, resulting in the discovery of the novel channel modulators55,56. Specifically, the in silico screening method used our molecular docking softwareMDock57\u201360 as the docking engine, and each smallmolecule in a chemical librarywasdocked to a selected site on a target protein. The protein structurewas treated as a rigid body during docking and other parameters in the docking program were set as default. Then, compounds in the library were ranked by their binding scores evaluated by ITScore2 (implemented in MDock)59, which is a knowledge-based atomic pairwise scoring function derived by using a statistical mechanics-based iterative method based on a training set of experimentally determined protein\u2013ligand complex structures (a refined set of PDBbind 2012 containing 2897 protein\u2013ligand complexes61,62).\nAs for the protein structure for docking, both open (Ca2+-bound, PDB: 6v38) and closed (Ca2+-free, PDB: 6v3g) conformations of human BK channels were solved using Cryo-EM21. A major difference between these two conformations is the relative position between the membrane spanning region (S0-S6) and the cytosolic domain (CTD), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a. Because we aimed to discover chemical compounds stabilizing BK channels during their open state, the interface between the voltage sensor domain (S1-S4) and CTD was selected for the target site and the structure in the open state (PDB: 6v38) was used in the in silico screening study (see Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Because the residues interacting with Mg2+ are located at the VSD-CTD interface and were included in our target site, theMg2+ ion in the channel structurewas removedbeforedocking. The protein structurewaspreparedusingUCSFChimera63,64.Moreover, the experimental hit, BC5, was docked to both open and closed conformations of BK channels. The resulting binding modes were used as starting points for atomistic simulations.\nNext, to prepare for the chemical library in this proof-of-concept study, considering that the VSD-CTD interface contains many charged residues (e.g., K98, D99, D173, and E219 on VSD, and R342, E374, K392, and E399 on CTD), we screened a subset of the Available Chemical Database (ACD version 1999, Molecular Design Ltd., currently is a part of BIOVIA in Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, https://www.3ds.com/) in which each compound contains either one charged group (carrying a charge of +1, \u22121, +2 or \u22122) or two charged groups (with one group carrying +1 charge and one group carrying \u22121 charge). There were a total of ~4 \u00d7 104 compounds in this chemical sub-database for screening. Because accurately predicting protein\u2013ligand binding energies remains a challenging task for scoring functions in molecular docking programs64,65, current in silico screening methods are in pursuit of an enriched subset of potential candidates66,67. Therefore, we further visually inspected the docking modes of the top 2% compounds ranked by the scoring function, ITScore259. Compounds forming strong interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds or salt bridges) with both VSD and CTD in their docking modes were selected. One of the selected compounds, BC5, forms hydrogen bonds with N172 and D173 from VSD and S337 and E399 from CTD, respectively. At the end, 9 purchasable compounds (reported in Supplementary Table 3) were selected for experimental assays.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:6784 8"

In\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:6784 9\nsimulations 1-3 and 6-9, a BC5 molecule is placed in binding pocket in each of the four subunits.\nAll initial structures were first inserted inmodel POPC lipid bilayers and then solvated in TIP3P water using the CHARMM-GUI web server71. The systems were neutralized and 150mM KCl added. The final simulation boxes contain about ~900 lipid molecules and ~130,000 water molecules and other solutes, with a total of ~680,000 atoms and dimensions of ~185 \u00d7 185 \u00d7 160\u00c53. The CHARMM36m all-atom force field72 and the CHARMM36 lipid force field73 were used. The interaction parametersofBC5were thenassignedby identifying similar atom,bond, angle, and dihedral-angle types from similar small molecules within the CHARMM36m all-atom force field and CHARMM General Force Field (Charmn36cgenff)72 (see Supplementary Fig. 12). All simulations were performed using CUDA-enabled versions of Gromacs 201874,75. The default CHARMM-GUI generated configuration was used except otherwise noted here. Electrostatic interactions were described by using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm76 with a cutoff of 12 \u00c5. Van der Waals interactions were cutoff at 12\u00c5 with a smooth switching function starting at 10\u00c5. Covalent bonds to hydrogen atomswere constrainedby the SHAKE algorithm77, and the MD time step was set at 2 fs. The temperaturewasmaintainedat 298Kusing theNose-Hoover thermostat78,79. The pressure was maintained semi-isotopically at 1 bar at membrane lateral directions using the Parrinello\u2013Rahman barostat algorithm80.\nAll systemswerefirstminimized for 5000 steps using the steepest descent algorithm, followed by a series of equilibration steps where the positions of heavy atoms of the protein, BC5 and lipid were harmonically restrained per CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder protocol71. Briefly, 6 equilibration step (25 ps for steps 1\u20133, 100ps for steps 4\u20135 and 10 ns for step 6) were performed, where the restrained force constant for proteins and BC5 molecules were set to 10, 5, 2.5, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1 kcalmol\u20131 \u00c5\u22122, respectively. For lipids, the phosphorus is restrained with force constants of 2.5, 2.5, 1.0 and 0.5, 0.1 and 0.0 kcalmol\u22121 \u00c5\u22122, respectively. In the last equilibration step, only protein heavy atoms were harmonically restrained and the system was equilibrated for 10 ns under NPT (constant particle number, pressure and temperature) conditions at 298K and 1 bar. All production simulations were performed under NPT conditions at 298K and 1 bar."

Molecular illustrations were prepared using VMD81. Contact probability was calculated with MDAnalysis82. Specifically, a residue is considered to have contact with BC5 if any of its non-hydrogen atoms is found within 6\u00c5 of any heavy atoms of BC5. The results were first averaged over the four BC5 in four BK subunits, then averaged over three simulations in each condition."

For this, each residue (and BC5) is represented as a node of the network. If two residues have a contact (identified with a minimal non-hydrogen atom distance cutoff of 5 \u00c5) for greater than 75% of the simulation time, an edge connecting the two corresponding nodes is added to the network. The resulting contact matrix was weighted based on the covariance of dynamic fluctuation (Cij) calculated from the same MD trajectory as wij= \u2212log(|Cij|). The length of a possiblepathwayDijbetweendistant nodes i and j is defined as the sum of the edge weights between consecutive nodes along this path. The optimal pathway is identified as the shortest path, thus having the strongest dynamic coupling. Suboptimal paths between i and j are identified as additional top paths ranked using the path length. The analysis was performed using the Network View83. The first 20 optimal\nand suboptimal paths were selected for analysis presented in this work."

This analysis complements the dynamic pathway analysis to provide additional insights on how different residues may contribute to sensor\u2013pore coupling. For this, we first construct a network similar to the one described above. Pairwise mutual informationwas calculatedbetweennode i and j as follows:Mij =Hi +Hj \u2212Hij. Hi is calculated as 1N PN\nn= 1\u00bd ln\u03c1i\u00f0x\u00de , where \u03c1i(x) is the fluctuation density and x is the distance to the equilibrium position51. Gaussian mixture model (GMM)84 is used to estimate the density. The residue network is then defined as Aij =Cij Mij, in which Cij is the contact map. To analysis the informationflow from source (S0) to sink (SI) nodes, the network Laplacian, is calculated as L =D \u2212A, where D is diagonal degree matrix: Dii = P jAij . The information flow through a given node (residue) is defined as f i = 1 2 \u00f0 P\nj \u2223\u00f0Pi Pj\u00de\u2223Aij\u00de. The potentials P is given by P =eL 1 b, where eL 1 is inverse reduced Laplacian and b is b is the supply vector which corresponds to one unit of current entering at the source node that will exit at sink nodes. The magnitude of fi thus quantifies the contribution of residue i to dynamic coupling between the source and sink nodes."
