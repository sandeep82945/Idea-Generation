    "abstractText": "As an important forage legume with high values in feed and medicine, Melilotus albus has been widely cultivated. The AP2/ERF transcription factor has been shown to play an important regulatory role in plant drought resistance, but it has not been reported in the legume forage crop M. albus. To digger the genes of M. albus in response to drought stress, we identified and analyzed the ERF gene family of M. albus at the genome-wide level. A total of 100 MaERF genes containing a single AP2 domain sequence were identified in this study, named MaERF001 to MaERF100, and bioinformatics analysis was performed. Collinearity analysis indicated that segmental duplication may play a key role in the expansion of the M. albus ERF gene family. Cis-acting element predictions suggest that MaERF genes are involved in various hormonal responses and abiotic stresses. The expression patterns indicated that MaERFs responded to drought stress to varying degrees. Furthermore, four up-regulated ERFs (MaERF008, MaERF037, MaERF054 and MaERF058) under drought stress were overexpressed in yeast and indicated their biological functions to confer the tolerance to drought. This work will advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the drought response in M. albus. Further study of the promising potential candidate genes identified in this study will provide a valuable resource as the next step in functional genomics studies and improve the possibility of improving drought tolerance in M. albus by transgenic approaches.",

            "text": "Periodic drought is the primary limitation on plant growth and yield of crops in agricultural systems [1]. Drought-induced loss in crop yield probably exceeds losses from all other causes, since both the severity and duration of the drought stress are critical [2]. Under drought conditions, plants can resist the negative effects of harsh environments to a certain extent by mobilizing stress response genes and developing a variety of defense mechanisms at the molecular and physiological levels [3]. Transcription factors play important roles as master regulators in various biological processes and are considered to be excellent candidate genes for improving crops by genetic engineering [4]. The AP2/ERF (APETA-LA2, Ethylene Response Factor) superfamily is one of the largest transcription factor families in plants, accounting for approximately 9% of the total number of known plant transcription factor genes [5]. The AP2/ERF family of genes contains the AP2/ERF domain, which consists of 60\u201370 amino acids [6]. According to the sequence similarity and the number of domains, AP2/ERF family transcription factors can be divided into four subfamilies: ABI3/VP1 (RAV), AP2, ERF and Soloist [7]. Among them, the AP2 subfamily contains two AP2 conserved domains that are involved in the regulation of flower, ovule\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 12023. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms231912023 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 12023 2 of 18\nand seed development and the ability to maintain meristems [8]. The ERF subfamily contains an AP2/ERF domain, which functions in response to plant biotic and abiotic stresses and includes the ERF subfamily and the DREB subfamily. The RAV subfamily includes an AP2/ERF domain and a B3 domain with conserved DNA-binding domains present in other plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) [9]. In the past few decades, ERF family genes have attracted attention because overexpressing ERF genes in transgenic plants can improve abiotic stress tolerance [10]. The ERF (Ethylene Response Factor) transcription factor was first known as the ethylene response element binding protein, and according to the type of amino acids, 14 and 19 in the AP2/ERF domain, the ERF transcription factor family can be further divided into the ERF subfamily and DREB subfamily [11]. The ERF subfamily members usually bind to the GCC-box with AGCGCCC as the core sequence in ethylene-responsive genes, while DREB binds to the DRE cis-acting element with A/GCCGAC as the core sequence [12,13]. However, in recent years, more and more research has shown that ERF and DREB could simultaneously bind to GCC-box and DRE cis-acting elements [14\u201316], suggesting that the ERF and DREB subfamilies may have similar functions in different developmental stages of plants. In the past few decades, ERF family genes have attracted attention because overexpression of ERF genes could improve various abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants [10,17]. In Arabidopsis thaliana, it was reported that the AtERF1 gene responds to drought and high salt stress by combining with GCC-box and DRE elements, and overexpression of AtERF1 enhanced the tolerance to drought and salt in Arabidopsis [18]. In rice (Oryza sativa), overexpression of OsERF48 could enhance root growth and drought tolerance by regulating OsCMLI6, a calmodulin-like protein [19]. Similar reports also found that in legume, GmDREB2A and MtDREB2A could activate the expression of downstream stress-related genes and significantly enhance the tolerance to drought in soybean (Glycine max) and Medicago truncatula [20,21]. In addition, it has recently been reported that ERF transcription factors can also induce the accumulation of proline. For example, the OsERF71 gene in rice regulates the expression of proline synthesis genes under drought stress, resulting in the accumulation of proline. Under salt stress, overexpression VaERF3 of Vigna angularis increases the level of proline accumulation and improves the salt resistance in Arabidopsis [22]. M. albus is an important forage crop worldwide, and it has high economic and utilization value for the promotion of green agriculture, rural areas and sustainable agricultural production. Mainly distributed in northwest, north, and northeast China, it has the characteristics of strong vitality, wide adaptability, fast reproduction, high seed yield, and strong nitrogen fixation ability [23]. In particular, the M. albus (2n = 16) genome and transcriptome were sequenced, and the first high-quality genome was recently published [24]. The publication of this genome provides information on M. albus genotypes and permits genome-wide research on this species. However, there have not been reports of ERF genes involved in drought stress resistance in M. albus. Based on these data, we identified the MaERF gene family at the genome-wide level, analyzed their expression patterns under drought stress, and verified the function of MaERF genes under drought stress through heterologous expression in yeast. The genome-wide study of the ERF gene family in M. albus can help us understand the molecular mechanisms of its stress resistance and provide valuable clues for the functional characterization of MaERF genes in response to drought stress, which will provide genetic resources with greater resistance to stress through transgenic technology."

AP2 is characterized by\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 12023 5 of 18\ntwo conserved regions called YRG and RAYD. Regarding the AP2 domain, the structure prediction revealed three \u03b2-sheets (\u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b23) and one \u03b1-helix region that shared significant amino acid similarity within two YRG and RAYD elements (Figure S2). In addition, the AP2 domains of ERF members were highly consistent among the groups; these domains are marked with red rectangles in the figure and include the \u03b21-sheet G5 (glycine), \u03b23-sheet G31 (glycine) and A39 (alanine) site in the \u03b1-helix. The conserved motifs in AP2/ERF family proteins in M. albus were investigated using MEME, revealing a total of 25 conserved motifs (designated motifs 1\u201325), as shown in Figure 3. Proteins in the same group contain similar motifs, while the motifs are divergent among different groups. For example, motif 6 is only present in the III group, motif 22 is only present in the VI group, and motif 16 is only present in the V and VII groups of the ERF subfamily. Similarly, motifs 1 and 2 are shared by members of the AP2 family. These results indicate that most motifs are distributed among specific groups, which is correlated with their functional divergence. Subsequently, we analyzed the gene structural characteristics of these 100 MaERF genes, and the results showed that 78% of genes in this family had no introns, and only 2% of them had UTR structural characteristics (Figure 4)."

Most genes showed significant up-regulation profiles under drought treatment in roots and peaked at 3 h, such as those in A, D, G and H groups, suggesting that these genes can respond rapidly to drought stress. Genes in Group C showed significant up-regulation after drought stress and peaked at 24 h in shoots, indicating that the genes in this group were positively regulated.

            "text": "AP2/ERF transcription factors are an important family of transcription factors in all plant species that can participate in the regulation of various growth and development processes in plants and the responses to various stresses [26]. At present, many studies have confirmed that the ERF family plays an important role in the response to plant abiotic stresses [11]. However, there have been no studies on the molecular function of ERF TFs in response to abiotic stresses in M. albus. Therefore, this study focused on systematically exploring the potential molecular functions of MaERF genes under drought stress. First, we identified a total of 100 MaERF genes in M. albus (Figure S1). This result is similar to the number of genes in M. truncatula (n = 107) [27] and soybean (n=98) [28] but slightly less than that in rice (n = 139) and Arabidopsis (n = 122). In total, 100 ERF proteins were grouped into 11 different subfamilies through phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic analysis results of most of the ERF proteins were consistent with a previous report in Arabidopsis [29], which showed that the results of the phylogenetic analysis in the present study have a high degree of credibility (Figure S2). The nucleotide sequence lengths, molecular weights and theoretical isoelectric points of the MaERF genes varied. It is worth noting that all MaERF genes have good hydrophilicity, and most genes are predicted to be localized to the nucleus (Table S2), which is consistent with the fact that transcription factors regulate the transcription of downstream genes in the nucleus to adapt to changes in the external environment. In domain research, it was found that the MaERF domain contains two important regions, namely, YRG and RAYD (Figure S2). The YRG region contains 20 amino acids in the \u03b21 sheet of the AP2 domain and has been shown to play a key role in establishing direct contact with DNA molecules. In contrast, the RAYD region contains approximately 40 amino acids in the \u03b1-helical region and is involved in protein-protein interactions [30]. In addition, it has also been reported that the hydrophobic surface of the \u03b1-helix of the RAYD region interacts with the major groove of DNA [31]. Moreover, we found that gene members belonging to the same subfamily had similar motifs, and found that the motif structures of MaERF proteins in each group were highly conserved and all amino acid sequences of MaERF proteins contained a conserved AP2 motif (Figure 3). The above results are consistent with the reports of Arabidopsis, rice and soybean [29,32]. Gene structure analysis showed that the MaERF gene family had fewer introns (Figure 4). The number and distribution of introns may be linked to plant evolution, and the intron number of ERF subfamily genes has likely decreased during plant evolution [33,34], which was also confirmed in Arabidopsis and M. truncatula [27,29]. In addition, we found that gene duplication occurred in the MaERF gene family, and a total of 19 duplication events were identified. All repetitive genes show segmental duplication, indicating that segmental duplication is important to the process of gene duplication in the MaERF gene family. Meanwhile, ERF gene duplication has been found in many species, including Rosa chinensis [35] and Gossypium barbadense [36] (Figure 5). Interestingly, 18 of the MaERF genes had Ka/Ks ratios < 1, indicating that the MaERF gene family has undergone purifying rather than positive selection (Figure 6) [37]. A cis-regulatory element is a specific motif located in the promoter region of a gene that acts as a binding site for a gene and can play an important role in the stress response by regulating the transcription of downstream genes [38]. In addition, some phytohormones (abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene) are also involved in regulating the adaptive response of plants to abiotic stresses [39]. After the analysis of cis-elements in the promoter region of the candidate genes screened in the previous stage [40], it was found that the promoter elements involved in stress response and hormone response, including ABRE, LTR, MBS and TC-rich elements, exist in the promoter region of MaERF genes. These elements are involved in the ABA response and low temperature, drought and other biotic or abiotic stress defense processes (Figure 7). The results indicate that the MaERF gene promoter may play an important role in the transcriptional activation of stress response-related genes and the process of the plant stress response [41].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 12023 13 of 18\nStudies have shown that ERF transcription factors can be potential candidates for crop improvement as they are key regulators in different plant developmental processes and responses to various stresses [42]. Nevertheless, the function of the MaERF gene in M. albus is still unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the transcriptional regulation of ERF transcription factors in M. albus, in order to use them to improve the quality and abiotic stress tolerance of M. albus. Here, we first systematically analyzed the expression patterns of these genes under drought stress and determined the potential functions of MaERF genes under drought stress. We observed a significant up-regulated expression trend of MaERF genes under drought stress, implying that they may be broadly related to the regulation of M. albus in response to drought (Figure 8). In addition, the expression levels of MaERF017, MaERF037, MaERF054, and MaERF058 genes were more fold-up-regulated, suggesting that these genes may play roles in key processes. In particular, MaERF058 showed a continuous up-regulation with a 20-fold increase. Interestingly, MtERF1A (the homologous gene of MaERF058 in M. truncatula) mediates resistance to a subset of root pathogens, playing an important function in M. truncatula responding to biotic stress [43]. As previously reported, overexpression of the BrERF4 gene in Arabidopsis can improve drought and salt tolerance and overexpression of SodERF3 in tobacco significantly improved the drought and salt tolerance of transgenic tobacco [41,44]. In this study, MaERF017, MaERF037, MaERF054, and MaERF058 were validated in transgenic yeast cells, and the results showed that transgenic yeast cells grew better than empty vector yeast cells after drought resistance treatment (Figure 9). It is speculated that the drought resistance of transgenic yeast is related to the combination with the DRE/CRT (dehydration response element/C-repeat) cis-acting element (TAC-CGACAT) that can regulate the expression of a series of downstream stress response genes and functional proteins [42]. However, the specific reasons for this upregulation of these genes are still to be verified, and whether these MaERF genes can function as negative regulators in drought stress in M. albus still needs to be further investigated. The results of this study will lay a foundation for analyzing the drought resistance function of the MaERF gene family in M. albus and creating new germplasm of M. albus with high drought resistance through genetic engineering technology."

The drought stress evaluation experiment was carried out in the SC-Ura medium. We added 30% PEG-6000 stress solution to the yeast cells and added water to another group as a blank control. Afterwards, we serially diluted the 36 h-stressed culture and spotted it on SC-Ura agar plates. The spotted SC-Ura medium was placed upside down at 30 \u25e6C and observed after 48 h."

            "text": "This study explored the potential molecular function of MaERF genes in M. albus. We identified the MaERF gene family at the genome-wide level and studied the basic gene characteristics of the family. In addition, the gene structure, motif composition, phylogenetic relationship, chromosomal location, collinearity analysis, cis-regulatory elements and other characteristics of the ERF gene family were studied. At the same time, we studied the expression changes of this gene family under drought stress at the molecular level and verified the function of MaERF genes by heterologous expression in transgenic yeast. These results will enrich our knowledge of the MaERF gene family and lay a foundation for further exploration of the function of MaERF genes.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms231912023/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: The experiments were conceived and designed by W.L and J Z, Q.Z. performed seedling maintenance.
