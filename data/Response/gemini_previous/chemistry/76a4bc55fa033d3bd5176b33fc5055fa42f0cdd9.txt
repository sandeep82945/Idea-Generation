1. **Investigate the effects of different processing methods on the release and bioaccessibility of IBPs.** This could be done by comparing the content and bioactivity of IBPs in foods that have been processed using different methods, such as thermal processing, non-thermal processing, and fermentation. This information could be used to develop processing methods that maximize the release and bioaccessibility of IBPs.


2. **Study the metabolism of IBPs in the human body.** This could be done by tracking the fate of IBPs after they are consumed, using methods such as stable isotope labeling and metabolomics. This information could be used to understand how IBPs are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted, and to identify the bioactive metabolites of IBPs.


3. **Explore the potential health benefits of IBPs.** This could be done by conducting clinical trials to investigate the effects of IBPs on various health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. This information could be used to develop dietary recommendations for the consumption of IBPs.


4. **Develop new methods for the extraction and analysis of IBPs.** Current methods for the extraction and analysis of IBPs are often time-consuming and expensive. There is a need for new methods that are more efficient, cost-effective, and sensitive. This would make it easier to study IBPs and to develop new food products that are rich in IBPs.


5. **Investigate the role of IBPs in the gut microbiome.** IBPs are known to be fermented by gut microbiota, and this fermentation can produce bioactive metabolites. There is a need to study the role of IBPs in the gut microbiome and to identify the bioactive metabolites that are produced during fermentation. This information could be used to develop prebiotics and other food ingredients that promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.
