    "abstractText": "Essential oils (EOs) have good natural antioxidant and antimicrobial properties; however, their volatility, intense aroma, poor aqueous solubility, and chemical instability limit their applications in the food industry. The encapsulation of EOs in \u03b2-cyclodextrins (\u03b2-CDs) is a widely accepted strategy for enhancing EO applications. The complexation of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) with five types of \u03b2-CDs, containing different substituent groups (\u03b2-CD with primary hydroxyl, Mal-\u03b2-CD with maltosyl, CM-\u03b2-CD with carboxymethyl, HP-\u03b2-CD with hydroxypropyl, and DM-\u03b2-CD with methyl), inclusion process behaviors, volatile components, and antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the solid complexes were studied. The CEOs complexed with Mal-\u03b2-CD, CM-\u03b2-CD, and \u03b2-CD were less soluble than those complexed with DM-\u03b2-CD and HP-\u03b2-CD. Molecular docking confirmed the insertion of the cinnamaldehyde benzene ring into various \u03b2-CD cavities via hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. GC-MS analysis revealed that HP-\u03b2-CD had the greatest adaptability to cinnamaldehyde. The CEO encapsulated in \u03b2-, Mal-\u03b2-, and CM-\u03b2-CD showed lower solubility but better control-release characteristics than those encapsulated in DMand HP-\u03b2-CD, thereby increasing their antioxidant and antibacterial activities. This study demonstrated that \u03b2-, Mal-\u03b2-, and CM-\u03b2-CD were suitable alternatives for the encapsulation of CEO to preserve its antioxidant and antibacterial activities for long-time use.",

            "text": "Cinnamon, a traditional herbal medicine, belonging to the Lauraceae family, which is widely distributed in China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Madagascar, India, and the Seychelles [1]. Essential oils (EOs), which are naturally derived perfumed liquids, are the major components of cinnamon. They possess broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and excellent antioxidant ability [2]. EOs increase bacterial cell membrane permeability, which causes the leakage of ions and cytoplasmic contents, thus inhibiting the physiological activity of the bacterial cell [3]. However, CEO phytochemicals are chemically unstable, particularly cinnamaldehyde oxidative susceptibility. Moreover, the volatility, low water solubility, and intense aroma greatly limit their applications in the food industry [4]. Encapsulation is one of the most widely used techniques to overcome these limitations. Shell materials that can be used for the encapsulation of EOs include gums, chitosan, maltodextrins, starch, and proteins [5]. Among these shell materials, cyclodextrins (CDs) have been extensively used to encapsulate EOs. CDs are cyclic oligomers consisting of a-1, 4-linked D-glucopyranose units. CDs are widely used to protect flavor substances, vitamins, and natural pigments, thereby improving the physical and chemical properties of these substances. The secondary structure of a CD molecule is formed via H-bonds, which endows \u03b2-CDs with a rather rigid structure and, thus, low water solubility but\nFoods 2023, 12, 45. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12010045 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 45 2 of 19\ngood stability [6]. However, the low aqueous solubility and the nephrotoxicity of \u03b2-CDs restrict their applications [7]. The structural alterations of \u03b2-CDs including maltosyl-\u03b2cyclodextrin (Mal-\u03b2-CD), O-carboxymethyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (CM-\u03b2-CD), (2,6-di-o-methyl)\u03b2-cyclodextrin (DM-\u03b2-CD), and hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) (Figure 1) have been developed to overcome these limitations and meet market requirements (especially in the food industry).\nFoods 2022, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 19\nmaltodextrins, starch, and proteins [5]. Among these shell materials, cyclodextrins (CDs) have been extensively used to encapsulate EOs. CDs are cyclic oligomers consisting of a1, 4-linked D-glucopyranose units. CDs are widely used to protect flavor substances, vitamins, and natural pigments, thereby improving the physical and chemical properties of these substances. The secondary structure of a CD molecule is formed via H-bonds, which endows \u03b2-CDs with a rather rigid structure and, thus, low water solubility but good stability [6].

The structural al era ions of \u03b2-CDs including maltosyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (Mal-\u03b2-CD), O-carboxymethyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (CM-\u03b2-CD), (2,6-di-o-methyl)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (DM-\u03b2-CD), and hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) (Figure 1) have been developed to overcome these limitations and meet market require e ts (es ecially in the food industry).\nFigure 1. Structures of \u03b2-CD, Mal-\u03b2-CD, CM-\u03b2-CD, HP-\u03b2-CD, and DM-\u03b2-CD.\nEncapsulation in modified \u03b2-CDs affects the stability, solubility, and bioactive properties of different compounds, such as piper nigrum EO encapsulated in Mal-\u03b2-CD, thymol EOs [8] encapsulated in \u03b2-CD, rutin [9] encapsulated in CM-\u03b2-CD, citrus aurantium L. EO [10] encapsulated in HP-\u03b2-CD, and quercitrin [11] encapsulated in DM-\u03b2-CD. The tested cyclodextrins increased the solubility of these EOs and the stability of the inclusion complexes played a crucial role in their control\u2012release characteristics as well as their biological activity. However, the effect of CDs on the biological activity of EOs remains unclear. The use of \u03b2-CD and HP-\u03b2-CD for EOs has been described, whereas there are no reports on EO encapsulation using Mal-\u03b2-CD, CM-\u03b2-CD, or DM-\u03b2-CD. Kfoury et al. [12] compared the inclusion behavior of six EOs encapsulated in four types of CDs, including HP-\u03b2-CD. Samperio et al. [13] investigated the solubility of 23 plant EOs and 4 parabens encapsulated in \u03b1- and \u03b2-CD. Exploring more sources of CDs for EO encapsulation to obtain higher stability and better control\u2012release characteristic is of great interest for modulating the biological activity of EOs. In this study, we investigate the effects of aqueous solubility and stability of CDcinnamon essential oil (CEO) complexes on their antioxidant ability and antibacterial activity against food-borne bacteria and explore the potential of using new sources of \u03b2-CDs (Mal-\u03b2-CD, CM-\u03b2-CD, and DM-\u03b2-CD) in contrast to the commonly used \u03b2-CDs (\u03b2-CD and HP-\u03b2-CD) for CEO encapsulation with enhanced properties. Furthermore, we determine the differences in the volatile constituents of CEOs encapsulated in various CDs via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and examine the interaction force of inclusion via molecular docking to assess the relationship between volatile compounds and their antioxidant/antibacterial activity.\n2.

The use of \u03b2-CD and HP-\u03b2-CD for EOs has been described, whereas there are no reports on EO encapsulation using Mal-\u03b2-CD, CM-\u03b2-CD, or DM-\u03b2-CD. Kfoury et al. [12] compared the inclusion behavior of six EOs encapsulated in four types of CDs, including HP-\u03b2-CD. Samperio et al. [13] investigated the solubility of 23 plant EOs and 4 parabens encapsulated in \u03b1- and \u03b2-CD. Exploring more sources of CDs for EO encapsulation to obtain higher stability and better control-release characteristic is of great interest for modulating the biological activity of EOs. In this study, we investigate the effects of aqueous solubility and stability of CDcinnamon essential oil (CEO) complexes on their antioxidant ability and antibacterial activity against food-borne bacteria and explore the potential of using new sources of \u03b2-CDs (Mal-\u03b2-CD, CM-\u03b2-CD, and DM-\u03b2-CD) in contrast to the commonly used \u03b2-CDs (\u03b2-CD and HP-\u03b2-CD) for CEO encapsulation with enhanced properties. Furthermore, we determine the differences in the volatile constituents of CEOs encapsulated in various CDs via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and examine the interaction force of inclusion via molecular docking to assess the relationship between volatile compounds and their antioxidant/antibacterial activity."

Results and Discussion 3.1. Phase Solubility\nThe phase solubility curves of cinnamaldehyde with various modified-\u03b2-CD are presented in Figure 2.\nThe curves of DM- and HP-\u03b2-CD showed a linear relationship that is considered Atype according to Loftsson\u2019s study [24], indicating a complexation reaction in which cinnamaldehyde solubility increases as the \u03b2-CDs concentration increases. In the A-type, the inclusion complexes dissolve easily. The complexation constant (Kc) of HP-\u03b2-CD was 1059.5 mol/L. The slope of the solubility diagrams for HP-\u03b2-CD was lower than 1, indicating that the stoichiometry (HP-\u03b2-CD: cinnamaldehyde) of the complex was 1:1, whereby each molecule of cinnamaldehyde entered one molecule of CD, which could be considered an AL type profile. This can be explained as follows: Loftsson [24] pointed out that when the drug is complexed with CDs at a ratio of n:1, the inclusion isotherm is linear (AL type). When n is 1, the slope of the line can be calculated using Equation (8) and it is thus clear that the slope is lower than 1: slope = S KS K + 1 (8) where S0 is the solubility of the compound in the aqueous solution and K is the complexation constant. However, the slope of DM-\u03b2-CD was higher than 1. Loftsson [24] estimated that when n is greater than or equal to two, the slope of the AL type line is lower than n. More-\nFigure 2.

However, l e of DM-\u03b2-CD was higher than 1. Loftsson [24] estima ed that when n is greate than or equal to tw , the slope f the AL type line s lower than n. More ver, a solution exists with cyclodextrin inclusion system and surfactant micelle solubilization system, formed from the aggregation of cyclodextrin or its wrapped inclusion molecule, can also result in a slope greater than 1. It can be predicted that the ratio of complexing for cinnamaldehyde and DM-\u03b2-CD was greater than 1:1. Moreover, the inclusion complexes with an inclusion ratio of 1:1 further solubilize the cinnamaldehyde molecules in a micelle mode to form a non-inclusion complex, which can also result in a slope greater than 1 [25]. In contrast, the phase solubility curves of \u03b2-CD, Mal-\u03b2-CD, and CM-\u03b2-CD showed a nonlinear relationship, which can be interpreted as low solubility inclusion complexes (B\nFoods 2023, 12, 45 7 of 19\ntype) [26]. For Mal-\u03b2-CD, the solubility of cinnamaldehyde increased when the concentration of Mal-\u03b2-CD increased from 0 to 20 mM and then the platform reached a concentration range of 20\u201330 mM, whereas the inclusion complexes gradually precipitated. When all the guest molecules were converted into inclusion complexes, the solubility of the inclusion complexes decreased as the concentration of cyclodextrins ranged from 30 to 50 mM. The phase solubility behavior of Mal-\u03b2-CD was consistent with that of the BS type. Moreover, \u03b2-CD and CM-\u03b2-CD were considered BI types when complexed with cinnamaldehyde. As shown in Figure 2, the solubility of cinnamaldehyde was constant for \u03b2-CD and CM-\u03b2-CD as the concentration increased from 0 to 10 mM, indicating that \u03b2-CD-ICs and CM-ICs are insoluble in water. At concentrations of 10 and 15 mM for \u03b2-CD and CM-\u03b2-CD, respectively, the solubility of cinnamaldehyde began to decrease, as all the inclusion complexes were formed."

DM-\u03b2-CD exhibited the highest CEO load value. From a toxicological and economic point of view, increasing the CEO load can be advantageous for the bulk formulation and bioavailability of bioactive compounds [27].

Some small particles were still stuck to the surfaces of the large blocky solids. It can be seen that the \u03b2-CD-ICs, CM-ICs, and Mal-ICs showed irregular particles wherein the unique morphology of host molecules disappeared and loose aggregates were observed. The results are consistent with those of previous studies [28,29] and could result from the interference of guest molecules during the formation of hydrogen bonds. In contrast, HP- and DM-\u03b2-CD presented as large and plate-like solids (Figure 3G,I), whereas their corresponding inclusion complexes were compact and small aggregates. The morphological features of the modified-\u03b2-CD-ICs were entirely dissimilar from those of the modified \u03b2-CD molecules, thus confirming the successful preparation of \u03b2-CD-, Mal-, CM-, HP-, and DM-ICs.\n3.4.

The optimal binding mode between cinnamaldehyde and various modified \u03b2-CDs was calculated via molecular modeling of the host\u2012guest inclusion complexes (Figure 4). \u03b2-CD and its modified compounds encapsulated the acrolein unit of cinnamaldehyde and the aromatic ring stacked on the edge of the cavity, facilitating the formation of hydrogen bonds (yellow dashed line) with the hydroxyl group [30].

It can be seen that the \u03b2-CD-ICs, CM-ICs, and Mal-ICs showed irregular particles wherein the unique morphology of host molecules disappeared and loose aggregates were observed. The results are consistent with those of previous studies [28,29] and could result from the interference of guest molecules during the formation of hydrogen bonds.\nI c trast, - a -\u03b2-CD presented as large and plate-like solids (Figure 3G,I), t i cor esponding inclusion complexes wer compact and small aggregat s.

(E)-Cinnamaldehyde (82.31%) and 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (9.20%) were the two main components of CEO. The other components included (2-nitroprop-1-en-1-yl)-benzene (0.97%), benzaldehyde (0.86%), coumarin (0.85%), and \u03b1-pinene (0.77%). After encapsulation, eight compounds found in CEO were identified in \u03b2-CD-ICs whereas 15, 6, 9, and 26 compounds were identified in Mal-Ics, CM-Ics, HP-Ics, and DM-Ics, respectively. The main volatile components in all the inclusions were \u20ac-cinnamaldehyde and 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde. Particularly, myristic acid (9.28%), pentadecanoic acid (5.88%), and palmitic acid (21.02%) were identified as the main volatile components for \u03b2Cd-ICs; palmitic acid (2.19%), and cinnamyl acetate (1.41%) for Mal-ICs; pentadecanoic acid (3.39%), and palmitic acid (9.77%) for CM-ICs; and benzenepropanal (1.29%) for HP-ICs, and cinnamyl acetate (1.47%) for DM-ICs. A few alcohols, terpenes, and alkanes compounds in CEOs disappeared after encapsulation. The relative content of CEO after encapsulation was lower than that found before encapsulation, for example, the total terpene content in \u03b2CD-ICs, CM-ICs, and HP-ICs reduced from 3.23% to 0% after encapsulation. Furthermore, the total terpene content of Mal-ICs and DM-ICs reduced from 3.23% to 0.40% and 0.90%, respectively. The relative alcohol content of all the modified-\u03b2-CD-ICs was also reduced. However, the contents of several components increased; the benzenepropanal content of HP-ICs and DM-ICs increased from 0.64% to 1.29% and 0.83%, respectively, and the 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde content increased from 9.20% to 13.63% for Mal-ICs. This result is consistent with previous reports on encapsulation of \u03b2-CDs [35] and could be attributed to the selective encapsulation of different CEO components in cyclodextrin, in which the contents of some components decreased or increased during the embedding process. It can be noticed that DM-ICs had the most diverse chemical composition, implying that DM-\u03b2-CD is more suitable for the encapsulation of CEO. It can encapsulate the compounds of CEO as much as possible when they are lost during the preparation process. This result is consistent with the CEO load (Table 2). Moreover, of all the components, HP-\u03b2-CD was preferred to encapsulate cinnamaldehyde. The HP-ICs had the highest relative content of cinnamaldehyde for all the tested cyclodextrin, which means it has the greatest adaptability of HP-\u03b2-CD to cinnamaldehydes. This is consistent with the highest negative docking binding energy, which indicated that the combination of HP-\u03b2-CD and cinnamaldehyde had the greatest affinity and the most stable conformation. These differences in modified cyclodextrin encapsulation may be used as criteria for preparing ideal inclusion complexes. The biological activity of the EOs is primarily attributed to the presence of volatile compounds such as terpenes, alcohols, acids, esters, and aldehydes [36,37]. Therefore, changes in the volatile component content affect their antibacterial capacity. Terpenes and terpenoids are the main antibacterial compounds in EOs, followed by polyphenols [38]. They exert antibacterial activity through synergistic and additive effects with other compounds [39]. Specifically, cinnamaldehyde disturbs the interaction with bacterial cell membranes via interference in the glycerophospholipid biosynthesis pathway of foodborne pathogens [40,41] and is regarded as the main component with potent antibacterial activity. Generally, the loss of some terpene and terpenoid compounds and the reduction in the content of other compounds after encapsulation may cause a decrease in the biological performance of CEO."

These results are consistent with the antioxidant activity of HP-\u03b2-CD inclusion complexes reported by Kamimura et al. [42] and \u03b2-CD inclusion complexes reported by Santos et al. [43]. The encapsulation of EOs have weakened antioxidant activity. When encapsulated in Mal-, DM-, and CM-\u03b2-CDs, CEOs maintained similar reducing power and antioxidant activity of scavenging DPPH as free CEOs, whereas HP- and DM-\u03b2-CD maintained the antioxidant activity of scavenging PTIO. It can be noticed that CM-ICs had stronger DPPH and PTIO scavenging activities (Figure 6A,B) than CEO (after 24 h). This was probably because scavenging PTIO is a long process, which means PTIO radicals cannot be completely scavenged in a short time. CEO may decrease during the scavenging process due to its chemical instability, which means the better the protection for CEOs, the stronger scavenging effects. CM-\u03b2-CD is the best shell material to protect CEO in an aqueous solution. However, when CEO was encapsulated in HP-\u03b2-CD and \u03b2-CD, the reducing power and antioxidant activity of the DPPH scavenging were significantly reduced. The ability to scavenge PTIO was also clearly reduced when CEO was encapsulated in Mal-\u03b2-CD and \u03b2-CD. We speculate that the partial disappearance of volatile compounds and the reduction in the relative content of some CEO components after encapsulation decreased the antioxidant performance of CEO, thereby decreasing the antioxidant ability of most inclusion complexes. The CM-ICs presented an increase in reducing power and maintained the scavenging ability of PTIO, which could be\nFoods 2023, 12, 45 14 of 19\nattributed to the fact that the PTIO and FRAP assays reacted in the water-soluble system. The poor water solubility of EOs hinders their antioxidant ability. It should be pointed out that DM- and HP-ICs can dissolve in water completely, which is similar to CEO, whereas Mal-, CM-, and \u03b2-CD-ICs were partially or hardly dissolved. Therefore, the low solubility inclusion complexes presented a higher scavenging ability owing to the protection of CEO through dissolution equilibrium. With increasing reaction time, the DPPH scavenging rate of CEO saturated within 4 h. However, the DPPH scavenging rate of the modified-\u03b2-CD-ICs increased rapidly and then slowly. This suggests that the encapsulation of CEOs in CDs could scavenge DPPH in a slow and gradual process, as the liquid core materials can be constantly released into the external environment through dissolution and diffusion, which is consistent with a previous report [29]. Similarly, the PTIO scavenging rates of CEO, HP-ICs, DM-ICs, and Mal-ICs were nearly saturated within 6 h, whereas those of CM-ICs and \u03b2-CD-ICs exhibited a slowly increasing trend, indicating that the stability of the guest molecule improved during the complexing process such that they could react with PTIO completely. Notably, \u03b2-CD-ICs presented the best stable slow-release characteristics for each type of radical. These results could be attributed to the same inclusion mode (Type B) for CM-ICs and \u03b2-CD-ICs, which were in an insoluble state in the aqueous solution. Particularly, \u03b2-CD has a rather rigid structure among all the modified \u03b2-CDs [6]. The difference in the slow-release effect between DPPH and PTIO scavenging for various ICs could be attributed to the solubility of the CDs. The complete dissolution of DM- and HP-ICs caused a decrease in the slow release. Moreover, the radical scavenging of most ICs clearly increased at the end of the reaction, which was higher than that of CEO. This phenomenon could be attributed to the encapsulation effect of CDs on free radicals in the solution after a long reaction time. A study [44] has shown that \u03b2-CD can selectively bind aromatic compounds with suitable shapes and sizes to form a supramolecular system. DPPH and PTIO, which are aromatic derivative compounds, were probably partially complexed in various \u03b2-CDs during a long-time scavenging process, resulting in an increase in the scavenging rate; thus, CDs had radical scavenging capacity in appearance but no actual antioxidant effect. It can be concluded that CM-\u03b2-CD and Mal-\u03b2-CD were the most suitable shell materials in water-soluble and alcohol-soluble systems, respectively, among all the tested cyclodextrins owing to their excellent antioxidant properties and persistence in the reaction system."

Figure 7 presents the change in MIC values of CEO and CEO-modified-\u03b2-CD-ICs during the 10-day period. CEOs displayed antibacterial activity against all the tested bacteria, including Grampositive (Figure 7B) and Gram-negative (Figure 7A,C,D) bacteria in a 10-day storage period, and CEO exhibited the strongest antibacterial ability on the first day (p \u2264 0.05). The minimum MIC values of CEO were observed against S. aureus (0.087 \u00b1 0.018%, w/w), E. coli (0.11 \u00b1 0.003%), Salmonella (0.16 \u00b1 0.011%), and P. aeruginosa (0.18 \u00b1 0.021%). This result is consistent with a previous report [45] that CEO is highly effective against S. aureus. The antibacterial effect of the samples at the beginning of the period (the first day) decreased in the following order: CEO > Mal-ICs > \u03b2-CD-ICs > CM-ICs > HP-ICs > DM-ICs for E. coli, CEO > Mal-ICs > HP-ICs > CM-ICs > DM-ICs > \u03b2-CD-ICs for S. aureus, and CEO > Mal-ICs > CM-ICs > \u03b2-CD-ICs > DM-ICs > HP-ICs for Salmonella and P. aeruginosa.

Cristian [46] reported a decrease in the antibacterial capacity of coriander EO encapsulated in \u03b2-CD compared to free EO and Kfoury [47] determined that the antifungal activity of phenylpropanoids decreased after encapsulation in HP-\u03b2-CDs. However, for Mal-\u03b2-CD, CEO encapsulation maintained antimicrobial activity against E. coli, Salmonella, and P. aeruginosa, which was close to that of the free CEO. The strong antimicrobial activity of MalICs could be explained as follows: (1) as shown in Figure 2, Mal-ICs were low-solubility inclusion complexes, which were partially dissolved in nutrient broth initially for directly inhibiting bacteria and the undissolved part of Mal-ICs was fixed in agar for continued antibacterial activity; (2) as revealed by GC-MS (Table 3), the Mal-ICs contained more aldehydes, terpenes, and alcohols than the other tested cyclodextrins, which maintain the antibacterial properties of CEO as much as possible after encapsulation. With increased storage time, the antibacterial effect of CEO and modified-\u03b2-CD-ICs were significantly weakened. For E. coli, Mal-ICs demonstrated stronger antibacterial properties than CEO. For Salmonella and P. aeruginosa, Mal-ICs, CM-ICs, \u03b2-CD-ICs, and HP-ICs demonstrated stronger antibacterial properties than did CEO. Thus, the hierarchy in antibacterial capacity of modified-\u03b2-CD-ICs against E. coli, Salmonella, and P. aeruginosa (after the seventh day) was as follows: Mal-ICs > CM-ICs > \u03b2-CD-ICs > HP-ICs > DM-ICs. These results could be ascribed to the loss of volatile components of the CEO.

For E. coli, Mal-ICs demonstrated stronger antibacterial properties than CEO. For Salmonella a d P. aeruginosa, Mal-ICs, CM-ICs, \u03b2-CD-ICs, and HP-ICs demonstrat d stronger antibact ial properties than did CEO. Thus, the hierarchy in antibacterial capacity of modified-\u03b2-CD-ICs against E. coli, Salmonella, and P. aeruginosa (after th seventh day) was as f llows: M l-ICs > CM-ICs > \u03b2-CD-ICs > HP-ICs > DM-ICs. These r sults could be ascribed to the loss of volatile components of the CEO. Yang et l. [1] and Angane et al. [38] proposed that the antibacterial ability of EOs can be attributed to terpenes, alcohols, and aldehydes and that the changes in the volatile component content would affect the antibacterial properties. Additionally, the retention of volatile components was positively correlated with the antibacterial ability of EO-nanoemulsions during a 56-day storage period [48]. In this study, modified \u03b2-CD was utilized to protect the volatile constituents of CEO, consequently the strong antibacterial properties of CEO retained for a long time. The antibacterial effect of Mal-, CM-, and \u03b2-CD-ICs was much greater than that of DM- and HP-ICs. This could be attributed to the different inclusion modes in which DMand HP-ICs were completely dissolved when dispersed in a liquid medium, whereas Mal-, CM-, and \u03b2-CD-ICs were dissolved in a small amount or were even insoluble in nutrient broth. Therefore, low-solubility inclusion complexes can be uniformly dispersed in a solid medium to provide long-term and sustained antibacterial effects owing to their better slow-release properties. Moreover, for Bs and BI low-solubility inclusion complexes, the long-term antibacterial effect was positively correlated with aldehyde content as shown by GC-MS (Table 3), which played a major role in the antibacterial ability of inclusion complexes. In addition, \u03b2-CD, HP-\u03b2-CD, and DM-\u03b2-CD had symmetric structures and an\nFoods 2023, 12, 45 16 of 19\neven distribution of hydroxyl groups, leading to the formation of hydroxyl groups in the cavity to form a secondary structure and preventing reaction with the external environment. It has been reported that hydroxyl has an inevitably close relationship with antibacterial activities, which decrease or disappear after the hydroxyl group is removed [49]. For Mal-\u03b2-CD, except for the hydroxyl group in the cavity, the maltosyl branched chain outside the cavity also had hydroxyl groups that did not form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups in the cavity, thus it was free to react. For CM-\u03b2-CD, the substitution of carboxymethyl enhanced its ability to dissociate protons, which reduced the pH in cells, inhibiting the basic metabolic reactions and achieve antibacterial effects [50]. However, CEO exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against S. aureus during the 10-day storage period. It could be noticed that S. aureus is a Gram-positive bacteria, whereas E. coli, Salmonella, and P. aeruginosa are Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacterial are more susceptible to EOs than Gram-negative bacteria and this phenomenon could result from the direct interaction of the cell membrane with the hydrophobic components of EOs [51,52]. When Gram-positive bacteria are in direct contact with EOs, their membranes can combine with the EO, which causes a significant antibacterial effect. However, when EOs were encapsulated by \u03b2-CD, it was difficult for the membrane of S. aureus to directly contact the hydrophobic components of CEO, which means that it cannot show the antibacterial ability until the CEO is released slowly from the inclusion complexes. Therefore, CEO presented the strongest antibacterial effect against S. aureus during the 10-day storage period. In contrast, compared with the Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria possess a hydrophilic cell wall [53,54], and this feature is helpful for bacteria that have active contact with inclusion complexes. Therefore, Gram-negative bacteria were more easily influenced by CEO encapsulation in \u03b2-CDs and the antibacterial effect of partially modified-\u03b2-CD-ICs was stronger than that of CEO during long-term storage. It can be seen that pure CEO is more suitable to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria and Mal-\u03b2-CD is the best shell material to improve the long-term antibacterial ability of CEO against Gram-negative bacteria."

            "text": "In conclusion, this study investigated the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of CD-CEO complexes. Depending on the different solubilities of the inclusion complexes, DM-\u03b2-CD and HP-\u03b2-CD were considered A-type whereas CM-\u03b2-CD, Mal-\u03b2-CD, and \u03b2-CD were B-type. The insertion of cinnamaldehyde into all the tested \u03b2-CDs cavities possibly occurred via hydrogen binding. It was observed that Mal-\u03b2-CD, CM-\u03b2-CD, and \u03b2-CD encapsulation of CEO significantly increased their antioxidant and antibacterial activities during long-term storage. In this regard, CM-ICs steadily presented higher antioxidant activity than free CEO for long-time use and Mal-ICs showed the best antibacterial ability for long-time storage, indicating that low-solubility inclusion complexes enhanced the continued antioxidant and antibacterial capacity.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/foods12010045/s1, Figure S1.
