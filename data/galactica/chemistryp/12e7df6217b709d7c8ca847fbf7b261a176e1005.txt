A series of ammonium-based protic ionic liquids (APILs) namely ethanolammonium pentanoate [ETOHA] [C5], ethanolammonium heptanoate [ETOHA][C7], triethanolammonium pentanoate [TRIETOHA][C5], triethanolammonium heptanoate [TRIETOHA][C7], tributylammonium pentanoate [TBA][C5] and tributylammonium heptanoate [TBA][C7] was synthesized via proton transfer. Their structural confirmation and physiochemical properties namely thermal stability, phase transition, density, heat capacity (Cp) and refractive index (RI) have been determined. Specifically, [TRIETOHA] APILs have crystallization peaks ranging from −31.67 to −1.00 °C, owing to their large density values. A comparison study revealed the low Cp values of APILs in comparison to monoethanolamine (MEA) which could be advantageous for APILs to be used in CO2 separation during recyclability processes. Additionally, the performance of APILs toward CO2 absorption was investigated by using a pressure drop technique under a pressure range of 1–20 bar at 298.15 K. It was observed that [TBA][C7] recorded the highest CO2 absorption capacity with the value of 0.74 mole fraction at 20 bar. Additionally, the regeneration of [TBA] [C7] for CO2 absorption was studied. Analysis of the measured CO2 absorption data showed marginal reduction in the mole fraction of CO2 absorbed between fresh and recycled [TBA][C7] thus proving the promising potential of APILs as good liquid absorbents for CO2 removal. conclusions In this work, six APILs were successfully synthesized, characterized and utilized for CO2 absorption study. The study indicates that APILs have lower Cp value compared to commonly used MEA thus providing low energy consumption during recyclability process. Further analysis on APILs physiochemical properties also revealed that, their molar masses provide signicant effect towards Vm, V, S°, UPOT and Vf values. Other than that, it has been observed that Vf is the key factor in determining the capability of APILs in CO2 absorption in which [TBA][C7] with the largest Vf recorded the highest mole fraction of absorbed CO2. The experimental values of CO2 absorption were utilized in KH determination which in turn have revealed that the CO2 absorption in APILs is attributed by physisorption
