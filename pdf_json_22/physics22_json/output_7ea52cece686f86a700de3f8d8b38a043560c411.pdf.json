    "abstractText": "Using data samples with an integrated luminosity of 6.4 fb\u22121 collected by the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring, the process of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c6J/\u03c8 is studied. The processes of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2, \u03c7c1,c2 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 are observed with a significance of more than 10\u03c3. The \u221a s-dependent cross section of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2 is measured between 4.600 and 4.951GeV, and evidence of a resonance structure is found for the first time in the \u03c6\u03c7c2 process. We also search for the processes of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X(4140), \u03b3X(4274) and \u03b3X(4500) via the \u03b3\u03c6J/\u03c8 final state, but no obvious structures are found. The upper limits on the production cross section times the branching fraction for these processes at the 90% confidence level are reported.",

            "text": "In the past decades, several charmonium-like states with JPC = 1\u2212\u2212 have been discovered, such as the Y (4260) [1\u20133], Y (4360) [4, 5] and Y (4660) [5\u20138]. The potential model predicts five vector charmonium states in the mass region between 4.0 and 4.7 GeV/c2, namely 3S, 2D, 4S, 3D, and 5S [9]. The first three states have been identified with the \u03c8(4040), \u03c8(4160) and \u03c8(4415) [10]. Together with the three observed Y -states, we have at least six 1\u2212\u2212 states in this mass region. In addition, the masses of the undiscovered 3D and 5S states are expected to be higher than 4.4 GeV/c2, which leaves no room for Y (4260) and Y (4360) in the charmonium spectrum. Unlike the conventional 1\u2212\u2212 charmonium states which predominantly decay to open charm final states (D(\u2217)D\u0304(\u2217)), the Y -states are found to usually couple with hidden-charm final states [1\u20135]. Considering these unusual properties,\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 2\nthe Y -states are widely regarded as good candidates for unconventional hadron states, such as hybrids, tetraquarks, or meson molecules [11, 12].\nAt present, the inner structure of these Y -states remains unclear. Experimentally, the e+e\u2212 annihilation process is one of the most effective ways to probe the nature of Y -states. The Y (4660) resonance was first observed by the Belle Collaboration in e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c8(3686) process via initial-state-radiation (ISR) [5], and subsequently confirmed by the BaBar [6] and BESIII Collaborations [8] in the same process. In the Y (4660) \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c8(3686) decay, the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 system is found to be dominated by a f0(980) which has a significant ss\u0304 component. Recently, the Belle experiment reported the first Y (4626) resonance coupling to the D+s D\u2212s1(2536) + c.c. meson pair with a significance of 5.9\u03c3 [13]. Belle also reported evidence (3.4\u03c3) for a resonance with mass and width consistent with Y (4626) in the D+s D\u2217\u2212s2 (2573)+c.c. process [14]. It is not clear whether Y (4660) and Y (4626) correspond to the same resonance or not. The observation of the Y (4660) state coupling to f0(980)\u03c8(3686) and the Y (4626) state coupling to the charmed-antistrange and anticharmedstrange meson pair may indicate that Y (4660)/Y (4626) have cc\u0304ss\u0304 components [15\u201317]. In such a case, the Y (4660)/Y (4626) may also decay to the final states of \u03c6\u03c7c1 or \u03c6\u03c7c2. The BESIII experiment has measured the cross section of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2 at 4.600GeV [18], and significant \u03c7c1,c2 signals were found. With the data taken at center-of-mass (c.m.) energies up to \u221a s = 4.951 GeV at BESIII, which fully covers the Y (4626) and Y (4660) mass region, we are able to measure the cross section line shape of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2. The measurements may shed light on the inner structure of the Y (4660)/Y (4626) states and help us understand their nature.\nIn addition to the Y -states, the non-vector X-states in the \u03c6J/\u03c8 system also attract much interest. A narrow (\u0393 = 11.7 MeV) near-threshold peak around 4143 MeV/c2 in the \u03c6J/\u03c8 mass spectrum was first reported by the CDF Collaboration in the B+ \u2192 \u03c6J/\u03c8K+\nprocess with 3.8\u03c3 evidence (labeled as X(4140)) [19]. From the potential model, charmonium states within this mass region are expected to have much larger widths due to the open charm decay channels [11]. The X(4140) is therefore suggested to be a candidate of an exotic state. An updated analysis by the CDF Collaboration in 2011 [20] not only confirmed the existence of X(4140) with a 5\u03c3 observation, but also reported evidence (3.1\u03c3) of a new narrow peak near 4274 MeV/c2 in the \u03c6J/\u03c8 spectrum. Subsequent measurements were also carried out by the Belle [21], LHCb [22\u201325], CMS [26], D0 [27, 28], BaBar [29] and BESIII experiments [18, 30]. Belle [21], BaBar [29] and BESIII [18, 30] found no evidence for the X(4140). The LHCb Collaboration studied the B+ \u2192 \u03c6J/\u03c8K+ process with 0.37 fb\u22121 of data, and no evidence of resonance structures was found in the \u03c6J/\u03c8 system [22]. Later, with the full Run1 data (3 fb\u22121), an updated analysis was performed by the LHCb Collaboration with an amplitude analysis [23, 24]. A near-threshold structure with mass 4146.5\u00b14.5+4.6\u22122.8 MeV/c2 and width 83\u00b1 21+21\u221214 MeV was reported. In addition, they also reported the existence of X(4274), X(4500) and X(4700) in the \u03c6J/\u03c8 system with significance more than 5\u03c3. Most recently, with the Run1 and Run2 datasets (9 fb\u22121), LHCb improved their amplitude analysis of B+ \u2192 \u03c6J/\u03c8K+ with a new model, and a total of seven structures have been observed in the \u03c6J/\u03c8 system [25]. The abundant structures observed are candidates for exotic hadrons\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 2\ncontaining cc\u0304ss\u0304 [31\u201340], and provide new insight to exotic hadron spectroscopy. At BESIII, it is possible to search for the \u03c6J/\u03c8 structures, such as the X(4140), X(4274) and X(4500), through the e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c6J/\u03c8 process.\nIn this article, we present a study of the e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c6J/\u03c8 process with 6.4 fb\u22121 of data taken at e+e\u2212 c.m. energies from 4.600 to 4.951GeV [41\u201343]. The \u221a s-dependent cross section of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2 is measured and possible vector resonances are investigated. The \u03c7c1,c2 resonances are reconstructed with the \u03b3J/\u03c8 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 `+`\u2212 (` = e, \u00b5) decays. We also search for the possible X-state in the e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X,X \u2192 \u03c6J/\u03c8 process. To increase the number of candidates, both \u03c6\u2192 K+K\u2212 and \u03c6\u2192 K0SK0L modes are used to reconstruct \u03c6."

BESIII has collected large data samples between 2.0 and 4.951 GeV [46]. The cylindrical core of the BESIII detector covers 93% of the full solid angle and consists of a helium-based multilayer drift chamber (MDC), a plastic scintillator time-of-flight system (TOF), and a CsI(Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), which are all enclosed in a superconducting solenoidal magnet providing a 1.0 T magnetic field. The solenoid is supported by an octagonal flux-return yoke with resistive plate counter muon chamber (MUC) system interleaved with steel. The charged-particle momentum resolution at 1 GeV/c is 0.5%, and the dE/dx resolution is 6% for electrons from Bhabha scattering. The EMC measures photon energies with a resolution of 2.5% (5%) at 1GeV in the barrel (end cap) region. The time resolution in the TOF barrel region is 68 ps, while that in the end cap region was 110 ps. The end cap TOF system was upgraded in 2015 using multi-gap resistive plate chamber technology, providing a time resolution of 60 ps [47\u201349]. All the data sets with \u221a s > 4.600GeV are taken with the new end cap TOF system.\nSimulated samples produced with a geant4-based [50] Monte Carlo (MC) software, which includes the geometric description of the BESIII detector and the detector response, are used to determine detection efficiencies and to estimate backgrounds. The signal MC samples of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c6J/\u03c8 and e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X \u2192 \u03b3\u03c6J/\u03c8 are simulated at each c.m. energy point corresponding to the luminosity of data, with \u03c6\u2192 K+K\u2212, K0SK0L and J/\u03c8 \u2192 e+e\u2212, \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 being simulated according to the branching fractions taken from the Particle Data Group (PDG) [10]. The inclusive MC sample includes the production of open charm processes, the ISR production of vector charmonium(-like) states, and the continuum processes simulated with kkmc [51, 52]. The simulation models the beam energy spread and ISR in the e+e\u2212 annihilations with the generator kkmc [51, 52]. The known decay modes of charmed hadrons are modelled with evtgen [53, 54] using branching fractions taken from the PDG [10], and the remaining unknown decays are modelled with lundcharm [55, 56].

The \u03c7c1,c2 is reconstructed from \u03b3J/\u03c8, and the J/\u03c8 is reconstructed from the lepton pairs e+e\u2212 or \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212. The following event selection criteria are applied to both data and MC samples.\nCharged tracks detected in the MDC are required to be within a polar angle (\u03b8) range of |cos\u03b8| < 0.93 (the coverage of the MDC), where \u03b8 is defined with respect to the z-axis, which is the symmetry axis of the MDC. For charged tracks not used for K0S reconstruction, the distance of closest approach to the interaction point (IP) must be less than 10 cm along the z-axis, |Vz| < 10 cm, and less than 1 cm in the transverse plane, |Vxy| < 1 cm, while those for K0S reconstruction, only a loose requirement of |Vz| < 20 cm is applied. Photon candidates are identified using showers in the EMC. The deposited energy of each shower must be greater than 25MeV in the barrel region (| cos \u03b8| < 0.80) and greater than 50MeV in the end cap region (0.86 < | cos \u03b8| < 0.92). To exclude the showers that originate from charged tracks, the angle between the position of each shower in the EMC and the closest extrapolated charged track must be greater than 10 degrees. To suppress the electronic noise and the showers unrelated to the event, the difference between the EMC time and the event start time is required to be within [0, 700] ns. For each event, the lepton pair (`+`\u2212) from J/\u03c8 decays and the kaons from \u03c6 decays can be effectively distinguished by their momenta in the lab-frame. The tracks with momentum larger than 1 GeV/c are assigned as leptons, and the amount of deposited energy in the EMC is further used to separate the muons from electrons. For both muon candidates, the deposited energy in the EMC is required to be less than 0.4 GeV, while it is required to be greater than 1.0 GeV for electrons. For the tracks with momentum less than 1 GeV/c, particle identification (PID), which combines measurements of the energy deposited in the MDC (dE/dx) and the flight time in the TOF to form likelihoods L(h) (h = K,\u03c0) for each hadron h hypothesis, is used. Tracks are identified as kaons when the kaon hypothesis has a larger likelihood than the pion hypothesis (L(K) > L(\u03c0) and L(K) > 0)."

In case the signal significance is less than 3\u03c3, an upper limit of the Born cross section (\u03c3U.L.) at the 90% confidence level (C.L.) is also reported. The upper limits of \u03c6\u03c7c1 and \u03c6\u03c7c2 yields are estimated via a Bayesian approach [10]. A likelihood scan L(n) is performed with various assumptions for the number of signal events (n) in the fit. The systematic uncertainty is also considered by smearing the likelihood distribution with a Gaussian function with width equal to the systematic uncertainty. The upper limit of NU.L. at the 90% C.L. corresponds to\u222bNU.L.\n0 L(x)dx/ \u222b\u221e\n0 L(x)dx = 0.9. The detection efficiencies of \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2 events depend on the e+e\u2212 c.m. energy. With the increasing c.m. energy, charged kaons have higher momentum and are thus much more efficient to be detected, while for the K0SK0L channel, due to more ISR events the reconstruction efficiency whereas decreases (the \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212 from K0S decay already have sufficient momentum to be detected and are not sensitive to c.m. energy).\nTo investigate the \u221a s-dependent cross section line shape of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2, a maximum\nlikelihood fit is performed to the dressed cross section (\u03c3B( \u221a s) 1|1\u2212\u03a0|2 ).

Two fit models are considered: one is the single BW model, which gives \u0393e+e\u2212B[Y (4660)\u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c2] = 1.0\u00b10.1 eV with a fit quality \u03c72/d.o.f. = 21.5/12 (the dashed line in figure 6(a)), and the other is the coherent sum of a BW and PHSP model (BW + f \u221a \u03a6ei\u03c6), which gives \u0393e+e\u2212B[Y (4660)\u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c2] = 1.2\u00b1 0.4 eV with a fit quality \u03c72/d.o.f. = 17.9/10 (the dotted line in figure 6(a)). Since the fit quality with the fixed Y (4660) is close to the one with a single free BW model (\u03c72/d.o.f. = 15.9/10), we cannot distinguish between these two models.\nTo improve the fit quality, the fit model is parameterized as the coherent sum of a BW resonance and a possible continuum term (BW +Acontei\u03c6). The fit result is shown in figure 6(b), which gives\nM = (4701.8\u00b1 10.9) MeV/c2, \u0393tot = (30.5\u00b1 22.3) MeV (3.6)\nfor the resonance. The fit quality is \u03c72/d.o.f. = 7.3/7, and the significance for the resonance hypothesis is estimated using the same method, which gives 3.6\u03c3 (\u2206(\u22122 lnL) = 20.7, \u2206d.o.f. = 4).

The uncertainty of the tracking efficiency for high momentum leptons is 1% per track, and thus 2% by adding both leptons linearly [59] since we require both leptons detected. For the \u03c6\u2192 K+K\u2212 mode, both one kaon events and two kaon events are reconstructed. Assuming p (q) is the corresponding tracking efficiency for a single kaon from data (MC), the efficiency to reconstruct both one and two kaon candidates is 2p(1 \u2212 p) + p2 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)2 [1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q)2] for data (MC). Considering p \u2248 85% and the tracking efficiency uncertainty p/q \u2212 1 = 1% at BESIII, the uncertainty due to the detection of both one and two kaon candidates for the tracking efficiency can be calculated as \u2223\u2223\u22231\u2212 1\u2212(1\u2212p)21\u2212(1\u2212q)2 \u2223\u2223\u2223, which is negligible. The same calculation can be applied to the kaon PID uncertainty, which is also negligible. For the \u03c6 \u2192 K0SK0L mode, the uncertainty of tracking efficiency is 1% per pion. The uncertainty of K0S reconstruction is estimated to be 1.2% by studying the J/\u03c8 \u2192 K\u2217(892)\u00b1K\u2213 \u2192 K0S\u03c0\u00b1K\u2213 and J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6K0SK\u2213\u03c0\u00b1 control samples [60]. The uncertainty from photon reconstruction is estimated to be 1% per photon by studying the J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c10\u03c00 events [61].\nThe systematic uncertainty associated with kinematic fitting is estimated by comparing the efficiency difference with or without the helix parameters correction in MC simulations [62]. The radiative correction factor and efficiency depend on the input cross section line shape in kkmc. Using different cross section line-shapes as studied in section 3.2, the difference in (1 + \u03b4) between different models is taken as the systematic uncertainty. In the signal MC simulation, a phase space model is used. To estimate the uncertainty due to the MC model, the angular distribution of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2 is modelled by a 1\u00b1 cos2 \u03b8 distribution, and the efficiency difference is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty from the MUC response is studied with a control sample of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 events. The difference in efficiency between the data and MC simulation due to the requirement of \u00b5 hit depth in the MUC is taken as the systematic uncertainty.

The systematic uncertainty sources and their contributions (in %) for the cross section of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2 at 4.68 GeV.\nThe uncertainties related to the fit are investigated by changing the fit range and changing the background shape from a free 1st-order polynomial to a fixed flat shape with the number of events estimated from \u03c6 and J/\u03c8 sidebands. The largest difference in signal yields is taken as the systematic uncertainty.\nIn section 3, three data samples, which are the 3-track events, 4-track events with \u03c6 \u2192 K+K\u2212 and the events with \u03c6 \u2192 K0SK0L, are reconstructed. A source of systematic uncertainty can contribute differently to the three data samples. To propagate the systematic uncertainty to the cross section, we take the weighted average of the systematic uncertainties in the three data samples, which follows\n\u03c32tot = 3\u2211 i=1 \u03c92i \u03c3 2 i + 2 3\u2211 i 6=j cov(i, j), (3.7)\n\u03c9i = iBi\u22113 i=1 iBi , cov(i, j) = \u03c1ij\u03c9i\u03c9j\u03c3i\u03c3j , (3.8)\nwhere \u03c3tot is the average systematic uncertainty to the cross section as listed in table 6, \u03c9i and \u03c3i are the weight and systematic uncertainty for ith data sample, i and Bi are the efficiency and branching ratio of \u03c6 for the ith data sample, \u03c1ij is the correlation parameter between the ith and jth data samples, and \u03c1ij = 1 if the systematic uncertainty is correlated between the ith and jth data samples, otherwise \u03c1ij = 0. Assuming all these sources are independent, the total systematic uncertainty in the cross section measurement is obtained by adding them in quadrature. Table 6 summarizes all the systematic sources and their contributions at 4.68 GeV, and the systematic uncertainties at other energy points are listed in tables 13 and 14 of appendix B.\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 2"

This common uncertainty for all the data samples could shift the cross section line-shape globally, and is thus the systematic uncertainty to the mass of the resonance. In the fit to the cross section of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c2 (figure 6), a constant full width BW function is employed. We also use an alternative BW function, where the constant width is replaced by an energy dependent width \u0393( \u221a s) = \u03930 \u00b7 \u221a s\nM . Here \u03930 is the full width at\u221a s = M . The difference in the resonance parameters between the two BWs is taken as the\nsystematic uncertainty. In the fit to the cross section of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c2 (figure 6(b)), a continuum amplitude (eq. (3.3)) is used to describe the non-resonance contribution. We also use a PHSP corrected continuum amplitude (Acont \u221a \u03a6) in the fit. The difference in the resonance parameters is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The uncertainty from the cross section measurement can be divided into two parts,\none is the correlated systematic uncertainty for all the energy points, including tracking, photon reconstruction, K0S reconstruction, luminosity, branching fraction, muon hit depth, background shape, and fit range. They are propagated to \u0393e+e\u2212B(Y \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c2) directly. The other is the uncorrelated systematic uncertainty, which is dominated by the radiation correction according to the previous section. This uncertainty can be considered in the fit to the cross section. The two types of uncertainties are added in quadrature assuming they are independent.\nTables 7 and 8 summarize the sources of systematic uncertainty for the resonance parameters and their contributions, and the total systematic uncertainty is obtained by adding them in quadrature."

            "text": "In summary, with 6.4 fb\u22121 of data taken from \u221a s = 4.600 to 4.951 GeV, the process of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c6J/\u03c8 is studied at BESIII. The e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2 processes with \u03c7c1,c2 \u2192 \u03b3J/\u03c8 are observed with significances over 10\u03c3. The \u221a s-dependent Born cross sections of e+e\u2212 \u2192\n\u03c6\u03c7c1,c2 are also measured from 4.600 to 4.951 GeV. We search for potential vector Y -states in the cross section line shape of e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2, which might contain cc\u0304ss\u0304 components in their internal structure. For the e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c1 process, we find no obvious structure in the cross section line shape, and a continuum amplitude can well describe it. For the e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c7c2 process, there is an enhancement in the cross section line shape. A fit to the cross section with a single BW resonance gives M = (4672.8\u00b110.8\u00b13.9) MeV/c2 and \u0393 = (93.2\u00b119.8\u00b19.4) MeV for the mass and width of the structure. The significance of the resonance hypothesis over non-resonance hypothesis is estimated to be 3.1\u03c3. The mass and width of the resonance are consistent with the Y (4660) reported in e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212\u03c8(3686) [5\u20138]. An alternative fit to the cross section with the coherent sum of a BW and a continuum amplitude gives M = (4701.8\u00b1 10.9\u00b1 2.7) MeV/c2\nand \u0393 = (30.5 \u00b1 22.3 \u00b1 14.6) MeV for the mass and width of the structure, which has a higher mass and narrower width. The significance for the resonance hypothesis in this model is estimated to be 3.6\u03c3. However, within the current uncertainties, we are not able to distinguish whether it is the same structure as the Y (4660), and the significance for the second fit over the first one is only 2.3\u03c3. This is the first evident structure observed in the \u03c6\u03c7c2 system. We also search for a possible X-state in the \u03c6J/\u03c8 system through the radiative process e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X \u2192 \u03b3\u03c6J/\u03c8. The \u03c6J/\u03c8 spectrum can be well described by the \u03c6\u03c7c1,c2 and background events, and no other structure is evident in the M(\u03c6J/\u03c8) mass distribution. The X(4140), X(4274) and X(4500) resonances reported by the LHCb Collaboration [25] are not observed, and the upper limits on the Born cross sections for e+e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3X(4140), \u03b3X(4274), \u03b3X(4500)\u2192 \u03b3\u03c6J/\u03c8 at the 90% C.L. are determined."
