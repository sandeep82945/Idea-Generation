    "abstractText": "The activity of nucleoside and nucleotide analogs as antiviral agents requires phosphorylation by endogenous enzymes. Phosphate-substituted analogs have low bioavailability due to the presence of ionizable negatively-charged groups. To circumvent these limitations, several prodrug approaches have been proposed. Herein, we hypothesized that the conjugation or combination of the lipophilic amide bond with nucleotide-based tenofovir (TFV) (1) could improve the anti-HIV activity. During the current study, the hydroxyl group of phosphonates in TFV was conjugated with the amino group of L-alanine, L-leucine, L-valine, and glycine amino acids and other long fatty ester hydrocarbon chains to synthesize 43 derivatives. Several classes of derivatives were synthesized. The synthesized compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, IR, UV, and mass spectrometry. In addition, several of the synthesized compounds were evaluated as racemic mixtures for anti-HIV activity in vitro in a single round infection assay using TZM-bl cells at 100 ng/mL. TFV (1) was used as a positive control and inhibited HIV infection by 35%. Among all the evaluated compounds, the disubstituted heptanolyl ester alanine phosphonamidate with naphthol oleate (69), pentanolyl ester alanine phosphonamidate with phenol oleate (62), and butanolyl ester alanine phosphonamidate with naphthol oleate (87) ester conjugates of TFV were more potent than parent drug TFV with 79.0%, 76.5%, 71.5% inhibition, respectively, at 100 ng/mL. Furthermore, two fatty acyl amide conjugates of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) were synthesized and evaluated for comparative studies with TAF and TFV conjugates. Tetradecanoyl TAF conjugate 95 inhibited HIV infection by 99.6% at 100 ng/mL and showed comparable activity to TAF (97\u201399% inhibition) at 10\u2013100 ng/mL but was more potent than TAF when compared at molar concentration.",

            "text": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) is still a major global health challenge [1]. According to the Joint United Nations Programmes on HIV/AIDS statistics, in the year 2021, about 28.2 million people were accessing antiretroviral therapy. Moreover, millions of people have died from the disease. Despite the success of highly active antiretroviral therapies, the rapid emergence of drug-resistant mutants has sharply limited the clinical applications of existing anti-HIV drugs, requiring an active pipeline of new antiretrovirals [2]. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved several drugs to treat HIV infection [3]. An important limitation of antiviral drugs as therapeutic agents is, in many cases, their low oral bioavailability (less than 20%) and poor transport into cells, which in the case of nucleotide-based drugs is attributed to their ionizable groups [4]. A prodrug is a compound that undergoes a transformation within the body before eliciting its therapeutic action. The prodrug approach is extensively used to increase drug bioavailability, as well as drug targeting after oral administration [5]. This strategy is based on chemically modifying an active substance by attaching pro-moieties, which ideally overcome the biochemical and physical barriers associated with the parent compound. Limited oral bioavailability is usually attributed to poor membrane permeability, low aqueous solubility (in the gastrointestinal fluids), or extensive first-pass metabolism [6]. Several prodrug strategies have been applied to circumvent this problem in antiviral drugs (Figure 1). Tenofovir (1) (TFV) is a nucleotide analog of deoxyadenosine monophosphate. Sofosbuvir (2) is a masked phosphorylated nucleotide drug that has cell permeability and oral bioavailability against the hepatitis C virus [7]. Valacyclovir (VACV) (3) (Figure 1), the valine ester prodrug of acyclovir (ACV) targeting intestinal oligopeptide transporter 1 (PepT1), has proven to be a safe and effective drug [8\u201311]. Valganciclovir (4), an acyclic guanosine analog, was first used intravenously to treat CMV infection in AIDS patients. To circumvent the inconvenience and risks associated with frequent ganciclovir intravenous administration and its low bioavailability, an oral formulation was further developed [12]. Famciclovir (5) (Figure 1) is a prodrug of penciclovir containing acetyl diester and 6- deoxy promoieties. The prodrug is efficiently converted to the parent drug via enzymatic deacetylation and oxidation after oral administration [13]. Fosamprenavir (6) (Figure 1) is a prodrug of amprenavir and has the advantage of increased water solubility and improved oral bioavailability. This allows for a reduction in the daily dose [14]. Adefovir is an acyclic analog of deoxyadenosine. It displays low oral bioavailability compared to other acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogs due to the limited intestinal permeability of the anionic phosphonate moiety. Hence, various prodrugs of adefovir, such as adefovir dipivoxil (7) (Figure 1) were designed to mask the charged phosphonate groups and improve the oral absorption of adefovir [15,16]. Other pronucleotides include \u03b2-d-2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-\u03b1-fluoro-2\u2032-\u03b2-C-methyluridine nucleotide prodrug (PSI-7977) that has been investigated for the treatment of hepatitis C Virus [17]. Remdesivir is also among the first examples of a phosphoramidate prodrug aimed at delivering a nucleoside monophosphate into lung cells to efficiently generate the nucleoside triphosphate inhibitor of viral RNA polymerases [18]. Interestingly, many water-soluble compounds have been shown to move well across cell membranes, utilizing specialized carrier-mediated transport mechanisms [19]. These membrane transporters play a key role in determining the exposure of the cells or organisms to a variety of solutes, including nutrients and cellular byproducts, as well as drug molecules. Efforts have been made to improve drug bioavailability by conjugating different pro-moieties, targeting various active transportation systems present in the small intestine.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4447 3 of 33Molecu s 202 , 7, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 34\nP OH\nOHO O\nN\nNN\nN\nNH2\nTenofovir (TFV) (1)\nHN\nN N\nN\nO\nO\nNH2 O\nO\nNH2\nValacyclovir (3)\nHN\nN N\nN\nO\nO\nNH2 O\nO\nNH2\nValgancyclovir\nOH\n(4)\nHN\nN N\nN O\nO\nO\nO\nO\nNH2\nFamciclovir (5)\nO N S O\nO NH2P\nOH HO\nO\nO O\nO\nFosamprenavir\nHN\n(6)\nAdefovir dipivoxil\n(7)\nP O\nO\nN\nNN\nN\nNH2\nO O\nO\nO\nO\nO\nTenofovir disoproxil Fumerate (TDF)\n(8)\nP O\nO OO\nN\nNN\nN\nNH2\nO O O\nO\nO\nO\nTenofovir alafenamide (TAF)\n(9)\nNH\nO O\nP O O\nO\nN\nNN\nN\nNH2\nFigure 1. Chemical Structures of Antiviral Prodrugs.\nTenofovir (1) (TFV) (Figure 1) has activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and hepatitis B viruses (HBV) [20]. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (8) (TDF, Viread\u00ae) (Figure 1) is an ester prodrug of TFV that is hydrolyzed to TFV intracellularly, and phosphorylated to the active metabolite, TFV diphosphate. TDF is used in combination with other antiviral medications, such as 2\u2019,3\u2019-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3\u2019-thiacytidine (emtricitabine, FTC). Resistance to TDF is conferred by the reverse transcriptase (RT) K65R and/or K70E mutations. Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) (9) (Figure 1) is another prodrug of tenofovir. TAF has higher antiviral activity and distribution in the lymphatic system with fewer side effects, such as impaired kidney function [21\u201324]. All prodrugs are safe and effective and are used as part of combination therapy or for prevention [25]. With the constant emergence of HIV mutants of clinical relevance and the need to reduce the number of ARVs for chronic treatment [26], it is logical to develop new longacting and more potent nucleoside conjugates that display broad-spectrum activity against drug-resistant HIV. We previously demonstrated that several fatty acids, such as 2-methoxydodecanoic acid, 4-oxatetradecanoic acid, and 12-thioethyldodecanoic acid, reduced HIV-1 replication in acutely infected T-lymphocytes [27]. For example, 12-thioethyldodecanoic acid was moderately active (EC50 = 9.4 \u03bcM) against HIV-infected T4 lymphocytes. Protein N-myristoylation in HIV-1 is catalyzed by NMT, which is inhibited by myristic acid derivatives. Myristoylated proteins include PR160gag-pol, Pr55gag, p17gag, and p27nef proteins of HIV-1 [28]. Furthermore, fatty acyl derivatives of 3-fluoro-2\u2032,3\u2032dideoxythymidine (FLT), 3\u2032-azido-2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxythymidine (AZT) [29], 2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydro2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxythymidine (d4T) [30], FTC [31], and 3TC [32] exhibited a significantly higher cellular uptake and anti-HIV profile against wild-type cell-free, cell-associated, and resistant viruses when compared with the corresponding parent nucleosides. The fatty acids were found to also have modest anti-HBV activity [33]. For example, myristic acid conjugate of FTC (IC90 = 15.7\u201316.1 nM) exhibited 6.6- and 35.2 times higher activity than FTC (IC90 = 103\u2013567 nM) against multidrug-resistant viruses B-NNRTI and B-K65R, indicating\nO\nO HN\nP O\nO\nO O\nHO F\nNH N O\nO\nSofosbuvir (2)\nFigure 1.

The fatty acyl conjugation changes the uptake, activity profile, and mechanism of activity, presumably by interfering with the posttranslational myristoylation of proteins in the HIV life cycle. Intracellular hydrolysis to the parent nucleoside is one of the factors that contribute to overall anti-HIV activity. Based on these reports, we hypothesized that the modification of the nucleotide-based TFV conjugated with different amino acids and fatty acids would improve its lipophilicity, thereby leading to improved anti-HIV activity. Thus, several mono- and disubstituted classes of fatty ester conjugates of TFV were synthesized and evaluated for HIV inhibition. The design of compounds was based on generating diversity in the phosphonate group by conjugating different amino acids, alcohol, phenols, naphthols, and fatty acids. The synthesis of compounds consists of L-alanine monosubstituted phosphonamidate derivatives (16\u201320), L-leucine monosubstituted phosphonamidate derivatives (26\u201328), L-alanine disubstituted esters (32\u201334, and 36), phosphonadiamidate (35, 37, and 38), phosphonamidate ester derivatives (39\u201346), L-alanine 2-pentanolyl ester substituted phosphonamidate esters (52\u201354), and diester derivatives of phenolated and naphtholated TFV (56\u201363), Lalanine 2-heptanolyl substituted phosphonamidate ester (68), diester derivatives of naphtholated TFV (69), L-alanine 1-butanolyl substituted phosphonamidate ester (74), and diester derivatives of phenolated TFV (75\u201377), L-valine 1-butanolyl substituted phosphonamidate ester (84), diester derivatives of phenolated and naphtholated TFV (84\u201387), and glycine1-butanolyl phosphonamidate diester derivatives of phenolated TFV (94) (Figure 2). Alternatively, tetradecanoyl and 12-azidododecanoyl amide conjugates of TAF (95 and 96) (Figure 3) were synthesized for comparative studies with TAF and TFV conjugates. All compounds containing the stereocenter at phosphorus were evaluated as racemic mixtures. It is worth emphasizing that this work was a preliminary study to screen and identify lead compounds and templates and develop the structure\u2013activity relationship. Further optimization, biostability, and in vivo work are planned in future studies and are beyond the scope of this manuscript.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4447 5 of 33Molecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 34\nP OH\nOHO O\nN\nNN\nN\nNH2\n1\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO R\nNH2\nOH 16-20\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO R\nNH2\nOH 26-28\n32-34\nN\nN\nN N\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nN H O\nR O\nN\nN\nN N\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nN H NH2\n36\n68\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\n69\nO R\nO\n(16) R = -CH(CH 3)CH2CH3 (17) R = -CH(CH 3)CH2CH2CH3 (18) R = -CH(CH 3CH2)2 (19)\nR = CH3CH(CH=CH2) (20) R = -C(CH3)3\n(26) R = -CH 2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 (27) R = -CH2CH=CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH=CH(CH3)2\n(28) R =\n(32) R = -CH 2CH2CH2CH3 (33) R = -CH(CH 3)CH2CH2CH3 (34) R = -CH 2CH2CH2CH2(OCH3)\nR = CH3(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7 -\nZ\nO\nO\nO OH\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nOH\nE E\nN\nN\nN N\nO P N O\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nO R\nO\n39-41, 46\n(39) R = (CH3(CH2)16 -,\n(40) R = CH3(CH2)14-, (41) R = CH3(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7-, (46) R =N 3(CH2)10 -Z\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nO R\nO\n42-45\nZ\n(42) R =N 3(CH2)10 - (43) R = CH3(CH2)14-, (44) R = (CH3(CH2)16 -, (45) R = CH3(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7 -\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nO R\nO\nN\nN\nN N\nO P N O\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nOH\n52\n(56) R = CH3(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7 - (57) R = N3(CH2)10-, Z\nFatty acids\nN\nN\nN N\nO P N O\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nOH\n53\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nO R\nO\n(58) R = CH3(CH2)13CH2 -, (59) R = CH3(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7 - (60) R = N3(CH2)10-, Z\nFatty acids\nN\nN\nN N\nO P N O\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\n54\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nOH\nO O\nR\n(61) R = CH3(CH2)15CH2 -, (62) R = CH3(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7 - (63) R = N3(CH2)10-, Z\nFatty acidsFatty acid\nFatty acids\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\n74 (a) N\nN\nN N\nO P N O\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO O R\nO\n(75) R = CH3(CH2)14 -, (76) R = N3(CH2)10-,\nHO\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\n74 (b)\nOH\n(77) R = CH3(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7 -\nZ\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nO\nR\nO\nFatty acid\nf\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nN\nN\nN N\nO P N O\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nOH\n83(a)\nO\n(84) R = CH3(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7 -\nZ\nO\nR\nFatty acid\nN\nN\nN N\nO P N O\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nOHN\nN\nN N\nO P N O\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nO R\nO\n(85) R = CH3(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7 - (86) R = N3(CH2)10-,\n(87) R = CH3(CH2)7-CH=CH-(CH2)7 -\nZ\nZ\n83(b)\n83(c)\nOH\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nO R\nO\nFatty acid\nFatty acid\n94\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nOH\nN\nN N\nN\nO P\nN\nO\nH\nO\nO\nNH2\nO\nO\nO 7 7\nFigure 2.

Synthesis of L-leucine monosubstituted phosphonamidate derivatives of TFV.\nFigure 1 shows the chemical structures of phosphondiamidate and phosphonamidite ester derivatives of TFV. Phosphondiamidate derivatives of TFV (32\u201334) were synthesized, as depicted in Scheme 3. The NH2 group of L-alanine 10 was protected with BOC (11) in the presence of NaHCO3 and H2O/THF (1:1 v/v), as described above, to afford NBoc-protected amino acid 12 that was further esterified with different alcohols (1-butanol, 2-pentanol, and 4-methoxy-1-butanol, 29a\u2013c) in the presence of thionyl chloride and chloroform (used as a solvent) to obtain the protected amino esters 30a\u2013c. The protected amino ester was deprotected with trifluoracetic acid in the presence of methanol to form amino esters 31a\u2013c. Further reaction of 31a\u2013c with compound 20 in the presence of thionyl chloride afforded compounds 32\u201334. Phosphondiamidate 36 and phosphonamidate esters 35 and 37 were synthesized by the reaction of compound 20 with phenol, ethane diamine, and naphthol in the presence of thionyl chloride and chloroform. A library of phosphonamidate ester derivatives of TFV was prepared via the reaction of compound 20 with substituted phenols (1,3-dihydroxybenzene and 1,4-dihydroxybenzene). The reaction was performed in chloroform (used as a solvent) in the presence of thionyl chloride. The precipitates were formed, which were filtered to afford the intermediate product 38 that was further substituted with different fatty acids (stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and 11-azidoundecanoic acid) in the presence of thionyl chloride and chloroform (used as a solvent) to afford fatty ester derivatives of amino esters of TFV (39\u201346, Scheme 3). The chemical structures of all synthetic compounds were elucidated by different spectroscopic techniques, such as ESI-MS, HR-ESI-MS, 1H NMR, UV, I.R., and/or 13C NMR, COSY, NOESY, and HMBC.\nSche e 2.

Other conjugates, 33\nand 34, showed significantly less inhibitory activity (5.0\u201311.7%), suggesting that having\ntwo phosphonamidates does not confer improved HIV inhibitory activity as compared to\nTFV (1), presumably due to the limited hydrolysis of the amidate linkage. tert-Butyl ala-\nnine disubstituted phosphonamidate ester derivatives (35 and 37\u201346) exhibited 0\u201325.8.%\ninhibition, with compounds 39 and 40 showing the highest inhibition. These data suggest\nthat no dramatic improvement of inhibitory activity was shown by tert-butyl alanine\nphosphonamidate ester or phosphondiamidate derivatives.

The only difference between these two\ncompounds was the presence of tert-butyl alanine phosphonamidate in compound 42, and\nn-butanolyl alanine phosphonamidate in compound 76. Comparable activity was ob-\nserved in compound 61 (39.7%) with a long fatty ester chain at the meta position of phe-\nnolate ring, and 2-pentanolyl alanine phosphonamidate. However, less activity was ob-\nserved with compound 32 (15%) with butyl alanine and tert-butyl alanine phosophdi-\namidate.

Among the disubstituted conjugates, i.e., tert-butyl alanine subst uted phosphondiamidates (32\u201334), compound 32 (15%) showed less activity to TFV.

Less activity t TFV (1) was shown by compounds 42 (10.2%) and 76 (18.5%), both containing the same long fatty ester 11-azidoundecanoyl chain at the meta position. The only difference between these two compounds was the presence of tert-butyl alanine phosphonamidate in compound 42, and n-butanolyl alanine phosphonamidate in compound 76. Comparable activity was observed in compound 61 (39.7%) with a long fatty ester chain at the meta position of phenolate ring, and 2-pentanolyl alanine phosphonamidate.

These data indicate that the size and nature of the substituents contribute to the anti-HIV activity, possibly due to an alteration in the rate of uptake and differential release profile of the compounds. Selected 2-pentanolyl alanine phosphonamidate ester conjugates of TFV (52\u201363) showed more diverse anti-HIV activities depending on the substituents. Meta and para-substituted 11-azidoundecanoyl phenolate conjugates 60 (42.5%) and 63 (58%) exhibited higher in-\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4447 15 of 33\nhibitory activity than TFV. The only difference between compounds 60 and 63 was the presence of the 11-azidoundecanoyl long chain group chain at para position rather than meta. Both compounds have 2-pentanolyl alanine phosphonamidite. Meta oleic acid phenolate conjugate 62 (76.5%) was 2.2-fold more potent than TFV, while the same fatty acid on naphthol conjugate 56 (40.6%) showed slightly higher activity, although 57 (4.6%) was less effective. The absence of fatty acyl esters on naphthol or phenol in compounds 52\u201354 (no inhibition to 35.1%) or the presence of another type of fatty acid in compound 61 (39.7%) impaired or did not significantly change the antiviral activity. Compound 59 with oleic acid on the para position of phenolate demonstrated a complete loss of activity when compared with meta-substituted oleic phenolate conjugate 62 (76.5%). These data suggest that the nature and position of the fatty acid contribute significantly to the anti-HIV activity, presumably due to changes in cellular uptake and release. Changing the 2-pentanolyl in compound 56 (40.6%) to 3-heptanolyl in compound 69 (79%), significantly enhanced the anti-HIV activity by 2.3-fold, making it more potent than TFV (1). This suggested that the nature of ester substitution on the alanine is critical for generating compounds with higher anti-HIV activity. The corresponding butanolylsubstituted naphtholated conjugate 77 showed no activity. The importance of alkyl ester substitution was also obvious when comparing compounds 84 (24.3%) and 62 (76.5%), with the only difference being the presence of butyl instead of a pentyl phenolated ester. In general, 2-butanolyl alanine conjugates were less active than the corresponding 2-pentanyl alanine conjugates, as observed for compounds 75 (22.1%), 61 (39.7%), 76 (18.5%) and 60 (42.5%), 77 (no inhibition), and 56 (40.6%). 2-Butanolyl ester valine naphtholated conjugate 87 (71.5%) was more potent than the corresponding butanoyl ester alanine naphtholated conjugate 77 (no inhibition%), but less active than 3-heptanoyl ester alanine naphtholated conjugate 69 (79%), suggesting that the selection of the amino acid, substituted ester on the amino acid and the fatty acid ester on the naphtholated conjugate are critical for optimal activity. Compound 87 with a long oleic acid ester chain at the para position of the naphthol ring and butyl-substituted valine attached similarly to phosphonamidite inhibited the HIV infection by 71.5% at 100 ng/mL. 2-Butyl glycine conjugate 94 (no inhibition) was not potent as compared to the corresponding isoleucine conjugate 85 (11.4%). Among all the selected compounds, compounds 62, 69, and 87 (Figure 6 and Table S1, Supplementary Materials), demonstrated higher HIV inhibition than TFV (1). Compound 69 significantly inhibited HIV infection by 79.0% at 100 ng/mL. The compound contains a long hydrocarbon chain of oleic acid with a double bond at para position of the naphthol ring and 3-heptanoyl-substituted alanine on the phosphonamidate (Figure 7). A slight decrease in activity was observed in compound 62 (76.5% inhibition) when the oleate ester was positioned at meta position of the phenolate ring, and 2-pentanolyl alanine was attached as phosphonamidate (Figure 7). The compound was still more potent than the parent drug TFV (1). Compounds 56 (40.6%), 60 (42.5%), 63 (58.0%), and 93 (58.0%) (Figure 7) also exhibited slightly higher activity than TFV.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4447 16 of 33Molecules 202 , 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 34\nFigure 7. Chemical structures of selected screened compounds against HIV with higher activity than TFV.\nFor the TAF conjugates 95, 96, and 97 the inhibitory activity was more than 99% at\n100 ng/mL and was comparable to TAF (Figure 8 and Table S2, Supplementary Materials).\nIndeed, compound 95 exhibited 99.6% inhibition at a lower molar concentration of 0.145\n\u00b5M (100 ng/mL) vs. 0.210 \u00b5M (100 ng/mL) for TAF (9). Thus, lower concentrations (10, 1,\n0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 ng/mL) were examined. Among these two compounds (95 and 96) and\nthe physical mixture (97), tetradecanoyl conjugate of TAF (95) was found to be signifi-\ncantly more potent. Tetradecanoyl conjugate 95 showed 98.4%, 70.9%, and 33% inhibition\nvs. the corresponding physical mixture of myristic acid and TAF, which showed 91.7%,\n60.4%, and 27.9% inhibition at concentrations of 10, 1, and 0.1 ng/mL, respectively. Fur-\nthermore, compound 95 showed a comparable 98.4% inhibition at a lower molar concen-\ntration of 0.0145 \u00b5M (10 ng/mL) vs. 0.021 \u00b5M (10 ng/mL) for TAF. These data indicate the\nimportance of conjugation in improving anti-HIV activity. Compound 95 generated com-\nparable anti-HIV activity (~99% inhibition) to TAF at lower molar concentrations, suggest-\ning higher potency for the fatty acyl conjugated TAF. We previously observed that fatty\nacyl conjugates of FTC demonstrated higher potency against the resistant virus when\ncompared with the parent FTC [26]. Further investigations are required to determine\nwhether the fatty acyl conjugation of TAF can enhance the long-acting anti-HIV activity\nand potency against the TFV-resistant virus in a similar way. Further optimization, bio-\nstability, and in vivo characterization are needed to determine the biological relevance\nand added value of these conjugates.\nFigure 7.

Among thes two compounds (95 and 96) and the physical mixture (97), tetradecanoyl conjugate of TAF (95) was found to be significantly more p tent. T trad canoyl conjugate 95 showed 98.4%, 70.9%, and 33% inhibition vs. the corr sponding physical mixture of myristic acid and TAF, which s owed 91.7%, 60.4%, and 27.9% inhibition at c centratio s of 10, 1, and 0.1 ng/mL, respectively. Furthermore, co pound 95 showed a c mparable 98.4% inhibitio at a l wer m lar concentration of 0.0145 \u00b5M (10 ng/mL) vs. 0.021 \u00b5M (10 ng/mL) for TAF. These data indicate the importance of conjugation in improving anti-HIV activity. Compound 95 generated comparable antiHIV activity (~99% inhibition) to TAF at lower molar concentrations, suggesting higher potency for the fatty acyl conjugated TAF. We previously observed that fatty acyl conjugates of FTC demonstrated higher potency against the resistant virus when compared with the parent FTC [26]. Further investigations are required to determine whether the fatty acyl conjugation of TAF can enhance the long-acting anti-HIV activity and potency against the TFV-resistant virus in a similar way. Further optimization, biostability, and in vivo characterization are needed to determine the biological relevance and added value of these conjugates.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4447 17 of 33 Molecules 2022, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 34\ntion methods.

            "text": "Several classes of amino esters conjugates of TFV (1) were synthesized. Three compounds 62, 69, and 87 showed higher potency than TFV (1), while others showed comparable or lower activity. Compound 69 significantly inhibited HIV infection by 79.0% at 100 ng/mL, and was about 2.2-fold more active than TFV. Compound 69 contains a long hydrocarbon chain of oleic acid with a double bond at para position of the naphthol ring and 3-heptyl-substituted alanine on the phosphonamidate. Comparable or slightly lower anti-HIV activity was obtained for compounds 62 and 87 with similar structural features. Due to its chemical modification and inferred physicochemical properties, we speculate that this compound would be better suited than TFV as a long-acting formulation. In this study, the data revealed that the nature of the amino acid on phosphonamidate, the size of the alkyl ester moiety on the amino acid, and the presence of a specific fatty acid on the phenolate or naphtholate ester within the nucleotide-based compound are key features underpinning their performance. Furthermore, fatty acyl amide conjugation generated compounds with comparable activity to TAF. Thus, this strategy may be used to improve the anti-HIV activity of TFV. This work represents a preliminary study to show the proof of concept. However, more research is needed based on the identified templates for the optimization and development of long-acting TFV-based anti-HIV agents. The most potent compounds will be further evaluated in vivo to determine their potential application as long-acting antiretrovirals.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/ 10.3390/molecules27144447/s1.
