    "abstractText": "The Thouless pump is a phenomenon in which U(1) charges are pumped from an edge of a fermionic system to another edge. The Thouless pump has been generalized in various dimensions and for various charges. In this paper, we investigate the generalized Thouless pumps of fermion parity in both trivial and non-trivial phases of 1 + 1-dimensional interacting fermionic short-range entangled (SRE) states. For this purpose, we use matrix product states (MPSs). MPSs describe many-body systems in 1 + 1-dimensions and can characterize SRE states algebraically. We prove fundamental theorems for fermionic MPSs (fMPSs) and use them to investigate the generalized Thouless pumps. We construct non-trivial pumps in both the trivial and non-trivial phases and we show the stability of the pumps against interactions. Furthermore, we define topological invariants for the generalized Thouless pumps in terms of fMPSs and establish consistency with existing results. These are invariants of the family of SRE states that are not captured by the higher dimensional Berry curvature. We also argue a relation between the topological invariants of the generalized Thouless pump and the twist of the K-theory in the Donovan-Karoubi formulation.",

The Thouless pump has been generalized in various dimensions and for various charges. In this paper, we investigate the generalized Thouless pumps of fermion parity in both trivial and non-trivial phases of 1 + 1-dimensional interacting fermionic short-range entangled (SRE) states. For this purpose, we use matrix product states (MPSs). MPSs describe many-body systems in 1 + 1-dimensions and can characterize SRE states algebraically. We prove fundamental theorems for fermionic MPSs (fMPSs) and use them to investigate the generalized Thouless pumps. We construct non-trivial pumps in both the trivial and non-trivial phases and we show the stability of the pumps against interactions. Furthermore, we define topological invariants for the generalized Thouless pumps in terms of fMPSs and establish consistency with existing results. These are invariants of the family of SRE states that are not captured by the higher dimensional Berry curvature. We also argue a relation between the topological invariants of the generalized Thouless pump and the twist of the K-theory in the Donovan-Karoubi formulation.\nCONTENTS\nI. Introduction 2 A.

Kitaev\u2019s Argument and the Kitaev Pump\nA short-range entangled (SRE) state is a unique gapped ground state for a system without a boundary. An integer quantum Hall state is a representative example of 2 + 1-dimensional SRE states. To date, SRE states with various symmetries in various dimensions have been discovered, which include physically important systems such as topological insulators and topological superconductors [1\u20133].\n3 A remarkable property of SRE states is invertibility: Any SRE state |\u03c7\u3009 in d + 1 space-time dimensions has an anti-SRE state |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 that satisfies\n|\u03c7\u3009d+1 \u2297 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009d+1 \u223c |0\u3009d+1 \u2297 |0\u3009d+1 \u223c |\u03c7\u0304\u3009d+1 \u2297 |\u03c7\u3009d+1 . (1) Here \u223c represents a continuous deformation keeping a gap and symmetry, and |0\u3009d+1 is the trivial state in d+ 1-dimensions 1. Because of the invertibility, SRE states are often called as invertible states.\nA fundamental question for SRE states is what a kind of quantum phases and the related phenomena they deliver for fixed space-time dimensions and symmetry. Let MGd+1 be the set of all d + 1-dimensional SRE states with symmetry G. The first step to answer the question is the identification of connected components \u03c00 ( MGd+1 ) of MGd+1: Each connected component in \u03c00 ( MGd+1 ) specifies a possible symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase (See Fig. 1). Importantly, we can also consider a more complicated topology in MGd+1, such as the fundamental group\n\u03c01 ( MGd+1 ) . In associated with this, Kitaev considered a loop in MGd+1 that gives a non-trivial topological phenomenon [4]. Following his argument, let us start with a d + 1-dimensional trivial state |0\u3009d+1 obtained by arranging the (d\u2212 1) + 1-dimensional trivial states |0\u3009(d\u22121)+1 in a line.\n|0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 . Then, choosing an arbitrary (d\u22121)+1-dimensional SRE state |\u03c7\u3009, we perform the deformation |0\u3009 |0\u3009 \u223c |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 on neighboring trivial states:\n|\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009\u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 ,\nwhere \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 is the continuous deformation in Eq.(1). Finally, by accomplishing the reverse transformation\n|\u03c7\u0304\u3009 |\u03c7\u3009 \u223c |0\u3009 |0\u3009 for neighboring states shifted by one site, we obtain again the d+ 1-dimensional trivial state. This process defines a loop inMGd+1 that starts from the d+ 1-dimensional trivial state and returns to itself, and interestingly, if the system has a boundary, the same process pumps (d\u2212 1) + 1-dimensional SRE states at the boundary, as shown below.\n|\u03c7\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009\u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009\u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 .\nThis is a generalization of the Thouless pump that pumps the U(1) charge by a periodic change of a potential [5]. This Kitaev\u2019s pump 2 applies to any SRE states in arbitrary dimensions with any symmetry.\nWhereas the above procedure only provides an injective map from a (d \u2212 1) + 1-dimensional SRE state to a loop of d+ 1-dimensional SRE states, Kitaev conjectured that this correspondence is one-to-one (up to homotopy),\nMG(d\u22121)+1 \u223c \u2126M G d+1, (2)\nwhere \u2126MGd+1 is the based loop space of MGd+1 :\n\u2126MGd+1 := {\u03b3 : [0, 1]\u2192MGd+1 | \u03b3(0) = \u03b3(1) = |0\u3009d+1}. (3)\nMathematically, this means that {MGd }d\u2208Z is an \u2126-spectrum with the base point {|0\u3009d}d\u2208Z. This conjecture is important because this implies that a generalized cohomology theory works for the classification of SRE states [6].\n1 We often omit the space-time dimension when it is clear from the context. 2 In the following, we call this pump as Kitaev\u2019s canonical pump.\n4 B. Summery of This Paper\nAs discussed above, the space of SRE statesMGd+1 determines both SPT phases and generalized Thouless pumps. On the basis of K-theory, previous researches specify MGd+1 for free fermionic SRE states, i.e. fermionic SRE states with quadratic Hamiltonians, with G on-site symmetry [7\u20139]. The classification of the free fermionic SRE states has been done both from field theory and lattice Hamiltonian perspectives. On the other hand, for interacting fermionic SRE states, it is difficult to determine MGd+1, in particular, in lattice Hamiltonian formalism.\nIn this paper, using fermionic matrix product states (fMPSs), we analyze the space M1+1 with fermion parity symmetry, in the presence of interactions. We establish the existence of non-trivial pumps both in the trivial (orange loop in Fig. 1) and the non-trivial SPT phases (blue loop in Fig. 1).\nWhile the Kitaev\u2019s (and the original Thouless) pump is a pump in the trivial SPT phase as explained in the above, pumps in the non-trivial SPT phase also have been studied, especially in free fermionic systems [9\u201311].3 Pumps in our analysis are consistent with these previous studies. We also present the topological invariants that characterize pumps both in trivial and non-trivial SPT phases in terms of fMPSs, and check the validity of them for several interacting models. We also give a geometric interpretation of the topological invariants.\nC. Outlook of This Paper\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II, we give a quick review of the free Kitaev chain as the simplest example of fermionic SRE states in 1+1 dimensions (Sec.II A). This model hosts two SPT phases: the trivial phase and the non-trivial phase, and shows a pump of the fermion parity both in the trivial and non-trivial phases. We explain the fermion parity pump of the Kitaev chain in the trivial (Sec.II B) and non-trivial (Sec.II C) phase from several perspectives.\nIn Sec.III, we introduce MPSs of bosonic (Sec.III A) and fermionic systems (Sec.III B) and identify several MPSs of bosonic and fermionic models. In particular, we characterize SRE states by an algebraic property of MPSs called an injective MPS, where the (Z/2Z-graded) central simplicity of the algebra generated by matrices of MPSs plays a crucial role [12]. We also illustrate this by using concrete examples. (We give a review of (Z/2Z-graded) central simple algebra in Appendix A.) In addition, we provide the necessary and sufficient condition for two injective fMPSs to give the same SRE state and summarize the condition in the form of Theorems 3 and 4.\nIn Sec.IV, we specify the space of the fMPS with the small matrix sizes and we reveal the existence of a non-contractible loop giving a pump in the non-trivial phase.\n3 In the following, we collectively refer all of the above pumps as generalized Thouless pump and, in particular, we call the pump in the trivial phase the Kitaev pump.\n5 In Sec.V, we present a general theory to construct topological invariants for pumps in 1+1 dimensional fermionic SRE states in the formulation of fMPSs. Our construction is based on the Wall\u2019s structure theorem and works both in trivial and non-trivial phases. For the trivial phase, fMPSs are similar to bosonic MPSs, and our construction is consistent with that for bosonic MPSs proposed in Ref.[13] (Sec.V A). On the other hand, our topological invariant in the non-trivial phase is essentially new since the non-trivial phase appears only in the fermionic case (Sec.V B). We also give geometric interpretations of the topological invariants (Sec.V C).\nIn Sec.VI, we apply our general theory of the pump topological invariants in Sec.V to several interacting fermionic models. We evaluate the topological invariants of pumps in trivial (Sec.VI A) and non-trivial (Sec.VI B) phases and clarify the robustness of pumps in the presence of interactions.\nPrior works are listed here. Adiabatic pumps in SRE states have been discussed in the context of the Floquet SPT phase [14\u201317], where the periodic unitary time evolution which can be stroboscopic is studied. Studies focusing more on adiabatic pumps in SRE states/Hamiltonians themselves include bosonic systems with onsite symmetry [13, 18], multiple adiabatic parameters [19\u201322], and topological ordered states [23].\nII. GENERALIZED THOULESS PUMP IN SHORT-RANGE ENTANGLE STATES IN KITAEV CHAIN\nSRE states provide the simplest class of topological phases. They are characterized by (a) the existence of global symmetry, (b) the uniqueness of the ground state, and (c) the existence of a finite energy gap. Despite their simplicity, SRE states describe many physically important systems, such as topological insulators and superconductors, and the Haldane chain, and so on.\nIn this section, we examine pump phenomena via the free Kitaev chain. In Sec.II A, we first review the Kitaev chain as an example of 1 + 1-dimensional SRE states. In Sec.II B and Sec.II C, we investigate pumps in the the free Kitaev chain for the trivial and non-trivial phases, respectively. In each phase, we investigate pumps in two different methods: The first one is through the action of symmetry on the boundary of the open chain (Sec.II B 2 and Sec.II C 2), and the second is via a Hamiltonian with a texture mimicking a loop for pump in the closed chain (in Sec.II B 3 and II C 3).\nA. Ground states in the Kitaev Chain\nThe Kitaev chain is a model of a 1 + 1-dimensional superconductor [10] with the Hamiltonian,\nH = L\u2211 j=1 ( \u2212\u03c9a\u2020j+1aj \u2212 \u03c9a \u2020 jaj+1 \u2212 \u00b5 ( a\u2020jaj \u2212 1 2 ) + \u2206ajaj+1 + \u2206 \u2217a\u2020ja \u2020 j+1 ) , (4)\nwhere L \u2208 Z is the system size, aj and a\u2020j are the annihilation and creation operators with the anticommutation relation\n{ai, aj} = 0, {a\u2020i , a \u2020 j} = 0, {ai, a \u2020 j} = \u03b4ij , (5)\n\u03c9 \u2208 R is the hopping amplitude of the neighboring sites, \u00b5 \u2208 R is the chemical potential, and \u2206 = ei\u03b8 |\u2206| \u2208 C is the gap function of the superconductivity. This Hamiltonian has fermion parity symmetry\n[H,P ] = 0, (6)\nwith the fermion parity operator P := (\u22121) \u2211 j a \u2020 jaj . In the periodic boundary condition, the Hamiltonian reads\nH = \u2211 k 1 2 (a\u2020k, a\u2212k)HBdG(k) ( ak a\u2020\u2212k ) , (7)\n6 with the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian\nHBdG(k) = ( \u22122\u03c9 cos(k)\u2212 \u00b5 i\u2206 sin(k) \u2212i\u2206 sin(k) 2\u03c9 cos(k) + \u00b5 ) , (8)\nwhere k is the momentum k along the chain. Diagonalizing the BdG Hamiltonian, we have the quasi-particle spectrum\n(k) = \u00b1 \u221a (2\u03c9 cos(k) + \u00b5) 2 + 4 |\u2206|2 sin2(k), (9)\nwhich is nonzero except for 2|\u03c9| = |\u00b5|. Thus, except for 2|\u03c9| = |\u00b5|, the ground state is gapped and unique, and thus an SRE state.\nThe Kitaev chain has two different phases, trivial (2|\u03c9| < |\u00b5|) and non-trivial (2|\u03c9| > |\u00b5|) phases, which are separated by the gap closing point at 2|\u03c9| = |\u00b5|. For the description of these phases, it is convenient to introduce the Majorana fermion\nc2j\u22121 = e i \u03b82 aj + e \u2212i \u03b82 a\u2020j , c2j = \u2212i ( ei \u03b8 2 aj \u2212 e\u2212i \u03b8 2 a\u2020j ) , (10)\nwith the anti-commutation relation\n{ci, cj} = 2\u03b4i,j , c\u2020j = cj . (11)\nIn the Majorana reprentation, the Hamiltonain in Eq.(4) is recast into\nH = i\n2 \u2211 j (\u2212\u00b5c2j\u22121c2j + (\u03c9 + |\u2206|) c2jc2j+1 + (\u03c9 \u2212 |\u2206|) c2j\u22121c2j+2) , (12)\nwith P = \u220f j(\u2212ic2j\u22121c2j). The analysis of the phases is particularly simple for (i) |\u2206| = \u03c9 = 0, \u00b5 < 0 (trivial phase), and (ii) |\u2206| = \u03c9 6= 0, \u00b5 = 0 (non-trivial phase), as shown below.\n(i) |\u2206| = \u03c9 = 0, \u00b5 < 0. In this case, the Hamiltonian reads\nH = \u00b5\n2 \u2211 j (\u2212ic2j\u22121c2j) . (13)\nBecause any terms in the Hamiltonian commute with each other, and the eigenvalue of \u2212ic2j\u22121c2j is \u00b11, the ground state |GS\u3009 obeys\n\u2212ic2j\u22121c2j |GS\u3009 = |GS\u3009 \u21d4 aj |GS\u3009 = 0 (14)\nfor any sites j = 1, ..., L. Thus, the ground state does not have a fermion consisting of c2j\u22121 and c2j , which we represent by the diagram \u2022\n2j\u22121 \u2212\u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 2j . In terms of the diagram, the ground state is given as\n|GS\u3009 = \u2022 1 \u2212\u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 2 \u2022 3 \u2212\u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2022 2L\u22123 \u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 2L\u22122 \u2022 2L\u22121 \u2212\u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212 \u2022 2L . (15)\nAs mentioned in the above, the ground state is unique as Eq.(14) imposes L conditions on the Hilbert space with the dimension 2L. Putting a fermion, say at site 1, we have the first excited state a\u20201 |GS\u3009, which we represent as\n\u2022 1 \u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 2 \u2022 3 \u2212\u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 4 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2022 2L\u22123 \u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 2L\u22122 \u2022 2L\u22121 \u2212\u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 2L (16)\nThe first excitation energy is \u2212\u00b5 > 0. Since the ground state has a finite energy gap independent of the size of the system, it is an SRE state.\nNote that the above analysis works both for closed and open chains. For both cases, we can impose the same condition in Eq.(14) on any site of the chain. In particular, no gapless boundary state appears in the trivial phase.\n7 (ii) |\u2206| = \u03c9 > 0, \u00b5 = 0.\nIn this case, the Hamiltonian in the periodic boundary condition reads\nH = \u2212\u03c9 \u2211 j (\u2212ic2jc2j+1) , (17)\nwith c2L+1 = c1. Introducing a virtual complex fermion a\u0303j as\na\u0303j = 1\n2 (c2j + ic2j+1) , (18)\nwe have\nH = 2\u03c9 L\u2211 j=1 ( a\u0303\u2020j a\u0303j \u2212 1 2 ) , (19)\nand thus the ground state satisfies\na\u0303j |GS\u3009 = 0, (20)\nfor any j = 1, ..., L. From Eq.(20), the ground state does not have a fermion consisting of c2j and c2j+1, so we can represented it by the following diagram.\n|GS\u3009 = \u2022 1 \u2022 2 \u2212\u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 3 \u2022 4 \u2212\u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 5 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2022 2L\u22124 \u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 2L\u22123 \u2022 2L\u22122 \u2212\u2212>\u2212\u2212\u2022 2L\u22121 \u2022 2L\n| |< (21)\nThe ground state is unique and has a finite gap 2\u03c9, and thus an SRE state again.\nIn contrast to the case (i), the present case shows zero energy boundary modes in the open chain: In the open boundary condition, no bond between site L and site 1 exists, and thus the summation in Eq.(17) excludes j = L. As a result, the ground state does not satisfy Eq.(20) at j = L. Therefore, in addition to the original ground state obeying a\u0303L|GS\u3009 = 0, a\u0303\u2020L |GS\u3009 also gives the ground state. Thus, the ground state in the open boundary condition has 2-fold degeneracy. Physically, the 2-fold degeneracy originates from the Majorana fermions c1 and c2L at the boundary of the system. Since they do not participate in the Hamiltonian in Eq.(17), they becomes gapless.\nNote that fermion parity distinguishes the degenerate ground states: a\u0303L |GS\u3009 has an odd fermion parity relative to |GS\u3009. The doubly degenerate ground states due to Majorana boundary modes is a hallmark of the non-trivial phase in the Kitaev chain, which remain in the entire parameter region with 2|\u03c9| > |\u00b5|.\nB. Adiabatic pump in the non-trivial phase\nTo investigate the fermion parity pump in fermionic SRE states, we consider a one-parameter family of unique gapped Hamiltonians {H(\u03b8)}\u03b8\u2208[0,2\u03c0] with\nH(0) = H(2\u03c0). (22)\nBelow, we employ two different methods in the analysis of such a family of Hamiltonians. The first one is through the action of fermion parity symmetry on the boundary, and the second one is via a Hamiltonian of a closed system with spatially modulated \u03b8 mimicking a loop of a pump.\nIn this section, we examine the fermion parity pump in the Kitaev chain in the non-trivial phase. We introduce a phase of the gap function as the parameter of a pump (Sec.II B 1), and perform both the boundary (Sec.II B 2) and texture (Sec.II B 3) analyses for the fermion parity pump.\n8 1. Model\nAs explained in the previous section, in the non-trivial phase, the open chain hosts doubly degenerate ground states with opposite fermion parity, caused by Majorana boundary modes. For a finite chain, the degeneracy is slightly lifted, and the true ground state has either an even or odd fermion parity. As shown by Kitaev, the 2\u03c0 phase rotation of the gap function flips the fermion parity of the ground state [10]. Inspired by this observation, we regard the Hamiltonian in Eq.(4) with |\u2206| = \u03c9 = 1 and \u00b5 = 0 as a one-parameter family of Hamiltonians in the non-trivial phase,\nH(\u03b8) = \u2212 L\u2211 j=1 (a\u2020j+1aj + e i\u03b8aj+1aj + h.c.), (23)\nwith fermion parity symmetry P = \u220fL j=1(\u22121)\na\u2020jaj . As already shown in Sec.II A, the Hamiltonian and the fermion parity operator read\nH(\u03b8) = \u2212 L\u2211 j=1 (\u2212ic \u03b8 2 2jc \u03b8 2 2j+1), P = L\u220f j=1 (\u2212ic \u03b8 2 2j\u22121c \u03b8 2 2j) (24)\nin terms of the Majorana fermion in Eq.(10), where we make explicit the \u03b8-dependence of the Majorana fermion. Note that the Majorana fermion c \u03b8 2 j is 4\u03c0-periodic in \u03b8, while the Hamiltonian is 2\u03c0-periodic.\n2. Open chain\nIn the open chain, c \u03b8 2 2L+1 identically vanishes, and thus the ground state condition \u2212ic \u03b8 2 2jc \u03b8 2 2j+1 = 1 excludes\nj = L. The Majorana fermions c \u03b8 2 1 and c \u03b8 2\n2L do not participate in the Hamiltonian, so they are gapless in the whole region of \u03b8.\nWe investigate here the action of fermion parity symmetry on the boundary Majorana fermions and extract a topological invariant of the adiabatic process given by \u03b8. On the ground state, the fermion parity P is written as\nP |G.S. = \u2212ic \u03b8 2 1 c \u03b8 2 2L, (25)\nfrom the ground state condition \u2212ic \u03b8 2 2jc \u03b8 2 2j+1 = 1 (j = 1, . . . , L\u22121). Therefore, the fermion parity is \u201cfractionalized\u201d on the ground state: it splits into two well-separated Majorana fermions c \u03b8 2 1 and c \u03b8 2\n2L. Note that the fractionalized fermion parity is not compatible with the 2\u03c0-periodicity in \u03b8. For instance, let us consider the left contribution \u03b3L\u03b8 = c \u03b8 2 1 of P |G.S.. Using the U(1) phase ambiguity in the definition of \u03b3L\u03b8 , we can recover the 2\u03c0 periodicity by multiplying a suitable U(1) phase like \u03b3L\u03b8 = e i\u03b8 2 c \u03b8 2 1 . However, the choice \u03b3 L \u03b8 = e i\u03b8 2 c \u03b8 2 1 does not provide a proper definition of the Majorana fermion since it obeys (\u03b3L\u03b8 ) 2 = ei\u03b8 6= 1.\nThe incompatibility observed in the above is general and originates from a topological obstruction. Since Majorana boundary modes are only excitations between the (nearly) degenerate ground states of the nontrivial phase, the fermion parity always shows the fractionalization in the above. The left contribution \u03b3L\u03b8 consists of the Majorana mode on the left boundary, and can be chosen to be 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03b8, \u03b3L\u03b8+2\u03c0 = \u03b3 L \u03b8 , by using the U(1) phase ambiguity. However, the square of the 2\u03c0-periodic \u03b3L\u03b8 gives a non-zero U(1) phase (\u03b3L\u03b8 ) 2 = ei\u03a6\u03b8 \u2208 U(1) in general, from which we can define the Z/2Z invariant\n\u03bd = 1\n2\u03c0i\n\u222e d\u03a6\u03b8. (26)\nAlthough the above integral takes an integer, \u03bd defines a Z/2Z number because the 2\u03c0-periodic \u03b3L\u03b8 has the ambiguity \u03b3L\u03b8 7\u2192 ei\u03b1\u03b8\u03b3L\u03b8 with a smooth 2\u03c0-periodic function ei\u03b1\u03b8 , and ei\u03b1\u03b8 changes \u03bd by an even integer. Then, an odd \u03bd obstructs the 2\u03c0-periodic \u03b3L\u03b8 to obey the proper parity relation (\u03b3 L \u03b8 )\n2 = 1 at the same time. In the above case, we have \u03bd = 1, and thus the incompatibility remains for any deformation keeping the gap.\n9 3. Textured Hamiltonian\nIn the previous subsection, we investigate a family of Hamiltonians H(\u03b8) (\u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]) in the open chain. Here we examine the closed chain using a textured Hamiltonian similar to H(\u03b8). The textured Hamiltonian is a Hamiltonian with a spatially modulated parameter: Let hj(\u03b8) be the local term at site j in Eq.(4) with \u2206 = |\u2206|ei\u03b8 (i.e. H(\u03b8) = \u2211 j hj(\u03b8)), then we define the textured Hamiltonian H l text as follows,\nH ltext = l\u2211 j=1 hj(\u03b8 = 2\u03c0j l ) + L\u2211 j=l+1 hj(\u03b8 = 2\u03c0 = 0). (27)\nwhere l is the size of the texture. In the nontrivial phase, the spatial texture in the gap function results in a fermion parity pump in the spatial direction, and thus the ground state of H ltext is expected to host an odd fermion parity relative to that of an untextured Hamiltonian.\nFigure 2 shows our numerical result for the fermion parity of the ground state. This result confirms that the texture in the gap function actually induces a flip of the fermion parity in the non-trivial phase.\nWe can also analytically demonstrate the flip of the fermion parity. For simplicity, we consider hj(\u03b8) with |\u2206| = \u03c9 = 1, \u00b5 = 0, and L = l. When the system size L is sufficiently large, the resultant textured Hamiltonian is almost approximated by the unitary transformation\nUtext = \u220f j ei \u03b8j 2 nj , (\u03b8j = 2\u03c0j/L, nj = a \u2020 jaj), (28)\non the Hamiltonian\nH = \u2212 L\u2211 j=1 (a\u2020j+1aj + a \u2020 j+1aj + a \u2020 ja \u2020 j+1 + aj+1aj). (29)\nActually, we have\nUtextHU \u2020 text = \u2212 L\u2211 j=1 (ei \u03b8j+1\u2212\u03b8j 2 a\u2020j+1aj + e i \u03b8j+1+\u03b8j 2 a\u2020ja \u2020 j+1 + h.c.) (30)\n= \u2212 L\u22121\u2211 j=1 (ei \u03c0 L a\u2020j+1aj + e i 2\u03c0jL +i \u03c0 L a\u2020ja \u2020 j+1 + h.c.)\u2212 (e i \u03c0L\u2212i\u03c0a\u20201e 2\u03c0L L +i\u03c0aL + a \u2020 La \u2020 1 + h.c.), (31)\n10\nwhich is almost the textured Hamiltonian if we ignore terms O( \u03c0L ) 1. However, because of the unnecessary factor e\u2212i\u03c0 between sites L and 1 in the second term of Eq.(31), this Hamiltonian does not satisfy the periodic boundary condition even for L 1. To avoid this problem, we modify the unitary transformation Utext as\nU\u0303text = c2LUtext, (32)\nwhere c2L is the Majorana fermion at site L, then H\u0303text := U\u0303textHU\u0303 \u2020 text approximates the textured Hamiltonian:\nH l=Ltext = H\u0303text +O( \u03c0\nL ). (33)\nThe ground state of Htext is given by |GS\u2032\u3009 = U\u0303text |GS\u3009 with |GS\u3009 the ground state of the untextured Hamiltonian in Eq.(29). Since U\u0303text anti-commutes with the fermion parity P = (\u22121) \u2211 j nj , the ratio\n\u3008GS\u2032|P |GS\u2032\u3009 \u3008GS|P |GS\u3009\n(34)\nis equal to \u22121.\nC. Adiabatic pump in the trivial phase\nIn this section, we consider the fermion parity pump in the trivial phase (Sec.II B 1). We perform both the boundary (Sec.II B 2) and texture (Sec.II B 3) analyses.\n1. Model\nFirst, we give a solvable model of a pump in the trivial phase, which is constructed from the pump Hamiltonian in Eq.(24) in the non-trivial phase. For this purpose, it is useful to rewrite the local term in (24) in the form of the unitary transformation\n\u2212ic \u03b8 2 2jc \u03b8 2 2j+1 = U \u2032 \u03b8(\u2212ic2jc2j+1)[U \u2032\u03b8]\u22121, (35)\nwhere cj is the Majorana fermion in Eq.(10) with \u03b8 = 0, and\nU \u2032\u03b8 = \u220f j\u2208Z e\u2212 i\u03b8 2 a \u2020 jaj = \u220f j\u2208Z e\u2212 i\u03b8 2 1+ic2j\u22121c2j 2 (36)\nis the (\u03b8/2)-phase rotation of the complex fermion aj . Noting that Eq.(13) of the trivial phase is related to Eq.(17) of the non-trivial phase by the transformation cj \u2192 cj\u22121, we consider the local term\nBj(\u03b8) := U\u03b8(\u2212ic2j\u22121c2j)U\u22121\u03b8 (37)\nwith\nU\u03b8 = \u220f j\u2208Z e\u2212 i\u03b8 2 1+ic2jc2j+1 2 . (38)\nIn terms of the original complex fermion, Bj(\u03b8) is given as\nBj(\u03b8) = 1 + cos \u03b8 2 (1\u2212 2a\u2020jaj)\u2212 1\u2212 cos \u03b8 2 (aj\u22121 + a \u2020 j\u22121)(aj+1 \u2212 a \u2020 j+1) + i sin \u03b8(ajaj+1 + a \u2020 ja \u2020 j+1). (39)\nThe resultant Hamiltonian H(\u03b8) = \u2212 \u2211 j Bj(\u03b8) has the 2\u03c0-periodicity in \u03b8, and is unitary equivalent to Eq.(13) with \u00b5 = \u22121. Therefore, it defines a pump in the trivial phase. Note that H(\u03b8) is solvable since Bj(\u03b8)s commute with each other and have eigenvalues \u00b11.\n11\n2. Open chain\nSimilar to the analysis in Sec. II B 2, we investigate the fermion pump in an open chain of the solvable model through fermion parity on the boundaries. For the open chain with L sites, we consider the Hamiltonian,\nH(\u03b8) = Hbulk(\u03b8) +Hbdy(\u03b8), (40)\nwhere Hbulk(\u03b8) is the bulk Hamiltonian\nHbulk(\u03b8) = \u2212 L\u22121\u2211 j=2 B\u03b8j = \u2212 L\u22121\u2211 j=2 U\u03b8(\u2212ic2j\u22121c2j)U\u22121\u03b8 , (41)\nwith U\u03b8 in the open chain\nUopen\u03b8 = L\u22121\u220f j=1 e\u2212 i\u03b8 2 1+ic2jc2j+1 2 = L\u22121\u220f j=1 e\u2212i \u03b8 4 [cos (\u03b8/4) + c2jc2j+1 sin (\u03b8/4)] . (42)\nOn the boundaries, we consider a local Hamiltonian Hbdy(\u03b8) instead of B \u03b8 j=1,L, which are defined by B \u03b8 j=1 = Uopen\u03b8 ( i 2c1c2)[U open \u03b8 ] \u22121 and B\u03b8j=L = U open \u03b8 ( i 2c2L\u22121c2L)[U open \u03b8 ] \u22121, respectively, because the latter terms are not 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03b8. We assume that Hbdy(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03b8 and small compared to the bulk gap.\nThe system supports four-fold ground state degeneracy: Since Hbulk(\u03b8 = 0) = 2 \u2211L\u22121 j=2 (a \u2020 jaj \u2212 1/2), the\nground states of Hbulk(\u03b8 = 0) are annihilated by aj with j = 2, . . . , L\u2212 1, which consist of the four states\n|\u03a810\u3009 = |vac\u3009 , |\u03a820\u3009 = a \u2020 1 |vac\u3009 , |\u03a830\u3009 = a \u2020 L |vac\u3009 , |\u03a8 4 0\u3009 = a \u2020 1a \u2020 L |vac\u3009 , (43)\nwith the Fock vacuum |vac\u3009. Thus, from Hbulk(\u03b8) = U\u03b8Hbulk(\u03b8 = 0)U\u22121\u03b8 , we have four-fold degenerate ground states of Hbulk(\u03b8) |\u03a8i\u03b8\u3009 = U\u03b8 |\u03a8i0\u3009 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). Note that even in the presence of Hbdy(\u03b8), the ground states are nearly degenerate as long as Hbdy(\u03b8) is small enough.\nTo study the fermion parity pump, we rewrite the four states in Eq.(43) as\n|\u03a810\u3009 = 1\n2L \u2211 \u03c31,...,\u03c3L |\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009, |\u03a820\u3009 = 1 2L \u2211 \u03c31,...,\u03c3L \u03c31|\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009,\n|\u03a830\u3009 = 1\n2L \u2211 \u03c31,...,\u03c3L \u03c3L|\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009, |\u03a840\u3009 = 1 2L \u2211 \u03c31,...,\u03c3L \u03c31\u03c3L|\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009, (44)\nwith\n|\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009 = (1 + \u03c31a\u20201)(1 + \u03c32a \u2020 2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (1 + \u03c3La \u2020 L)|vac\u3009, (45)\nwhere the summation in Eq.(44) runs over all possible \u03c3j = \u00b11. Then, using the relation\nc2jc2j+1|\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009 = \u2212i(aj \u2212 a\u2020j)(aj+1 + a \u2020 j+1)|\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009\n= i\u03c3j\u03c3j+1|\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009, (46)\nwe obtain\n|\u03a81\u03b8\u3009 = 1\n2L \u2211 \u03c31,...,\u03c3L e\u2212 i\u03b8 2 Ndw |\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009 , |\u03a82\u03b8\u3009 = 1 2L \u2211 \u03c31,...,\u03c3L e\u2212 i\u03b8 2 Ndw\u03c31 |\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009 ,\n|\u03a83\u03b8\u3009 = 1\n2L \u2211 \u03c31,...,\u03c3L e\u2212 i\u03b8 2 Ndw\u03c3L |\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009 , |\u03a84\u03b8\u3009 = 1 2L \u2211 \u03c31,...,\u03c3L e\u2212 i\u03b8 2 Ndw\u03c31\u03c3L |\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u3009 . (47)\n12\nHere Ndw = \u2211L\u22121 j=1 1\u2212\u03c3j\u03c3j+1 2 counts domain walls in the array \u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L where adjacent \u03c3j and \u03c3j+1 have an opposite sign. The above ground states |\u03a8i\u03b8\u3009 exhibit a fermion (or anti-fermion) pump. For instance, let us consider |\u03a81\u03b8\u3009, which is the Fock vacuum |vac\u3009 at \u03b8 = 0. Because Ndw is even (odd) when \u03c31 = \u03c3L (\u03c31 = \u2212\u03c3L), we have\n|\u03a81\u03b8=2\u03c0\u3009 = 1\n2L \u2211 \u03c31,...,\u03c3L\u22121 |\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u22121, \u03c31\u3009 \u2212 1 2L \u2211 \u03c31,...,\u03c3L\u22121 |\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3L\u22121,\u2212\u03c31\u3009\n= a\u20201a \u2020 L|vac\u3009(= |\u03a8 4 0\u3009). (48)\nThus, the one-cycle evolution pumps boundary fermions a\u20201 and a \u2020 L on |\u03a810\u3009. As a result, |\u03a810\u3009 goes to |\u03a840\u3009 and vice versa. In a similar manner, we can show that |\u03a820\u3009 and |\u03a830\u3009 are interchanged after the one-cycle evolution. Note that the pumped fermions vanish after the next one-cycle evolution, which suggests that a Z/2Z number characterizes the pump. Actually, we can construct the Z/2Z number from the fermion parity operator.\nTo construct the Z/2Z number, we take the basis in which the ground states of Hbulk(\u03b8) are 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03b8: Taking linear combinations of \u03a8i\u03b8, we have\n|\u03a8\u03b8(\u03c31, \u03c3L)\u3009 = \u2211\n\u03c32,...,\u03c3L\u22121\ne\u2212 i\u03b8 2 (Ndw+1\u2212 \u03c31+\u03c3L 2 ) |\u03c31, \u03c32, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c3L\u22121, \u03c3L\u3009 , (49)\nwhere \u03c31 = \u00b11 and \u03c3L = \u00b11 are now the indices specifying the four-fold degenerate ground states. The ground states in the new basis are 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03b8 since Ndw is even (odd) when \u03c31 = \u03c3L (\u03c31 = \u2212\u03c3L).\nThe fermion parity operator P = (\u22121) \u2211 j a \u2020 jaj acts on the ground states as\nP |\u03a8\u03b8(\u03c31, \u03c3L)\u3009 = ei\u03b8 \u03c31+\u03c3L 2 |\u03a8\u03b8(\u2212\u03c31,\u2212\u03c3L)\u3009 . = \u2211 \u03c3\u20321,\u03c3 \u2032 L [e i\u03b8 2 \u03c3\u0304 z 1 \u03c3\u0304x1 ]\u03c31\u03c3\u20321 [e i\u03b8 2 \u03c3\u0304 z L \u03c3\u0304xL]\u03c3L\u03c3\u2032L |\u03a8\u03b8(\u03c3 \u2032 1, \u03c3 \u2032 L)\u3009 , (50)\nwhere \u03c3\u0304\u00b5i are the Pauli matrices acting on the index \u03c3i (i = 1, L). Therefore, we have the matrix representation of the fermion parity in a fractionalized form\nP |G.S. = p\u03b81p\u03b8L (51)\nwith\np\u03b8j = e i\u03b8 2 \u03c3\u0304 z j \u03c3\u0304xj , j = 1, L. (52)\nThe fractionalized parity operator obeys (p\u03b8j ) 2 = 1 like an ordinary parity operator, but it is not 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03b8, i.e. p\u03b8+2\u03c0j = \u2212p\u03b8j . We note that p\u03b81 has a U(1) phase ambiguity: a simultaneous redefinition p\u03b81 7\u2192 ei\u03b1p\u03b81 and p\u03b8L 7\u2192 e\u2212i\u03b1p\u03b8L does not change the equality (51). Whereas the 2\u03c0-periodicity of p\u03b8j can be recovered by using the phase ambiguity, it is not compatible with (p\u03b8j ) 2 = 1: Once we choose the U(1) phase of p\u03b81 such that p\u03b81 is 2\u03c0-periodic in \u03b8, we have a non-trivial U(1) phase in (p \u03b8 1) 2, (p\u03b81) 2 = ei\u03a6\u03b8 , and thus p\u03b81 is now a projective representation of the parity. As discussed in Sec.II B 2, the incompatibility originates from a topological obstruction: In a manner similar to Sec.II B 2, the phase \u03a6\u03b8 defines the topological number \u03bd in Eq. (26). Note that only the Z/2Z part of \u03bd is relevant, since the 2\u03c0-periodic p\u03b81 still has a phase ambiguity p \u03b8 1 7\u2192 ei\u03b1\u03b8p\u03b81 with a periodic function ei\u03b1\u03b8 , which changes \u03bd by an even integer. In the present case, we obtain the 2\u03c0-periodic p\u03b81 by multiplying p \u03b8 j in Eq. (52) by e i\u03b8 2 . Thus, we have ei\u03a6\u03b8 = ei\u03b8 and \u03bd = 1, which means that \u03a6\u03b8 cannot be identically zero.\n3. Stacked Kitaev chain with texture\nIn a manner similar to Sec.II B 3, we can investigate the fermion parity pump in the closed chain of the solvable model in the above by introducing a texture in the Hamiltonian. We expect that the fermion parity\n13\nof the ground state changes by \u22121 by introducing the texture, but instead of repeating the straightforward analysis, we here consider another model of the closed chain in the trivial phase.\nA stack of two Kitaev chains is topologically trivial since the Kitaev chain belongs to a Z/2Z phase. In this section, we consider a pump in the following 4\u00d7 4 Hamiltonian describing the stack of Kitaev chains,\nH = 1\n2 \u2211 k,\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 (a\u2020k,\u03c3, a\u2212k,\u03c3)HBdG(k)\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 ( ak,\u03c3\u2032 a\u2020\u2212k,\u03c3\u2032 ) , (53)\nHBdG(k) = sin(k)\u03c41 \u2297 \u03c30 + (m+ cos(k))\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c33, (54) where \u03c4i are Pauli matrices in the Nambu space, \u03c3i are Pauli matrices labeling the two Kitaev chains, and m is a real parameter. This model has particle-hole symmetry [H,\u039e] = 0 with \u039e = K\u03c41 \u2297 \u03c30 and K the complex conjugate operator.\nTo investigate the fermion parity pump of this model, we add a term with a spatial texture. The additional texture term should keep particle-hole symmetry and commute with the first term of the above Hamiltonian to maintain a gap of the system. Based on this argument, we consider the following one-parameter family of Hamiltonians\nHBdG(k, \u03b8) = sin(k)\u03c41 \u2297 \u03c30 + sin(\u03b8)\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c31 + (m+ cos(\u03b8) + cos(k))\u03c43 \u2297 \u03c33. (55) Performing the Fourier transformation,\nak,\u03c3 = \u2211 n e\u2212inkan,\u03c3, a \u2020 k,\u03c3 = \u2211 n einka\u2020n,\u03c3, (56)\nwe have the Hamiltonian in the real space H(\u03b8) = \u2211 j,\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 [ 1 2 a\u2020j,\u03c3(\u03c33)\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032aj\u22121,\u03c3\u2032 + 1 2 a\u2020j\u22121,\u03c3(\u03c33)\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032aj,\u03c3\u2032 + sin(\u03b8)a \u2020 j,\u03c3(\u03c31)\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032aj,\u03c3\u2032\n+(m+ cos(\u03b8))a\u2020j,\u03c3(\u03c33)\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032aj,\u03c3\u2032 ]\n+ \u2211 j,\u03c3 [ + 1 2i a\u2020j,\u03c3a \u2020 j\u22121,\u03c3 \u2212 1 2i a\u2020j\u22121,\u03c3a \u2020 j,\u03c3 + 1 2i aj,\u03c3aj\u22121,\u03c3 \u2212 1 2i aj\u22121,\u03c3aj,\u03c3 ] . (57)\nWhen \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, the system reduces to two decoupled Kitaev chains. The decoupled Kitaev chains belong to the same phase, but the common phase can be different between \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0. Actually, this happens for |m| < 2, which suggests that H(\u03b8) with |m| < 2 gives a non-trivial loop.\nSimilar to Sec.II B 3, we numerically examine the fermion parity pump of the stacked Kitaev chain under the periodic boundary condition by introducing the textured Hamiltonian H l=Ltext = \u2211 j hj(\u03b8 = 2\u03c0j L ), where\nhj(\u03b8) is the local term of H(\u03b8) in Eq.(57), i.e. H(\u03b8) = \u2211 j hj(\u03b8). Figure 3 shows the numerical result for the ratio of the fermion parity of the ground state for H l=Ltext and that for H(\u03b8 = 0). This result suggests the presence of the fermion parity pump for |m| < 2.\n14\nIII. MATRIX PRODUCT STATE\nSo far, we have considered pumps in a particular model, i.e. the free Kitaev chain. Now we develop a theory of pumps in 1+1-dimensional translation invariant SRE states including interactions, based on matrix product states (MPSs) representations [24] 4. MPSs provide a systematic way to describe 1 + 1-dimensional manybody quantum states by using a set of matrices. MPSs can approximate any non-degenerate gapped ground states with arbitrary precision by increasing the bond dimension as a polynomial function of system size [26]. For bosonic states, a class of MPSs called injective MPSs played an important role in studying topological natures of the non-degenerate gapped ground states. An injective MPS is a translation invariant MPS with a fixed finite bond dimension, irrespective of system size, and has algebraic properties described below. Injective MPSs can describe any non-degenerate gapped ground states of short-ranged Hamiltonians [24]. In this section, we introduce fermionic injective MPSs (fMPSs), Z2-graded generalization of injective MPSs, along the lines of Ref.12.\nIn contrast to general MPSs, injective MPSs have a limitation to describe non-degenerate gapped ground states: Whereas a generic non-degenerate gapped ground state may allow power-law corrections in exponentially decaying correlation functions [27], MPSs with a fixed bond dimension do not have such corrections. We leave the topological classification of pumps for general fermionic SRE states in future work.\nBelow we assume the translational invariance of states |\u03c8\u3009: i.e., T |\u03c8\u3009 = |\u03c8\u3009 with T the translation operator by a lattice constant.\nA. Bosonic MPS\n1. Injective MPS\nConsider a 1-dimensional lattice with L sites with local Hilbert space spanned by the orthonormal basis {|ik\u3009}Nik=1 at site k. The lattice-translation operator T is defined by T |i1i2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iL\u3009 = |iLi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iL\u22121\u3009. We call states invariant under the lattice translation T |\u03c8\u3009 = |\u03c8\u3009 as translation invariant states. For the wave function \u03c8(i1, . . . , iL) defined by |\u03c8\u3009 = \u2211N i1,...,iL=1 \u03c8(i1, . . . , iL) |i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iL\u3009, the state |\u03c8\u3009 is translation invariant if\n\u03c8(i1, i2, . . . , iL) = \u03c8(i2, . . . , iL, i1) (58)\nholds for any i1, . . . , iL. It is known that any translation invariant state |\u03c8\u3009 is represented in the form of a translation invariant MPS [24]\n|\u03c8\u3009 = |{Ai}i\u3009L := N\u2211\ni1,...,iL=1\ntr[Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL ] |i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iL\u3009 , (59)\nwhere Ais are n \u00d7 n matrices. (n is called the bond dimension.) For Ai\u03b1\u03b2 , we call i the physical leg and \u03b1 and \u03b2 the virtual legs.\nApparently,the MPS representation of |\u03c8\u3009 is not unique. For example, two MPSs related by Ai = ei\u03b2X\u22121BiX with ei\u03b2 a U(1) phase and X an invertible matrix give the same physical state with the same norm for any system size L \u2208 N.\n4 Most of these properties are stated in Ref.25, but in a mathematical style.\n15\nDefinition 1 (Gauge equivalence condition of MPS). We call two MPS representations by {Ai}i and {Bi}i are gauge equivalent {Ai}i \u223c {Bi}i if there exists a U(1) phase ei\u03b1L for any L \u2208 N such that\n|{Ai}i\u3009L = e i\u03b1L |{Bi}i\u3009L . (60)\nThe condition in Eq.(60) is equivalent to\ntr[Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL ] = ei\u03b1Ltr[Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL ] (61)\nfor any L \u2208 N and i1, . . . , iL.\nTo rephrase the gauge equivalence condition in terms of the set of matrices {Ai}i, we introduce injective MPSs [24] described below. A set of matrices {Ai}i is said to be irreducible if any Ai does not have a proper left invariant subspace, i.e., there is no projector P such that AiP = PAiP for any i [24]. The irreducible condition is equivalent to that the algebra generated by {Ai}i, which is spanned by all possible products of matrices Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Aik with all k \u2208 N, coincides with the set of n \u00d7 n matrices Mn(C), or in other words, the algebra generated by Ais is central simple. (See Appendix A for the definition of central simple.) Then, a set of matrices {Ai}i is said to be injective if all possible products of matrices Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail with a fixed l spans Mn(C) [24]. Obviously, if {Ai}i is injective, {Ai}i is irreducible.5 The injective condition is equivalently expressed as the following conditions for the transfer matrix EA : Mn(C) \u2192 Mn(C) defined by EA(X) := \u2211N i=1A\niXAi\u2020 [28]: Let \u03c1A be the the maximum of the absolute values of eigenvalues of the transfer matrix EA. A set of matrices {Ai}i is injective if and only if (i) EA has a unique eigenvalue, \u03bb, with |\u03bb| = \u03c1A, and (ii) the corresponding eigenvector is a positive definite matrix. An injective MPS does not give a superposition of macroscopically different states, and shows exponentially decaying correlation functions. It is known that if {Ai}i is injective, the smallest integer lmin for which the set of products {Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail} spans Mn(C) is bounded from above as lmin < (n2 \u2212N + 1)n2 [28].\n2. Fundamental theorem of injective MPS\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for two injective MPSs to give the same physical state are known as the fundamental theorem of MPS [29]. Before stating the theorem, it is useful to introduce the canonical form of MPS [24]. When the set of matrices {Ai}i is irreducible, one can normalize Ai so that \u2211 iA\niAi\u2020 = 1n while keeping the physical state unchanged 6. The set of irreducible MPS with \u2211 iA\niAi\u2020 = 1n is said to be in the canonical form. Note that the spectral radius of EA is 1 when we take the canonical from. We start with Theorem 7 in Ref. 24 7.\n5 The converse is not true. For example, if we take A\u2191 =\n( 1\n0\n) and A\u2193 = ( 0\n1\n) , the algebra generated by them is isomorphic\nto M2(C), and thus they are irreducible. However, they are not injective because products of odd (even) numbers of them only span C (\n1 0\n) \u2295 C ( 0\n1\n) ( C ( 1\n0\n) \u2295 C ( 0\n1\n) ).\n6 Let Y be the eigenvector of the transfer matrix EA with the eigenvalue \u03bb = \u03c1A. The eigenvector Y is positive definite. Then, A\u0303i = \u03c1\n\u22121/2 A Y \u22121/2AiY 1/2 gives the canonical form. 7 Theorem 7 in Ref. 24 states the equivalence condition for two MPSs {Ai}i and {A\u0303i}i as |{A\u0303i}i\u3009L = |{Ai}i\u3009L. Namely, the\nequivalence as a vector in the Hilbert space. In Theorem 2 of this paper, the equivalence condition is set as the same physical state with the same norm.\n16\nTheorem 1 ([24, 30]). Let a set of n\u00d7n matrices {Ai}i be injective and in the canonical form, and let another set of n\u00d7 n matrices {A\u0303i}i be irreducible and in the canonical form. Then, the following two statements are equivalent.\n(i) Two sets {Ai}i and {A\u0303i}i represent the same physical state for some length L > 2l + n4 in the sense that |{A\u0303i}i\u3009L = ei\u03b1 |{Ai}i\u3009L holds with a U(1) phase ei\u03b1.\n(ii) There exist a unitary matrix V \u2208 U(n) and a U(1) phase ei\u03b2 \u2208 U(1) satisfying\nA\u0303i = ei\u03b2V \u2020AiV. (62)\nHere l is a positive integer for which the set of products {Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail} spans Mn(C), V is unique up to a U(1) phase, and ei\u03b2 is unique.\nSee [24] for the existence of such V and ei\u03b2 . The uniqueness of V and ei\u03b2 follows from the property that 1n is the nondegenerate eigenvalue of the transfer matrix EA, and there is no eigenvalues of magnitude 1 [30]. As a corollary, we have the following, which we refer to the fundamental theorem for bosonic MPS in this paper.\nTheorem 2 (Fundamental theorem for bosonic MPS [24, 30]). Let {Ai}i and {Bi}i be injective MPSs in the canonical form. They are gauge equivalent {Ai}i \u223c {Bi}i if and only if there exist a unitary matrix V \u2208 U(n) and a U(1) phase ei\u03b2 \u2208 U(1) satisfying\nA\u0303i = ei\u03b2V \u2020AiV. (63)\nV is unique up to a U(1) phase, and ei\u03b2 is unique.\nThis theorem means that a family of injective MPSs for the same physical state over a parameter space X is a U(1)\u00d7 PU(n) bundle over X, where n is the bond dimension and PU(n) = U(n)/U(1) is the projective unitary group of U(n) [31]. For adiabatic pumps, where X = S1, U(1) \u00d7 PU(n) bundle over S1 is always trivial, and thus no nontrivial adiabatic pumps exist. However, in the presence of onsite symmetry, nontrivial adiabatic pumps are possible, as described in Sec. III A 3.\nIn the rest of this section, we give examples of an injective MPS and a non-injective one, respectively. Example 1 : The Cluster Model (as an injective case)\u2014 Consider the Hamiltonian of the cluster model on\na periodic chain:\nHcluster = L\u2211 j=1 \u03c3zj\u03c3 x j+1\u03c3 z j+2. (64)\nThis model has a Z/2Z\u00d7 Z/2Z symmetry generated by Ue = \u220f j \u03c3 x 2j and Uo = \u220f j \u03c3 x 2j+1. The ground state of this model is unique and gapped, which is given by\n|GS\u3009 = \u2211\n\u03c31,...,\u03c3L { L\u220f j=1 s(\u03c3j , \u03c3j+1)} |\u03c31, ..., \u03c3L\u3009 (65)\n= \u2211\n\u03c31,...,\u03c3L\n(\u22121)NDW(\u03c31,...,\u03c3L) |\u03c31, ..., \u03c3L\u3009 (66)\nwhere \u03c3j =\u2191, \u2193 and s(\u03c3, \u03c3\u2032) is given by\ns(\u03c3, \u03c3\u2032) = { \u22121 (\u03c3, \u03c3\u2032) = (\u2191, \u2193), (\u2193, \u2191) 1 (\u03c3, \u03c3\u2032) = (\u2191, \u2191), (\u2193, \u2193)\n(67)\nand NDW(\u03c31, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c3L) is the number of j with | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c3j , \u03c3j+1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009 = | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u2193, \u2191, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009 or | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u2191, \u2193, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009. An MPS of this model is given by\nA\u2191 = ( 1 1 0 0 ) , A\u2193 = ( 0 0 \u22121 1 ) . (68)\n17\nThe set of matrices {AiAj}i,j\u2208{\u2191,\u2193} spans M2(C), and thus the MPS is injective. Example 2 : The Ising model (as a non-injective case)\u2014 Consider the Hamiltonian of the Ising model:\nHIsing = \u2212 \u2211 j\u2208Z \u03c3zj\u03c3 z j+1. (69)\nAn MPS of this model is given by\nA\u2191 = ( 1 0 0 0 ) , A\u2193 = ( 0 0 0 1 ) . (70)\nThe algebra generated by A\u2191 and A\u2193 is not M2(C).\n3. Adiabatic cycle of injective MPS with onsite symmetry\nSuppose that the total Hilbert space is equipped with a group action of a symmetry group G such that it acts on the local Hilbert space as\nU\u0302g |j\u3009 = |i\u3009 \u2211 j [ug]ij , g \u2208 G, (71)\nwhere ug are U(n) matrices. Some elements of G can be antiunitary and are specified by a homomorphism s : G\u2192 {\u00b11} so that U\u0302giU\u0302\u22121g = sgi. We also require U\u0302g to be a linear representation, namely, ugu sg h = ugh holds. Here we have introduced the notation\nXsg = { X sg = 1, X\u2217 sg = \u22121,\n(72)\nfor matrices X. Now suppose that an injective MPS {Ai}i in the canonical form preserves the G symmetry in the sense that for any system size L \u2208 N there exists ei\u03b1L \u2208 U(1) such that\nU\u0302g |{Ai}\u3009L = e i\u03b1L |{Ai}\u3009L . (73)\nThis is equivalent to say { \u2211 j [ug]ij(A\nj)sg}i \u223c {Ai}i for any g \u2208 G as a bosonic MPS. From the fundamental theorem for bosonic MPS, there exists a unique U(1) phase ei\u03b2g and a U(n) matrix Vg such that\u2211\nj\n[ug]ij(A j)sg = ei\u03b2gV \u2020g A iVg (74)\nfor g \u2208 G, where Vg is unique up to U(1) phases. The linearity of ug and the uniqueness of ei\u03b2g and Vg implies that ei\u03b2geisg\u03b2h = ei\u03b2gh and there exists zg,h \u2208 U(1) such that\nVgV sg h = zg,hVgh (75)\nfor g, h \u2208 G. The equality Vg(VhV shk )sg = (VgV sg h )V sgh k implies that zg,h is a two cocycle z \u2208 Z2(G,U(1)s) as it satisfies the two-cocycle condition\nz sg h,kz \u22121 gh,kzg,hkz \u22121 g,h = 1 (76)\nfor g, h, k \u2208 G, where U(1)s means the left module defined as g.z = zsg for g \u2208 G on z \u2208 U(1). Under these preparations, we consider a loop, parameterized by \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], of injective MPS {Ai(\u03b8)}i in the canonical form and with G symmetry which starts and ends at the same physical state in the sense that {Ai(2\u03c0)}i \u223c {Ai(0)}i. Along the loop, the G action on the Hilbert space is assumed to be in common. As mentioned in Sec. III A 2, there always exists a global gauge so that Ai(2\u03c0) = Ai(0) holds, however, the\n18\nfollowing discussion does not change irrespective of whether Ai(2\u03c0) = Ai(0) holds or not. For \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], we have U(1) matrices ei\u03b2g(\u03b8) and U(n) phases Vg(\u03b8) from the relations\u2211\nj\n[ug]ij [A j(\u03b8)]sg = ei\u03b2g(\u03b8)Vg(\u03b8) \u2020Ai(\u03b8)Vg(\u03b8) (77)\nfor g \u2208 G. From Vg(\u03b8)s, we have a parameter family of two-cocycle zg,h(\u03b8) \u2208 Z2(G,U(1)s) which may not be 2\u03c0-periodic zg,h(2\u03c0) 6= zg,h(0) but relates with each other with a one-coboundary. To see this, applying the fundamental theorem to {Ai(2\u03c0)} and {Ai(0)}, we get\nAi(2\u03c0) = ei\u03b3W \u2020Ai(0)W (78)\nwith ei\u03b3 \u2208 U(1) and W \u2208 U(n). The G action on both the sides leads to the equality\nAi(2\u03c0) = e\u2212i\u03b2g(2\u03c0)eisg\u03b3ei\u03b2g(0)Vg(2\u03c0)[W \u2020]sgVg(0) \u2020Ai(0)Vg(0)W sgVg(2\u03c0) \u2020 (79)\nfor g \u2208 G. Then the uniqueness of ei\u03b2 and W gives us\nei\u03b2g(2\u03c0) = ei(sg\u03b3\u2212\u03b3)e\u03b2g(0), (80)\nand\nVg(2\u03c0) = e i\u03c6gW \u2020Vg(0)W sg (81)\nwith ei\u03c6g \u2208 U(1). Therefore, we have\nzg,h(2\u03c0) = e isg\u03c6he\u2212i\u03c6ghei\u03c6gzg,h(0). (82)\nIntroducing a lift C1(G,Rs/2\u03c0Zs) 3 \u03c6g 7\u2192 \u03c6\u0303g \u2208 C1(G,Rs), we define the following quantity\nng,h = 1\n2\u03c0 (\u03b4\u03c6\u0303)g,h \u2212\n1\n2\u03c0i \u222b 2\u03c0 0 d log zg,h(\u03b8). (83)\nThe relation (82) implies that ng,h is a two-cocycle of Z 2(G,Zs). The change of lift \u03c6\u0303g \u2192 \u03c6\u0303g + 2\u03c0bg with one-cochains bg \u2208 C1(G,Zs) gives the shift ng,h 7\u2192 ng,h + (\u03b4b)g,h. Therefore, ng,h is well-defined only as a cohomology group H2(G,Zs). It is also shown that n is invariant under changes of the U(1) phases of Vg(\u03b8). Therefore, [n] \u2208 H2(G,Zs) \u223c= H1(G,U(1)s) is a topological invariant of adiabatic pumps.\nWe comment on the simplification of the topological invariant [n] for the two cases. When the two-cocycle zg,h(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0-periodic as e i\u03c6g \u2261 1, ng,h is recast as the phase winding ng,h = \u2212 12\u03c0i \u222e d log zg,h(\u03b8) [13]. When the two-cocycle zg,h(\u03b8) is constant for \u03b8, then (82) means that e i\u03c6g is a one-dimensional representation of G, and this is nothing but the topological invariant [ei\u03c6] \u2208 H1(G,U(1)s).\nB. Fermionic MPS\nFermionic MPSs (fMPSs) were first introduced in [32] and developed in [12]. In this paper, we adapt the formulation in [12, 33]. See also [34] on an application of fMPS to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorems for Majorana fermion systems. For the classification of 1+1-dimensional fermionic SRE states without restricting SRE states to the class of the fMPS, see [35].\n1. Preliminary\nLet us consider a 1-dimensional fermionic system with L sites. We denote the creation/annihilation operator of complex fermions at cite k by a\u2020k,f/ak,f for f = 1, . . . , NF , where NF is the number of flavors. 8 We\n8 Note that if spin degrees of freedom coexist, they can be regarded as internal degrees of freedom of complex fermions.\n19\nintroduce the following shorthand notations:\nik = (ik,1, . . . , ik,NF ) \u2208 {0, 1}\u00d7NF , (84)\n|ik| = NF\u2211 f=1 |ik,f | (mod 2) \u2208 {0, 1}, (85) (a\u2020k) ik = (a\u2020k1) ik,1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (a\u2020kF ) ik,NF , (86) |i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iL\u3009 = (a\u20201)i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (a \u2020 L) iL |0\u3009 , (87)\nwhere |0\u3009 is the Fock vacuum defined by ak,f |0\u3009 = 0 for all possible ks and fs. The index i per site runs over N = 2NF possible combinations of (i1, . . . , iNF ). Similarly to the bosonic MPS, we also denote it by i \u2208 {1, . . . , N} equipped with the definite parity |i| \u2208 {0, 1}. A fermionic state is written as |\u03c8\u3009 =\u2211 {ik} \u03c8(i1, . . . , iL) |i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 iL\u3009 with \u03c8(i1, . . . , iL) the wave function in the occupation basis. We define the\nfermion parity operator (\u22121)F by (\u22121)F = \u220f k,f (\u22121)\na\u2020k,fak,f , and assume that |\u03c8\u3009 has a definite fermion parity (\u22121)F |\u03c8\u3009 = (\u22121)|\u03c8| |\u03c8\u3009, (\u22121)|\u03c8| \u2208 {\u00b11}, which implies that only wave functions \u03c8(i1, . . . , iL) satisfying the constraint (\u22121) \u2211L j=1 |ij | = (\u22121)|\u03c8| can be nonzero. We also define the translation operators for the periodic boundary condition (PBC) and the anti-periodic boundary condition (APBC) by\nTPa \u2020 k,fT \u22121 P = a \u2020 k+1,f for k = 1, . . . , L\u2212 1, TPa \u2020 L,fT \u22121 P = a \u2020 1,f , TP |0\u3009 = |0\u3009 , (88)\nand\nTAPa \u2020 k,fT \u22121 AP = a \u2020 k+1,f for k = 1, . . . , L\u2212 1, TAPa \u2020 L,fT \u22121 AP = \u2212a \u2020 1,f , TAP |0\u3009 = |0\u3009 , (89)\nrespectively, and assume that |\u03c8\u3009 is invariant under translation both under PBC and APBC,\nTP |\u03c8\u3009P = |\u03c8\u3009P \u21d4 \u03c8(i1, i2, . . . , iL) = (\u22121) |i1|(|\u03c8|+1)\u03c8(i2, . . . , iL, i1), (90)\nand\nTAP |\u03c8\u3009AP = |\u03c8\u3009AP \u21d4 \u03c8(i1, . . . , iL) = (\u22121) |i1||\u03c8|\u03c8(i2, . . . , iL, i1) (91)\nfor any system size L 9. Fermionic unique gapped ground states in 1+1 dimension are classified by Z/2Z [10], and when they are translational invariant, TP/AP |\u03c8\u3009P/AP = |\u03c8\u3009P/AP, the Z/2Z class is detected by the fermion parity under PBC [10]:\n(\u22121)F |\u03c8\u3009P = \u00b1 |\u03c8\u3009P . (92)\nFor APBC, irrespective of the Z/2Z-class, the fermion parity of the ground state is always even, i.e.,\n(\u22121)F |\u03c8\u3009AP = |\u03c8\u3009AP . (93)\n2. Fermionic MPS\nWe introduce translation invariant fMPSs in such a way that (90), (91), (92), and (93) are satisfied. In the case of fermionic systems, the local Hilbert space is Z/2Z-graded by the fermion parity\nhk = h (0) k \u2295 h (1) k , (94)\n9 For translation invariant fermionic states with fermion parity per site, irrespective of the Z/2Z-class, the Bloch momentum depends on the number L of sites as in TP |\u03c8\u3009P = (\u22121)L\u22121 |\u03c8\u3009P and TAP |\u03c8\u3009AP = (\u22121)L |\u03c8\u3009AP. Even when this is the case, by regarding two sites as a unit cell, the fermion parity per site can always be removed. Therefore, the assumption in the main text should not lose the generality for the purpose of studying pumps of fermionic states.\n20\nwhere the superscripts (0) and (1) indicate the even and odd fermion parities, respectively. The femrion anti-commutation relation implies that this space has the Z/2Z-graded tensor product which is a tensor product with the non-trivial braiding rule\nv \u2297gr w = (\u22121)|v||w|w \u2297gr v, (95)\nwhere v \u2208 V (|v|) and w \u2208 W (|w|) are elements of Z/2Z-graded vector spaces V and W with the fermion parities |v| and |w|. We call the basis that diagonalizes Z/2Z-grading the standard basis. The total Hilbert space is the Z/2Z-graded tensor product space H = \u2297 k hk.\nFor fMPSs, not only the physical Hilbert space, but also the bond Hilbert space V is Z/2Z-graded V = V (0) \u2295 V (1). V (0) and V (1) need not be of the same dimension, but to represent a nontrivial adiabatic pump, we assume dimV (0) = dimV (1) = n. We introduce the grading matrix Z such that Zv = (\u22121)iv for v \u2208 V (i) (i = 0, 1). It holds that Z2 = 12n and Z\u2020 = Z. To implement the fermion parity in fMPSs, we impose the following constraint on matrices {Ai}i,\n(\u22121)|i|Ai = ZAiZ (96)\nin the standard basis of the physical Hilbert space. In the basis of the bond Hilbert space V such that Z = \u03c3z \u2297 1n, the matrices Ai are in the forms as\nAi =\n( Bi\nCi\n) for |i| = 0, (97)\nAi =\n( Bi\nCi\n) for |i| = 1. (98)\nThen, an fMPS for {Ai}i is introduced as\n|{Ai}i,\u2126\u3009L := \u2211 {ik} tr[\u2126Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL ] |i1, ..., iL\u3009 \u2208 H, (99)\nwhere \u2126 is a matrix only with virtual legs, called the boundary matrix [12] to be determined depending on the boundary condition and the Z/2Z class of the state. For the fMPS to have a definite fermion parity, \u2126 is taken as Z\u2126 = \u00b1\u2126Z, i.e. Z\u2126 = \u2126Z for even parity, Z\u2126 = \u2212\u2126Z for odd parity. The translation invariance further constrains \u2126. Under APBC, from (93), the fermion parity of fMPSs should be even, so the translation invariance in (91) yields tr[\u2126Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL ] = tr[\u2126Ai2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiLAi1 ]. This condition is satisfied for the trivial boundary matrix \u2126 = 12n. However, under PBC, from (92), the fermion parity of fMPSs depends on the Z/2Z class, so does \u2126, which is determined so to obey the translation invariance in (90). We give the explicit construction of \u2126 for PBC in Sec.III B 3.\nWe here settle what kind of space we regard as the set of fMPSs. We abbreviate the unitary equivalence of two matrices A and B to A \u223cu B. Namely, A \u223cu B means there exists a unitary matrix U such that A = U\u2020BU .\nDefinition 2 (Space of fMPS). For a given local Hilbert space including fermions spanned by a standard basis |i\u3009, we define the space M\u0303fn of fMPSs with bond dimension 2n as sets of 2n\u00d72n matrices {Ai}i equipped with a grading matrix defined by (96). Explicitly,\nM\u0303fn := {{Ai}i|\u2203Z \u223cu \u03c3z \u2297 1n, s.t. (\u22121)|i|Ai = ZAiZ}. (100)\nWe note that the grading matrix Z is not unique in general. We introduce the gauge equivalence condition in the space of fMPSs as the equivalence of physical states in APBC.\n21\nDefinition 3 (Gauge equivalence condition of fMPS). We define that {Ai}i, {Bi}i \u2208 M\u0303fn are gauge equivalent {Ai}i \u223c {Bi}i if there exists a U(1) phase ei\u03b1L for any L \u2208 N such that\n|{Ai}i, 12n\u3009L = e i\u03b1L |{Bi}i, 12n\u3009L (101)\nholds. This is equivalent to the wave function equalities\ntr[Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL ] = ei\u03b1Ltr[Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL ] (102)\nfor any L \u2208 N and i1, . . . , iL.\nNote that this definition does not depend on the Z/2Z class of states, although as we will see later, the boundary matrix \u2126 in PBC depends on the Z/2Z class.\n3. Irreducible fMPS\nIn the next section, we introduce the injectivity of fMPS to represent fermionic unique gapped ground states with finite range correlation. Before doing so, it would be helpful to introduce the irreducibility of fMPSs [12, 33] as a necessary condition for the injectivity, in view of its relation to the graded algebra.\nA set of matrices {Ai}i \u2208 M\u0303fn generates an algebra A that is spanned by linear summations of products ci1,...,ilA i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail with ci1,...,il \u2208 C for l \u2208 N. The algebra A is a graded algebra A = A(0) \u2295 A(1)\nof which the grading is defined by \u2211l k=1 |ik| (mod.2) \u2208 {0, 1} for elements Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail 10. Thus, A(0) =\nSpan({Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail | \u2211l k=1 |ik| \u2261 0 (mod.2), l \u2208 N}), and A(1) = Span({Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail | \u2211l k=1 |ik| \u2261 1 (mod.2), l \u2208 N}). We note that grading matrices Z can be used to detect even and odd elements of A. If Za = aZ (Za = \u2212aZ) for a \u2208 A, then a \u2208 A(0) (a \u2208 A(1)).\nWe define a set of matrices {Ai}i \u2208 M\u0303fn to be graded irreducible if the graded algebra A generated by {Ai}i is graded central simple [12]. (We give a brief review on the graded central simple algebra in Appendix A 2.) Note that the above definition does not depend on choices of grading matrices Z. It is known that graded central simple algebras are classified into two types: (+)-algebra and (\u2212)-algebra [36]. For each type of algebra, there is a characteristic matrix u which is essentially unique up to a sign. We call the type of algebra the Wall invariant, and u the Wall matrix.\nIf A is a (+)-algebra, then A is central simple as an ungraded algebra. In addition, there is a unique element u \u2208 Z(A(0)) up to a phase factor so that u2 is proportional to 1 and u itself is not proportional to 1 [36]. Here, Z(A(0)) is the center of A(0). In terms of the matrices {Ai}i \u2208 M\u0303fn, the ungraded central simplicity of A is rephrased as that the set of all possible products of matrices Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail span the vector space M2n(C). This is equivalent to the absence of left invariant subspace of Ais, i.e., there is no proper projectors P such that AiP = PAiP holds for all i. The matrix u should be proportional to the grading matrix Z since Z \u2208 Z(A(0)). We note that the grading matrix Z is unique up to a sign. In fact, if Z \u2032 is also a grading matrix satisfying (96), then ZZ \u2032a = aZZ \u2032 holds true for any a \u2208 A \u223c= M2n(C). From the Schur\u2019s lemma we have ZZ \u2032 \u221d 1, thus, Z \u2032 = \u00b1Z. Along the line of thought above, we define the graded irreducibility with the Wall invariant (+) as follows.\nDefinition 4 (Irreducible fMPS with Wall invariant (+)). A set of matrices {Ai}i \u2208 M\u0303fn is graded irreducible with the Wall invariant (+) if the set of products Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail with all possible l \u2208 N and i1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , il span the vector space M2n(C). The grading matrix Z is unique up to a sign, and the Wall matrix u is given by u = \u00b1Z.\nIfA is a (\u2212)-algebra, thenA is not ungraded central simple butA(0) is ungraded central simple. In addition, there is a unique element u \u2208 Z(A)\u2229A(1) up to a phase factor so that u2 is proportional to 1 and A(0)u = A(1) [36]. In terms of matrices {Ai}i, A being the (\u2212)-algebra implies that there is a proper left invariant subspace\n10 Here, we impose that A has the unit element and A(0) and A(1) are non-zero.\n22\nof Ais. Let S1 be the left invariant subspace that contains no smaller left invariant subspaces of A is, and let P be the orthogonal projector onto S1. P satisfies P 2 = P, P \u2020 = P , and AiP = PAiP for all i. Let Z be a grading matrix satisfying (96). We find that [P,Z] 6= 0, otherwise, A is not graded central simple. From (96), Q = ZPZ is also an orthogonal projector onto a different ungraded left invariant subspace S2 = ZS1. It is found that PQ = 0, P +Q = 12n, P \u2212Q is unitary, the matrix u is given explicitly by u = P \u2212Q = 2P \u2212 1, and [u,Ai] = 0 for all i [12, 33]. In the basis where Z = \u03c3z \u2297 1n, solving u\u2020 = u, u2 = 1, {Z, u} = 0, u can be written as\nu =\n( U\u2020\nU\n) (103)\nwith U \u2208 U(n) a unitary matrix. Solving AiP = PAiP , we have\nAi = ( 1 U ) (\u03c3|i|x \u2297Bi) ( 1 U\u2020 ) (104)\nwhere Bis are n\u00d7 n matrices. The condition that A(0) is central simple and A(1) \u223c= A(0)u can be expressed for the matrices {Bi}i: Both the even subalgebra {Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Bil | \u2211l k=1 |ik| \u2261 0 (mod.2), l \u2208 N} and the odd\nsubalgebra {Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Bil | \u2211l k=1 |ik| \u2261 1 (mod.2), l \u2208 N} span the vector space Mn(C). Along the line of thought above, we define the graded irreducibility with the Wall invariant (\u2212) as follows.\nDefinition 5 (Irreducible fMPS with Wall invariant (\u2212)). A set of matrices {Ai}i \u2208 M\u0303fn is graded irreducible with the Wall invariant (\u2212) if there exists a unitary matrix u \u2208 U(2n) such that the following two conditions are fulfilled: (i) u is unitary equivalent to \u03c3x \u2297 1n. (ii) Let W \u2208 U(n) be a unitary matrix that diagonalizes u as u = W (\u03c3x \u2297 1n)W \u2020. Then, the matrices Ai are written as\nAi = W (\u03c3|i|x \u2297Bi)W \u2020, (105)\nand both the even subalgebra {Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Bil | \u2211l k=1 |ik| \u2261 0 (mod.2), l \u2208 N} and the odd subalgebra\n{Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Bil | \u2211l k=1 |ik| \u2261 1 (mod.2), l \u2208 N} span the vector space Mn(C).\nThe matrix u is unique up to a sign, as shown below. Suppose that u\u0303 = W\u0303 (\u03c3x \u2297 1n)W\u0303 \u2020 is another Wall matrix in Definition 5. The matrices Ai can also be written as Ai = W\u0303 (\u03c3 |i| x \u2297 B\u0303i)W\u0303 \u2020, and the even and odd subalgebras generated by {B\u0303i}i span Mn(C). Set X = W \u2020W\u0303 . We have\nX(12 \u2297 b\u0303) = (12 \u2297 b)X, (106) X(\u03c3x \u2297 b\u0303) = (\u03c3x \u2297 b)X (107)\nfor any b \u2208 Mn(C). Let us write X in a block form X = ( x y z w ) . If x is invertible, (106) leads to b\u0303 = x\u22121bx, and from the Schur\u2019s lemma we have y = \u03bb2x, z = \u03bb3x, z = \u03bb4x with \u03bb2, \u03bb3, \u03bb4 \u2208 C. Substituting them into (107), we get \u03bb4 = \u03b7 and \u03bb3 = \u03b7\u03bb2 with \u03b7 a sign \u03b7 \u2208 {\u00b11}. When x is noninvertible, one can show X is in\nthe form X = ( 0 y \u03b7y 0 ) with \u03b7 \u2208 {\u00b11}. Therefore, X can eventually be written as X = ( \u03bb1x \u03bb2x \u03b7\u03bb2x \u03b7\u03bb1x ) with \u03bb1, \u03bb2 \u2208 C and \u03b7 \u2208 {\u00b11}. We conclude that X\u03c3x = \u03b7\u03c3xX, and thus, u\u0303 = \u03b7u. The sign ambiguity of u is the origin of the Z/2Z-nontrivial pump in the (\u2212)-algebra. To see this, let us consider a periodic one-parameter family of the set of graded irreducible matrices {Ai(\u03b8)} in the basis such that Z = \u03c3z\u22971n. We have two orthogonal projectors P (\u03b8) and Q(\u03b8) which also depend on \u03b8. By a one cycle \u03b8 = 2\u03c0, the projector P (2\u03c0) is equal to either P (0) or Q(0), and the latter case indicates a nontrivial pump.\nNow we can represent a translation invariant fMPS with PBC by using the Wall matrix u as the boundary operator regardless of the type of the algebra (+) and (\u2212)[12]:\n|{Ai}i, u\u3009L = \u2211 {ik} tr(uAi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL) |i1, ..., iL\u3009 \u2208 H = \u2297 k hk. (108)\n23\nIt is easy to show TP |{Ai}i, u\u3009L = |{Ai}i, u\u3009L. Remark that an MPS given by a (+)-algebra is fermion parity even and an MPS given by a (\u2212)-algebra is fermion parity odd. Note also that although the Wall matrix u has sign ambiguity in general, it only affects the MPS by an overall sign, so the physical state is uniquely determined. We also introduce another equivalence condition in the space of fMPSs as the equivalence of physical states in PBC.\nDefinition 6 (Gauge equivalence condition of irreducible fMPS in PBC). We define that two irreducible fMPSs {Ai}i, {A\u0303i}i \u2208 M\u0303fn are gauge equivalent in PBC {Ai}i \u223cPBC {A\u0303i}i if there exists a U(1) phase ei\u03b1L for any L \u2208 N such that\n|{Ai}i, u\u3009L = e i\u03b1L |{A\u0303i}i, u\u0303\u3009L (109)\nholds. Here, u and u\u0303 are Wall matrices for {Ai}i and {A\u0303i}i, respectively. This is equivalent to the wave function equalities\ntr[uAi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL ] = ei\u03b1Ltr[u\u0303A\u0303i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A\u0303iL ] (110)\nfor any l \u2208 N and i1, . . . , iL.\n4. Injective fMPS and fundamental theorem\nFor each type of the Wall invariant, we further impose the following graded injectivity on graded irreducible fMPSs as follows, which we call the injective fMPS. One can show that an injective fMPS is essentially unique up to conjugate transformations. First, we discuss the case of (+)-algebra.\nDefinition 7 (Injective fMPS with Wall invariant (+)). A set of matrices {Ai}i \u2208 M\u0303fn is graded injective with the Wall invariant (+) if the set of all possible products of matrices Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail with a fixed l \u2208 N spans the vector space M2n(C). The grading matrix Z is unique up to a sign, and the Wall matrix u is given by u = \u00b1Z.\nBefore moving on to the fundamental theorem of injective fMPS, it is useful to introduce the canonical form of fMPS. Since {Ai}i is also ungraded irreducible, one can normalize {Ai} to be the canonical form [24]\u2211\ni\nAiAi\u2020 = 12n. (111)\nTheorem 3. (fundamental theorem for fMPS with Wall invariant (+)) Let {Ai}i and {A\u0303i}i be injective fMPSs with the Wall invariant (+) in the canonical form (111). They give the same physical state in APBC, in other words, {Ai}i \u223c {A\u0303i}i holds if and only if there exist a unitary matrix V \u2208 U(2n) and a U(1) phase ei\u03b2 \u2208 U(1) obeying that\nA\u0303i = ei\u03b2V \u2020AiV. (112)\nThe unitary matrix V is unique up to U(1) phase, and ei\u03b2 is unique.\nFurthermore, if we take the Wall matrices for {Ai}i and {A\u0303i}i to be u and u\u0303, respectively, they are connected by\nu\u0303 = \u03b7V \u2020uV (113)\nwith \u03b7 \u2208 {\u00b11} a sign. This theorem holds even if the assumption {Ai}i \u223c {A\u0303i}i is changed to {Ai}i \u223cPBC {A\u0303i}i.\nThe former part is the same as the fundamental theorem of injective MPS in Theorem 2, since {Ai}i and {A\u0303i}i are also ungraded injective. It is easy to show Eq.(113) as follows. Substituting (112) into the relation\n24\n(\u22121)|i|A\u0303i = u\u0303A\u0303u\u0303, we have A\u0303i = ei\u03b2 u\u0303V \u2020uAiuV u\u0303. The uniqueness of V and u\u03032 = 12n gives us (113). For a proof of PBC, see Appendix B.\nWe note that the sign \u03b7 depends on the choice of signs of u and u\u0303. Replacing the signs u and u\u0303 with u 7\u2192 \u00b5u and u\u0303 7\u2192 \u00b5\u0303u\u0303, \u03b7 changes to \u03b7 7\u2192 \u03b7\u00b5\u00b5\u0303. The sign \u03b7 plays the central role in the pump invariant. See Sec. V A.\nNext, we will discuss the case of (\u2212)-algebra.\nDefinition 8 (Injective fMPS with Wall invariant (\u2212)). A set of matrices {Ai}i \u2208 M\u0303fn is graded injective with the Wall invariant (\u2212) if there exists a unitary matrix u \u2208 U(2n) such that the following two conditions are fulfilled: (i) u is unitary equivalent to \u03c3x\u2297 1n. (ii) Let W \u2208 U(2n) be a unitary matrix that diagonalizes u as u = W (\u03c3x \u2297 1n)W \u2020. Then, the matrices Ai are written as\nAi = W (\u03c3|i|x \u2297Bi)W \u2020, (114)\nand both the even subalgebra {Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Bil | \u2211l k=1 |ik| \u2261 0 (mod.2)} and the odd subalgebra\n{Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Bil | \u2211l k=1 |ik| \u2261 1 (mod.2)} with a fixed l \u2208 N span the vector space Mn(C).\nThe matrix u is unique up to a sign. Since the matrices {Bi} is ungraded irreducible, one can normalize {Bi} to be the canonical form \u2211 iB iBi\u2020 = 1n, that is, we have the canonical form (111) for {Ai}i.\nTheorem 4. (Fundamental theorem for fMPS with Wall invariant (\u2212)) Let {Ai}i and {A\u0303i}i be injective fMPSs with the Wall invariant (\u2212) in the canonical form (111). They give the same physical state in APBC, in other words, {Ai}i \u223c {A\u0303i}i holds if and only if there exist a unitary matrix V \u2208 U(2n) and a U(1) phase ei\u03b2 \u2208 U(1) obeying that\nA\u0303i = ei\u03b2V \u2020AiV. (115)\nThe U(1) phase ei\u03b2 is unique. The unitary matrix V is unique up to multiplications V 7\u2192 ei\u03b8uV ei\u03c6u\u0303, where ei\u03b8u and ei\u03c6u\u0303 are any unitary matrices in the centers of the algebras generated by {Ai}i and {A\u0303i}i, respectively.\nFurthermore, if we take the Wall matrices for {Ai}i and {A\u0303i}i to be u and u\u0303, respectively, they are connected by\nu\u0303 = \u03b7V \u2020uV (116)\nwith \u03b7 \u2208 {\u00b11} a sign. This theorem holds even if the assumption {Ai}i \u223c {A\u0303i}i is changed to {Ai}i \u223cPBC {A\u0303i}i.\nWe sketch the proof. Set Ai = W (\u03c3 |i| x \u2297Bi)W \u2020 and A\u0303i = W\u0303 (\u03c3|i|x \u2297B\u0303i)W\u0303 \u2020. Correspondingly, the Wall matrices for {Ai}i and {A\u0303i}i are u = W (\u03c3x \u2297 1n)W \u2020 and u\u0303 = W\u0303 (\u03c3x \u2297 1n)W\u0303 \u2020, respectively. Then {Ai}i \u223c {A\u0303i}i ({Ai}i \u223cPBC {A\u0303i}i) implies that {\u03c3|i|x \u2297 Bi}i \u223c {\u03c3|i|x \u2297 B\u0303i}i ({\u03c3|i|x \u2297 Bi}i \u223cPBC {\u03c3|i|x \u2297 B\u0303i}i). In Appendix C, we prove the following lemma.\nLemma 1. Let {\u03c3|i|\u2297Bi}i and {\u03c3|i|x \u2297 B\u0303i}i be injective fMPSs with the Wall invariant (\u2212) in the canonical form (111). If either {\u03c3|i|x \u2297Bi}i \u223c {\u03c3|i|x \u2297 B\u0303i}i or {\u03c3|i|x \u2297Bi}i \u223cPBC {\u03c3|i|x \u2297 B\u0303i}i holds true, then there exist a U(1) phase ei\u03b2 , a unitary matrix v \u2208 U(n), and a sign \u03b7 \u2208 {\u00b11} such that\nB\u0303i = ei\u03b2\u03b7|i|v\u2020Biv. (117)\nMoreover, the U(1) phase ei\u03b2 and the sign \u03b7 are unique, and the unitary matrix v is unique up to U(1) phases.\nSetting V = W (\u03c3 1\u2212\u03b7 2\nz \u2297 v)W\u0303 \u2020 yields the desired relations (115) and (116). The matrix V is not unique. To see this, suppose that a unitary matrix V \u2032 \u2208 U(2n) also satisfies the relation (115) with the same U(1) phase\n25\nei\u03b2 . Then we have the equality (\u03c3x \u2297 Bi)W \u2020V V \u2032\u2020W = W \u2020V V \u2032\u2020W (\u03c3x \u2297 Bi). Since both the even and odd subalgebras generated by {Bi}i produces the matrix algebra Mn(C), the matrix W \u2020V V \u2032\u2020W can be written in the form W \u2020V V \u2032\u2020W = e\u2212i\u03b8\u03c3x \u2297 1n with \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. Therefore, V \u2032 = Wei\u03b8\u03c3xW \u2020V = ei\u03b8uV . This ambiguity of V does not affect the relation (116). Using (116), the ambiguity can also be written as ei\u03b8uV = V ei\u03b7\u03b8u\u0303.\nWe note that the sign \u03b7 depends on the choice of signs of u and u\u0303. Replacing the signs u and u\u0303 with u 7\u2192 \u00b5u and u\u0303 7\u2192 \u00b5\u0303u\u0303, \u03b7 changes to \u03b7 7\u2192 \u03b7\u00b5\u00b5\u0303. The sign \u03b7 plays the central role in the pump invariant. See Sec. V B.\nWe would like to point out that these theorems naturally includes the fermion parity symmetry\nAi 7\u2192 (\u22121)|i|Ai (118)\nwhen we take V = Z, a grading matrix and ei\u03b2 = 1.\nIn the rest of this section, we give three examples of a injective fMPSs.\n5. Example 1 : The Kitaev chain in the non-trivial phase\nLet\u2019s compute the MPS that represents the Kitaev chain [12]. In the case of \u03b8 = 0, the expression that characterizes the ground state of the Kitaev chain is eq.(20), which can be rewritten in terms of complex fermions as (\najaj+1 + a \u2020 jaj+1 \u2212 aja \u2020 j+1 \u2212 a \u2020 ja \u2020 j+1\n) |GS\u3009 = |GS\u3009 . (119)\nThis is a local condition. Therefore, if we denote the basis of the single particle Hilbert space by |0\u3009 and |1\u3009, and expand the state with respect to site j and j + 1 as\nx1 |0\u3009 |0\u3009+ x2 |0\u3009 |1\u3009+ x3 |1\u3009 |0\u3009+ x4 |1\u3009 |1\u3009 , (120)\nthe conditions on the coefficients are\nx1 = \u2212x4, x2 = x3. (121)\nTherefore, an fMPS of the Kitaev chain is given by\nA0 =\n( 1\n1\n) , A1 = ( \u22121\n1\n) . (122)\nIn fact, we can verify that A0A0 = \u2212A1A1 and A0A1 = A1A0 hold at the level of matrices, so we can see that the fMPS constructed from them satisfies the condition eq.(121). The algebra generated by these matrices is A ' CA0 \u2295 CA1 which is Z/2Z-graded central simple with the Wall invariant (\u2212). In this case, the Wall matrix u is given by\nu =\n( \u2212i\ni\n) , (123)\nup to a phase factor. Since it will be used in a later analysis, we will examine how the MPS changes with respect to the phase shift of the gap function. The phase shift of the gap function \u2206 7\u2192 ei\u03b8\u2206 can be regarded as that of the complex fermion\naj 7\u2192 ei \u03b8 2 aj a \u2020 j 7\u2192 e \u2212i \u03b82 a\u2020j , (124)\nso the conditions on coefficients are modified as\nx1 = \u2212e\u2212i\u03b8x4, x2 = x3. (125)\nTherefore, for example, the MPS of the Kitaev chain for general \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] is given by\nA0 =\n( 1\n1\n) , A1 = e i\u03b8 2 ( \u22121\n1\n) , u = ( \u22121\n1\n) . (126)\n26\n6. Example 2 : A Domain Wall Counting Model\nLet\u2019s compute an fMPS matrices of a domain wall counting model which is introduced in Sec.II C 1. By introducing the Majorana fermion ci, the Hamiltonian Eq.(39) recast into\nH(\u03b8) = \u2211 j \u22121 + cos(\u03b8) 2 ic2j\u22121c2j \u2212 1\u2212 cos(\u03b8) 2 ic2j\u22122c2j+1 \u2212 i sin(\u03b8) 2 (c2j\u22122c2j \u2212 c2j\u22121c2j+1), (127)\nfor \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. This Hamiltonian can be obtained from the Kitaev chain in the trivial phase by unitary transformation\nH(\u03b8) = \u2211 j U\u03b8(\u2212ic2j\u22121c2j)U\u2020\u03b8 , (128)\nwith a unitary operator U\u03b8 = \u220f j\u2208Z e \u2212i \u03b82 1+ic2jc2j+1 2 .\nAn fMPS of this Hamiltonian is given by\nA0(\u03b8) =\n( 1 ei \u03b8 2\nei \u03b8 2 1\n) , A1(\u03b8) = ( 1 ei \u03b8 2\n\u2212ei \u03b82 \u22121\n) . (129)\nIn order to obtain this matrices, we recall that the ground state in the open chain of this model was a state with a phase factor on the domain wall:\u2211\n\u03c32,...,\u03c3L\u22121\ne i\u03b8 2 NDW(1 + \u03c31a \u2020 1)(1 + \u03c32a \u2020 2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (1 + \u03c3La \u2020 L) |0\u3009 , \u03c3j \u2208 {\u00b11}, (130)\nwhere NDW = \u2211 j 1\u2212\u03c3j\u03c3j+1 2 . This is a variant of the cluster model, and fMPS matrices for the state (130) is given by\nB\u03b8,+ =\n( 1 ei \u03b8 2\n0 0\n) , B\u03b8,\u2212 = ( 0 0\nei \u03b8 2 1\n) , (131)\nin the basis of |\u03c31 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c3L\u3009 = (1+\u03c31a\u20201) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (1+\u03c3La \u2020 L) |0\u3009. When \u03b8 6= 0, the algebra generated by these matrices is A ' M2(C) which is Z/2Z-graded central simple with the Wall invariant (+). In this case, the Wall matrix u is given by\nu =\n( 1\n1\n) (132)\nup to a sign.11 When \u03b8 = 0, the algebra A ' C. This is a central simple algebra, but the odd part is zero. In this case, u which is not proportional to 1 does not exist, so we will take 1 as the boundary operator. Therefore the ground states with anti-periodic boundary condition is\u2211\n{\u03c3k}\ntr(uB\u03b8,\u03c31 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7B\u03b8,\u03c3L) |\u03c31, ..., \u03c3L\u3009 . (133)\n11 Since Z/2Z-grading is given by whether the fermion parity is even or odd, it gives the action of swapping + and \u2212 in the \u03c3 = \u00b1 basis. This is confirmed by the fact that the MPS in the occupation basis is given by A0(\u03b8) = B\u03b8,+ + B\u03b8,\u2212 and A1(\u03b8) = B\u03b8,+ \u2212B\u03b8,\u2212, as we will see later.\n27\nRewriting this into a basis of fermion occupation basis, we get\u2211 {\u03c3k} tr(uB\u03b8,\u03c31 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7B\u03b8,\u03c3L) |\u03c31, ..., \u03c3L\u3009 = \u2211 {\u03c3k} tr(uB\u03b8,+B\u03b8,\u03c32 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7B\u03b8,\u03c3L) |+, \u03c32, ..., \u03c3L\u3009\n+ \u2211 {\u03c3k} tr(uB\u03b8,\u2212B\u03b8,\u03c32 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7B\u03b8,\u03c3L) |\u2212, \u03c32, ..., \u03c3L\u3009 (134)\n= \u2211 {\u03c3k} tr(u(B\u03b8,+ +B\u03b8,\u2212)B\u03b8,\u03c32 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7B\u03b8,\u03c3L) |0, \u03c32, ..., \u03c3L\u3009\n+ \u2211 {\u03c3k} tr(u(B\u03b8,+ \u2212B\u03b8,\u2212)B\u03b8,\u03c32 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7B\u03b8,\u03c3L) |1, \u03c32, ..., \u03c3L\u3009 (135)\n= \u2211 {\u03c3k,i1} tr(uAi1(\u03b8)B\u03b8,\u03c32 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7B\u03b8,\u03c3L) |i1, \u03c32, ..., \u03c3L\u3009 , (136)\nwhere i1 = 0, 1 and\nA0(\u03b8) = B\u03b8,+ +B\u03b8,\u2212 =\n( 1 ei \u03b8 2\nei \u03b8 2 1\n) , A1(\u03b8) = B\u03b8,+ \u2212B\u03b8,\u2212 = ( 1 ei \u03b8 2\n\u2212ei \u03b82 \u22121\n) . (137)\nBy applying this operation to all sites, finally we get the fMPS representation with matrices\nA\u25e6(\u03b8) =\n( 1 ei \u03b8 2\nei \u03b8 2 1\n) , A\u2022(\u03b8) = ( 1 ei \u03b8 2\n\u2212ei \u03b82 \u22121\n) , u = ( 1\n1\n) . (138)\nIf we diagonalize u, we obtain\nA0(\u03b8) =\n( 1 + ei \u03b8 2\n1\u2212 ei \u03b82\n) , A1(\u03b8) = ( 1\u2212 ei \u03b82\n1 + ei \u03b8 2\n) , u = ( 1 \u22121 ) . (139)\n7. Example 3 : The Gu-Wen model\nLet\u2019s compute an fMPS of the Gu-Wen model [37][38] as an example of graded irreducible fMPS. The Hamiltonian of this model is defined by\nHGu-Wen = \u2212 \u2211 j (a\u2020j \u2212 aj)\u03c4 x j+ 12 (aj+1 + a \u2020 j+1)\u2212 \u2211 j \u03c4zj\u2212 12 (1\u2212 2a\u2020jaj)\u03c4 z j+ 12 , (140)\nwhere \u03c4x, \u03c4y and \u03c4z are the Pauli matrices. This model has a Z/2Z\u00d7 Z/2Z symmetry generated by Uspin =\u220f j\u2208Z+ 12 \u03c4x and Ufermion = \u220f j\u2208Z(1 \u2212 2a \u2020 jaj). This model can be obtained by applying the Jordan-Wigner transformation to one of the Z/2Z of Z/2Z\u00d7Z/2Z symmetry of the cluster model described in Section III A. First, we investigate the ground state of the Gu-Wen model. Any terms of the Hamiltonian commutes with each others, and the eigenvalue is \u00b11. We call the first term in Eq.(140) as the fluctuation term and the second term as the configuration term. The configuration term is minimized by placing fermions only at domain walls of spins:\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2193 \u2022 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u2022 \u2193 \u25e6 \u2193 \u2022 \u2191 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (141)\nwhere \u25e6 (resp. \u2022) denote the state without (resp. with) fermion and \u2191 (resp. \u2193) denote the state whose eigenvalue of \u03c4z is 1 (resp. \u22121). We call such a state the decorated domain wall (DDW) state [39].\nThe fluctuation term, on the other hand, map a DDW state to another DDW state by the following processes:\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2191 \u2022 \u2193 \u2022 \u2191 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (142) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u2022 \u2193 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2191 \u2022 \u2193 \u25e6 \u2193 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (143)\n28\nBecause no additional weight is given to the state by the fluctuation term, the ground state is given by the summation of all DDW states with the equal weights. The ground state is unique and gapped, so it is an SRE state,\nThe MPS of this ground state is given as follows: Corresponding to the \u2191, \u2193, \u25e6 and \u2022 configurations in Eq.(141), we introduce A\u2191, A\u2191, B\u25e6 and B\u2022. Here, the Z/2Z-grading is even for A\u2191, A\u2193, B\u25e6 and odd for B\u2022. Since the ground state is invariant under the maps in Eqs. (142) and (143), these matrices obey\n\u2191 \u2022 \u2193 \u2022 \u2191 = \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u2190\u2192 A\u2191B\u2022A\u2193B\u2022A\u2191 = A\u2191B\u25e6A\u2191B\u25e6A\u2191 (144) \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u2022 \u2193 = \u2191 \u2022 \u2193 \u25e6 \u2193 \u2190\u2192 A\u2191B\u25e6A\u2191B\u2022A\u2193 = A\u2191B\u2022A\u2193B\u25e6A\u2193 (145)\nand all other products are zero. In the standard basis of the entanglement spaces, these matrices are written as\nA\u2191 =\n( a\u2191\nb\u2191\n) , A\u2193 = ( a\u2193\nb\u2193\n) , B\u25e6 = ( a\u25e6\nb\u25e6\n) , B\u2022 = ( a\u2022\nb\u2022\n) (146)\nso the above conditions read\nb\u2193 = a\u2191 = 0, a\u25e6a\u25e6a\u2191 = \u00b1b\u2022b\u2193a\u2022, (147) b\u2193b\u25e6 = \u00b1a\u25e6a\u2191, b\u25e6b\u25e6b\u2193 = \u00b1a\u2022a\u2191b\u2022, (148)\nWhen the matrix size is 2, we can easily solve the above relation as\nA\u2191 =\n( 1\n0\n) , A\u2193 = ( 0\n1\n) , B\u25e6 = ( 1\n1\n) , B\u2022 = ( 1\n1\n) . (149)\nThe algebra generated by these matrices is A ' M2(C) which is central simple with the Wall invariant (+). In this case, the Wall matrix u is given by\nu = ( 1 \u22121 ) (150)\nup to a sign.\nIV. COMPUTATION OF THE SPACE OF SRE STATES USING FMPS\nIn this section, we compute the topology of the space of injective fMPSs for a few cases. Our strategy is as follows. First, let M\u0303n,N be the set of N pairs of 2n \u00d7 2n matrices {Ai}Ni=1 such that they are graded injective in the canonical form:\nM\u0303injn,N = {{A i}Ni=1 \u2208 M\u0303fn | {Ai}Ni=1 is injective fMPS and in the canonical form}. (151)\nFor a fermionic system with NF flavors, N = 2 NF . Let A be the graded algebra generated by the set of matrices {Ai}Ni=1. By Wall\u2019s structure theorem (App.A 2 Thm.8), a Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra is isomorphic to either M2n(C) (called (+)-type) or Mn(C) \u2295 Mn(C) (called (\u2212)-type), which physically correspond to the trivial and non-trivial fermionic SPT phases, respectively [12, 36]. Thus M\u0303injn,N consists of two connected components\nM\u0303injn,N = M\u0303 triv. n,N t M\u0303 non-triv.n,N , (152)\ndefined as\nM\u0303triv.n,N = {{Ai}Ni=1 \u2208 M\u0303 inj n,N | A := Span({A i}) ' M2n(C)} (153)\nand\nM\u0303 non-triv.n,N = {{Ai}Ni=1 \u2208 M\u0303 inj n,N | A = Span({A i}) ' Mn(C)\u2295Mn(C)}. (154)\n29\nAs we saw in Sec.III B 4, injective fMPS has gauge redundancy. Thus it is necessary to divide M\u0303injn,N by the gauge redundancy, and then we can obtain an approximate space Mn,N of the space of SRE states M:\nMn,N ' M\u0303injn,N / \u223c . (155)\nAnd finally, by taking n and N large enough, one would expect to obtain the space of SRE states M. Although determining such a space is in general difficult, it is possible in the non-trivial phase to perform a specific analysis under appropriate assumptions, as we will see later. Thus, in the following sections, we determine the space of injective fMPSs with the Wall invariant (\u2212) for several cases with small matrix sizes n and compute the fundamental group of it. A more general characterization of the pump in the trivial and non-trivial phases is given in Sec.V.\nA. Gauge-fixing condition\nWe compute the space Mnon-triv.n,N = M\u0303non-triv.n,N / \u223c for a few cases with small matrix sizes. By taking the unitary matrix V \u2208 U(2n) in Theorem 4 to be W itself, the matrices Ai can be in the form\nAi = \u03c3|i|x \u2297Bi. (156)\nUnder this gauge-fixing condition, the Wall matrix is given by\nu = \u00b1\u03c3x \u2297 1n, (157)\nand from Lemma 1, the residual gauge transformation is given by\nBi \u223c ei\u03b2\u03b7|i|v\u2020Biv, (158)\nwhere ei\u03b2 , v, and \u03b7 are U(1) phase, U(n) matrix, and a sign, respectively. We note that the gauge transformation Bi \u223c (\u22121)|i|Bi is nothing but the fermion parity symmetry. The condition for the matrices {\u03c3|i|x \u2297Bi}Ni=1 to be in the canonical form (111) is\nN\u2211 i=1 BiBi\u2020 = 1n. (159)\nB. For 2\u00d7 2 Matrices and 1-flavor i.e. n = 1, NF = 1\nConsider the above problem for 2 \u00d7 2 matrices and 1-flavor (i.e. n = 1, NF = 1). Under the gauge-fixing condition (156), the matrices A0, A1 are given by\nA0 = 1\u221a\n|a0|2 + |a1|2\n( a0\na0\n) , A1 =\n1\u221a |a0|2 + |a1|2\n( a1\na1\n) , a0, a1 \u2208 C. (160)\nThe graded injectivity requires a0 6= 0 and a1 6= 0. Using the residual gauge transformation by ei\u03b2 \u2208 U(1), a0 can be a real positive number a0 > 0. Furthermore, since A0 and A1 depend only on the ratios a0/|a0|, a1/|a0|, a0 can be set as a0 = 1. We considered the case where both a0 and a1 are non-zero because, in fact, the fMPSs with a0 = 0 or a1 = 0 are \u2297 |0\u3009 and \u2297 |1\u3009 respectively, which belong to the trivial phase. As a result, the parameters of the fMPS are in C \u222a {\u221e} \u223c= S2. Thus, at this stage, the space M\u0303non-trivialn=1,N=2 is recast as the two-dimensional sphere minus the north and south poles S2\\2pts. (Figure 4 [Left]). The remaining gauge transformation is the fermion parity symmetry Ai 7\u2192 (\u22121)|i|Ai, which leads to the identification a1 \u223c \u2212a1. This transformation acts on the space S2\\2pts. by swapping the antipodal points at each circle that appears when the sphere is cut by a constant latitude plane, which results in the topologically same space S2\\2pts.. Now we have identified all gauge redundancy, and the space of injective fMPSs in the non-trivial phase Mnon-trivialn=1,N=2 is homotopic to a sphere with two points removed S2\\2pts (Figure 4 [Right]).\n30\nLet\u2019s compute the classification of the Thouless pump in non-trivial phases. Mnon-trivialn=1,N=2 := S2\\2pts. corresponds to the non-trivial phase and its fundamental group is isomorphic to Z:\n\u03c01(Mnon-trivialn=1,N=2 ) ' Z (161)\nThis result suggests the existence of a non-trivial Thouless pump classified by Z. It can be seen that the 2\u03c0 rotation of the gap function of the Kitaev chain defines a path \u2223\u2223a1\u2223\u2223 = 1 in Mnon-trivialn=1,N=2 (see Section III B 5), which defines the generator of the fundamental group above. In the case of a free fermionic system, such a path of the Kitaev chain also generates a non-trivial Thouless pump [9] and, in particular, when the flavor number is 1, it is known that pumps are classified by Z generated by the loop. Therefore, this result is consistent with [9]. We also calculated the Berry phase of the ground state for the non-trivial path in this space, and confirmed that the ratio of the values calculated under the periodic boundary condition and the anti-periodic boundary condition converges to \u22121 in the limit of increasing the size of the system. See Appendix F for details of the calculation.\nC. For 2\u00d7 2 Matrices and generic flavors i.e. n = 1, NF > 1\nKeep the size of the matrix 2\u00d7 2 (i.e. n = 1) and firstly consider the case of 2-flavors (i.e. NF = 2)12. We define\nA00 = ( a a ) , A11 = ( b b ) , A10 = ( c c ) , A01 = ( d d ) , (162)\nwith a, b, c, d \u2208 C. The condition for the canonical form is\n|a|2 + |b|2 + |c|2 + |d|2 = 1. (163)\nThe graded injectivity is met if both the conditions (a, b) 6= (0, 0) and (c, d) 6= (0, 0) are satisfied. Here, we suppose that a 6= 0. Then, using the residual gauge transformation by ei\u03b2 \u2208 U(1), a0 can be a real positive number a0 > 0. Let us parameterize (a, b, c, d) by a real parameter t \u2208 (0, 1), unit 2-sphere (n1, n2, n3) \u2208 S2, and unit 3-sphere (n\u20321, n \u2032 2, n \u2032 3, n \u2032 4) \u2208 S3 as in\n(a, b) = t(n3, n1 + in2), (164) (c, d) = \u221a\n1\u2212 t2(n\u20321 + in\u20322, n\u20323 + in\u20324). (165)\n12 An example of a Hamiltonian corresponding to these fMPSs is given in Sec.VI B 2.\n31\nHere, t = 0, 1 are excluded from the graded injectivity. Also, a > 0 implies that (n1, n2, n3) runs only over the north hemisphere, namely, a disc D2. The gauge transformation Bi \u223c (\u22121)|i|Bi leads to the identification n\u2032 \u223c \u2212n\u2032, that is, we have the real projective space RP3 = S3/(n\u2032 \u223c \u2212n\u2032). Therefore, Mnon-trivn=1,N=4 = M\u0303non-trivn=1,N=4/ \u223c, the space of injective fMPSs with n = 1 and NF = 2 divided by the gauge transformation, is found as\nMnon-trivialn=1,N=4 \u223c= (0, 1)\u00d7D2 \u00d7 RP3, (166)\nand this is homotopy equivalent to RP3. It is easy to generalize the discussion above to generic flavor number NF > 1. The space Mnon-trivn=1,N=2NF>2 is homotopically equivalent to the real projective space RP 2NF\u22121. We get the first homotopy group 13\n\u03c01(Mnon-trivialn=1,N=2NF>2) ' Z/2Z. (167)\nThis result suggests the existence of a non-trivial Thouless pump classified by Z/2Z. In the case of the free Hamiltonian, a path that turns the phase of the gap function of the Kitaev chain (see Sec.III B 5) by 2\u03c0 generates a non-trivial Thouless pump and, in particular, when the number of flavors NF is 2 or more, it is known that pumps are classified by Z/2Z [9]. It can be seen that the the 2\u03c0 rotation of the gap function of the 2-flavor Kitaev chain model defines a path in \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] with a = 1/ \u221a 2, b = 0, c = ei\u03b8/2/ \u221a 2, d = 0 in Mnon-trivialn=1,N=4 (see Section VI), which defines the generator of the fundamental group above. Therefore, this result is reasonable.\nD. For 4\u00d7 4 Matrices and 1-flavor i.e. n = 2, NF = 1\nConsider the above problem for n = 2, NF = 1. It is difficult to analyze the case of 4 \u00d7 4 matrices in general. So we consider the following special case.\nA0 =\n( 12\n12\n) , A1 = ( 0 A\u03031\nA\u03031 0\n) , (168)\nfor arbitrary 2 \u00d7 2 matrix A\u03031. Since A0 is the unit matrix, the graded injectivity is the same as that the algebra A generated by the set of matrices {A0, A1} is graded central simple. In this case,the following theorem holds:\nTheorem 5. Let A be the algebra generated by A0 and A1. When A0 equals to the unit matrix, the following conditions are equivalent: (A) A is a Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra (B) (i)det(A\u03031) 6= 0 and tr(A\u03031) = 0 or (ii)det(A\u03031) 6= 0 and tr(A\u03031)2 \u2212 4tr(A\u03031) = 0 where A\u03031 is a 2\u00d7 2 matrix defined as the off-diagonal block element of A1.\nThe proof of this theorem is given in Appendix D. Using this theorem, we can determine the structure of a part of the space of MPS as follows:\n13 We will show in Sec.VI B 2 that a loop wrapped twice can be continuously transformed into a loop wrapped zero times, specifically in terms of Hamiltonians.\n32\nTheorem 6. Consider the same situation as in Theorem 5, and let M\u0303n\u22642,non-trivialN=2 |A0=14 be the space of MPS in this case. Then the topology of M\u0303n\u22642,non-trivialN=2 |A0=14 is\nM\u0303n\u22642,non-trivialN=2 |A0=14 \u223c R>0 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 {S2 \u222a Z/2Z}\nZ/2Zdiag \u2282 R>0 \u00d7U(2), (169)\nwhere Z/2Z is subgroup \u00b112 in SU(2) and Z/2Zdiag is center of U(2). In particular,\n(i) R>0 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 Z/2Z Z/2Zdiag \u2282 M\u0303n\u22642,non-trivialN=2 |A0=14 (170)\nis parameterized by\nA0 = 1\u221a\n1 + \u03bb2\n( 12\n12\n) , A1 =\n\u03bbei\u03b8\u221a 1 + \u03bb2  \u00b11 \u00b11\u00b11 \u00b11  (171) for \u03bb \u2208 R>0, \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), and\n(ii) R>0 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 S2\nZ/2Zdiag \u2282 M\u0303n\u22642,non-trivialN=2 |A0=14 (172)\nis parameterized by\nA0 = 1\u221a\n1 + \u03bb2\n( 12\n12\n) , A1 =\n\u03bbei\u03b8\u221a 1 + \u03bb2\n( 0 A\u03031\nA\u03031\n) , A\u03031 = ( i cos\u03c7 \u2212e\u2212i\u03d5 sin\u03c7 ei\u03d5 sin\u03c7 \u2212i cos\u03c7 ) (173)\nfor \u03bb \u2208 R>0, \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0), \u03d5 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0), \u03c7 \u2208 [0, \u03c0].\nThe proof of this theorem is given in Appendix E.\nFirst, consider the case (i). In this case, the matrix A1 is\nA1 = \u03bbei\u03b8  1 11 1  = \u03bbei\u03b8 ( 11 ) \u2297 12, (174)\nso this can be regarded as an embedding of the case n = 1. This is natural because a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix can represent a 2\u00d7 2 matrix and this component is ignored in the following. Therefore, the space of MPS in the case of n = 2 is essentially\nM\u0303n=2,non-trivialN=2 |A0=14 \u223c R>0 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 S2\nZ/2Zdiag . (175)\nNext, we consider the redundancy of the space M\u0303n=2,non-trivialN=2 |A0=14 . As in the case of n = 1, the action of fermion parity symmetry is\nAI 7\u2192 (\u22121)|I|AI , (176)\nand states are invariant under this transformation. Therefore, by dividing M\u0303n=2N=2 |A0=14 by this transformation, we obtain\nM\u0303n=2,non-trivialN=2 |A0=14 / Z/2Zdiag \u223c R>0 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 S2\nZ/2Zdiag\n/ Z/2Zf.p. \u223c R>0 \u00d7 RP1 \u00d7 RP2 (177)\n33\nNote that we used the following relation in the last equation:\nZ/2Zf.p. (ei\u03b8, U) \u223c (\u2212ei\u03b8, U)\nZ/2Zdiag \u223c \u223c Z/2Zdiag (\u2212ei\u03b8,\u2212U) \u223c (ei\u03b8,\u2212U)\nZ/2Zf.p.\n(178)\nHere the RP2 coordinates are redundancies that can be eliminated by unitary transformations and do not change the fMPS. In fact, the fMPS is given by\n|{Ai(\u03b8), u(\u03b8)}\u3009 = \u2211 {ik} tr ( uAi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL ) |i1, ...iL\u3009 = \u2211 {ik},odd ( \u03bbei\u03b8 )\u2211 k|ik| |i1, ...iL\u3009 , (179)\nso the fMPS does not depend on \u03c7 and \u03d5, which are coordinates of RP2. Therefore, the topology of the space of SRE states is\nMn=2,non-trivialN=2 |A0=14 \u223c R>0 \u00d7 RP 1. (180)\nThis has the same structure in the case of n = 1, N = 2, and the classification of the Thouless pump in the non-trivial phase is given by Z.\nV. INVARIANTS\nIn this section, we define the topological invariants that detect the pump in trivial (in Sec.V A) and nontrivial (in Sec.V B) phases. Each invariant is defined heuristically based on the free Hamiltonian model introduced in Sec.II B and Sec.II C. Applications of invariants to interacting systems are given in Sec.VI.\nA. Topological Invariant of Pump in the Trivial Phase\nThe pump invariant in the trivial phase is the same as the pump invariant for bosonic MPS with Z2 onsite symmetry constructed in Sec. III A 3.\nLet {Ai(\u03b8)}i for \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] be a family of injective fMPS with the Wall invariant (+) in the canonical form (111). Suppose that the physical state is periodic in the sense that {Ai(2\u03c0)}i \u223c {Ai(0)}i. Let u(\u03b8) for \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] be a continuous family of grading (Wall) matrices for {Ai(\u03b8)}i. By using Theorem 3, there exists a U(1) phase ei\u03b2 , a unitary matrix V , and a sign \u03b7\n(+) top \u2208 {\u00b11} such that\nAi(2\u03c0) = ei\u03b2V \u2020Ai(0)V, (181)\nu(2\u03c0) = \u03b7 (+) topV \u2020u(0)V. (182)\nSince u(\u03b8) is continuous for \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], the gauge transformation u(\u03b8) 7\u2192 \u00b5u(\u03b8) with \u00b5 \u2208 {\u00b11} does not change the sign \u03b7\n(+) top , meaning that the sign \u03b7 (+) top is gauge invariant. Thus, the sign \u03b7 (+) top defined in (182)\nserves as the topological invariant of pump.\nLet us compute the pump invariant \u03b7 (+) top for the domain wall counting model (127). As we saw in Sec.III B 6,\nwe have a gauge such that the fMPS is given by\nA\u25e6(\u03b8) = 1\n2\n( 1 + ei \u03b8 2\n1\u2212 ei \u03b82\n) , A\u2022(\u03b8) = 1\n2\n( 1\u2212 ei \u03b82\n1 + ei \u03b8 2\n) , u(\u03b8) = ( 1 \u22121 ) , (183)\nfor each \u03b8.14 We find that Ai(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0) = \u03c3xA i(\u03b8)\u03c3x. Therefore, the pump invariant is computed as \u03b7 (+) top = sign[u(\u03b8 + 2\u03c0)\u03c3xu(\u03b8)\u03c3x] = \u22121, as expected.\n14 This fMPS is not injective at \u03b8 = 0. However, since it can be made injective by an infinitesimal perturbation, the pump invariant \u03b7 is well-defined.\n34\nRelaxing the condition u(\u03b8)2 = 1 for the Wall matrix u(\u03b8), we obtain an alternative expression of the pump invariant. As discussed in Sec. III A 3, there always exists a 2\u03c0-periodic global gauge for {Ai(\u03b8)}, which we denote them by {A\u030ci(\u03b8)}, such that A\u030ci(2\u03c0) = A\u030ci(0) for all is. In the global gauge, the grading matrix u(\u03b8) is also 2\u03c0-periodic up to a U(1) phase. Namely, for the global gauge, there is a 2\u03c0-periodic unitary matrix u\u030c(\u03b8) such that\n(\u22121)|i|A\u030ci(\u03b8) = u\u030c(\u03b8)\u2020A\u030ci(\u03b8)u\u030c(\u03b8), (184)\nand u\u030c(\u03b8)2 \u221d 1 holds true. We have an integer-valued quantity n(+)top as the U(1) phase winding of u\u030c(\u03b8)2,\nn (+) top =\n1\n2\u03c0i\n\u222e d log tr[u\u030c(\u03b8)2] \u2208 Z. (185)\nThe 2\u03c0 periodicity of u\u030c(\u03b8), however, remains satisfied even after U(1) phase replacement u\u030c(\u03b8) 7\u2192 u\u030c(\u03b8)\u03b1(\u03b8) with a U(1) valued periodic function \u03b1(\u03b8). Under this replacement, the winding number n\n(+) top changes as\nn (+) top 7\u2192 n (+) top + 2m where m = \u222b d log\u03b1 \u2208 Z. Therefore, the winding number n(+)top is defined up to 2Z and n (+) top takes a value in Z/2Z. It can be shown that the two pump invariants \u03b7 (+) top and n (+) top are related to each other by \u03b7 (+) top = (\u22121)n (+) top .\nFor the domain wall counting model (127), with a gauge transformation, a 2\u03c0-periodic fMPS {A\u030ci(\u03b8)}i and a 2\u03c0-periodic Wall matrix u\u030c(\u03b8) are given by\nA\u030ci(\u03b8) = ei \u03c3x 2 \u03b8 2Ai(\u03b8)e\u2212i \u03c3x 2 \u03b8 2 , u\u030c(\u03b8) = ei \u03b8 2 ei \u03c3x 2 \u03b8 2Z(\u03b8)e\u2212i \u03c3x 2 \u03b8 2 . (186)\nThen u\u030c(\u03b8)2 = ei\u03b812 and the winding number is found to be n (+) top = 1.\nB. Topological Invariant of Pump in the Non-trivial Phase\nThe construction of the pump invariant in the non-trivial phase is parallel to that of the trivial phase. Let {Ai(\u03b8)}i for \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] be a family of injective fMPS with the Wall invariant (\u2212) in the canonical form (111), and we assume the physical state is periodic {Ai(2\u03c0)}i \u223c {Ai(0)}i. Let u(\u03b8) with the condition u(\u03b8)2 = 1 for \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] be a continuous family of the Wall matrices for {Ai(\u03b8)}i. By using Theorem 4, there exists a U(1) phase ei\u03b2 , a unitary matrix V , and a sign \u03b7 (\u2212) top \u2208 {\u00b11} such that\nAi(2\u03c0) = ei\u03b2V \u2020Ai(0)V, (187)\nu(2\u03c0) = \u03b7 (\u2212) top V \u2020u(0)V. (188)\nAs with the trivial phase, the sign \u03b7 (\u2212) top is gauge invariant and serves serves as the topological invariant of pump.\nLet us compute the pump invariant \u03b7 (\u2212) top for a free Kitaev chain model (23). As we saw in Sec.III B 5, the\n2\u00d7 2 fMPS of this Hamiltonian is given by\nA0(\u03b8) = 1\u221a 2\n( 1\n1\n) , A1(\u03b8) = e i\u03b8 2\n\u221a 2\n( \u22121\n1\n) , u(\u03b8) = ( \u2212i\ni\n) (189)\nfor each \u03b8. We have Ai(2\u03c0) = \u03c3zA i(0)\u03c3z, and thus, u(2\u03c0) = \u2212\u03c3zu(0)\u03c3z. The pump invariant is found as \u03b7 (\u2212) top = \u22121. In the same way as for the trivial phase, relaxing the condition u(\u03b8)2 = 1 for the Wall matrix u(\u03b8) gives us an alternative expression of the pump invariant. Suppose that we have a 2\u03c0-periodic global gauge of fMPS {A\u030ci(\u03b8)} satisfying A\u030ci(2\u03c0) = A\u030ci(0) for all is. In the global gauge, the Wall matrix u\u030c(\u03b8) without any constraint on the U(1) phase can also be 2\u03c0-periodic\nu\u030c(2\u03c0) = u\u030c(0). (190)\n35\nWe have an integer-valued quantity n (\u2212) top as the U(1) phase winding of u\u030c(\u03b8) 2 as in\nn (\u2212) top =\n1\n2\u03c0i\n\u222e d log tr[u\u030c(\u03b8)2] \u2208 Z. (191)\nThe replacement u\u030c(\u03b8) 7\u2192 u\u030c(\u03b8)\u03b1(\u03b8) with a U(1) valued periodic function \u03b1(\u03b8) yields n(\u2212)top 7\u2192 n (\u2212) top + 2m with m = \u222b d log\u03b1 \u2208 Z, implying that n(\u2212)top takes a value in Z/2Z. It is easy to see the two pump invariants \u03b7 (\u2212) top and n are related to each other by \u03b7 (\u2212) top = (\u22121)n (\u2212) top .\nFor the Kitaev chain model (23), a 2\u03c0-periodic fMPS {A\u030ci(\u03b8)}i and a 2\u03c0-periodic Wall matrix u\u030c(\u03b8) are given by\nA\u030ci(\u03b8) =\n( 1\nei \u03b8 2\n) Ai(\u03b8) ( 1\ne\u2212i \u03b8 2\n) , u\u030c(\u03b8) = ei \u03b8 2 ( 1\nei \u03b8 2\n) u(\u03b8) ( 1\ne\u2212i \u03b8 2\n) (192)\nwhere we put ei \u03b8 2 on the Wall matrix u so that u\u030c(\u03b8) is 2\u03c0-periodic. Then u\u030c(\u03b8)2 = ei\u03b812 and the winding number of the proportional constant is a nontrivial value\nn (\u2212) top =\n1\n2\u03c0i\n\u222b log tr(u\u0303(\u03b8)2) = 1. (193)\nC. Geometric Interpretation\nWe have defined invariants heuristically in the previous sections. From a geometric point of view, this topological invariant can be regarded as a monodromy. First, let me explain this interpretation.\nThe generalized Thouless pump is given by a loop \u03b3 = {|Ai(\u03b8)\u3009}0\u223c2\u03c0 in the set of SRE states M. When the state goes around the loop \u03b3, it returns to the original one, but the matrix representation of the MPS can only return to its original one up to a unitary, that is,\nAi(\u03b8 = 2\u03c0) = ei\u03b2V Ai(\u03b8 = 0)V \u2020 (194)\nfor some V and ei\u03b2 of the form in Thms.3 or 4. The space of SRE statesM can be constructed by dividing the space of MPS M\u0303 by redundancy. Let A(\u03b8) be the algebra generated by {Ai(\u03b8)} and AutZ/2Z(A) be the Z/2Z-grading preserving automorphism group of fMPS, which is generated by a unitary matrices of Thms. 3 or 4, that is,\nAutZ/2Z(A) = {V \u2208 PU(2n) | uV = V u} \u222a {V \u2208 PU(2n) | uV = \u2212V u} (195)\nand for both (+) and (\u2212) cases. We call an element of the first component of AutZ/2Z(A) an even unitary, and an element of the second component an odd unitary for both (+) and (\u2212) cases. Let s : AutZ/2Z(A)\u2192 Z/2Z be the function that measures whether it is even unitary or odd unitary. s is group homomorphism.\nThen, M\u0303 is the principal AutZ/2Z(A)-bundle over M\nAutZ/2Z(A)\u2192 M\u0303 \u2192M (196)\nand {A\u0303i(\u03b8)}0\u223c2\u03c0 gives the lift \u03b3\u0303 of \u03b3 in M\u0303. In particular, as a general theory of fiber bundles, it is known that the fundamental group of the base space acts on the fiber, that is, there exist a group homomorphism\nm : \u03c01(M)\u2192 AutZ/2Z(A) (197)\nAs we saw in Sec.V A and Sec.V B, if the topological invariant ntop. \u2261 0, then MPS matrices are glued with an even unitary matrix and if ntop. \u2261 1, then MPS matrices are glued with an odd unitary matrix. This means that s \u25e6m(\u03b3) coincide with ntop.. In other words, ntop. is an invariant that measures the Z/2Z monodromy for \u03b3.\n36\nSuch quantities are mathematically described as characteristic classes of the Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra bundle over a parameter space X = S1 [40]15. Here, a Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra bundle over X is a bundle over X whose typical fiber is a Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra. In the case of X = S1, such bundles are classified by characteristic class u1(A) defined in [36]. When going around the circle X = S1 from \u03b8 = 0 to 2\u03c0, u1(A) is defined as 1 if the fibers are glued together by an even unitary matrix, and \u22121 if they are glued together by an odd unitary matrix. Therefore, our topological invariant can be regarded as the characteristic class of Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra bundle u1(A) over S1.\nNote that these are invariants for families of SRE states, but are not detectable in the higher dimensional Berry curvature, which was recently proposed in [19, 20]. In fact, for 1 + 1 dimensional systems, the higher Berry curvature give an invariant for 3-parameter families and is an invariant for the free part of the integer coefficient cohomology, so the torsion part cannot be detected as in this case.\nVI. EXAMPLES OF THOULESS PUMP\nIn this section, we will calculate the invariants of pump formulated in the previous section for a concrete system.\nFirst, as an example of pumps in the trivial phase, we implement the Kitaev\u2019s canonical pump construction for the fermionic case and confirm the existence of the non-trivial pump (in Section VI A). We also show that a fermion parity pump can be obtained in the Gu-Wen model by rotating bosonic spins and give a physical interpretation of the pump (in Section VI A 2).\nNext, as an example of pumps in the non-trivial phase, we consider a loop that rotates the phase of the gap function of the Kitaev chain, and construct the corresponding families of fMPSs and verify the existence of the non-trivial pump (in Section III B 5). We also compute the fMPS of the multi-flavor Kitaev chain and give the homotopy of the Hamiltonian that transforms the model with winding number 1 into the model with winding number \u22121 (in Section VI B 2). This gives us a concrete confirmation that the classification of the pump in this model is given by Z/2Z.\nA. Examples of the Thouless Pump in the Trivial Phase\n1. Kitaev\u2019s Canonical Pump\nAs an example of the calculation of the pump in the trivial phase, we derive the fMPS describing the Kitaev pump:\n|\u03c7\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 (198)\u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 |\u03c7\u3009 |\u03c7\u0304\u3009 (199)\u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223 j \u2223\u2223\u2223 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 |0\u3009 (200)\nLet\u2019s consider the BdG Hamiltonian\nhmat(\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8)\u03c4z \u2212 sin(\u03b8)\u03c4x\u03c3y (201) where \u03c4 acts on Nambu space and \u03c3 acts on flavor space, and total Hamiltonian is defined by\nH(\u03b8) = \u2211 j hj(\u03b8) (202)\n15 We would like to thank Mayuko Yamashita for telling us about a Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra bundles and twists of K-theory.\n37\nwhere\nhj(\u03b8) = ( ai\u2020j , a i j ) hmat(\u03b8) ( aij ai\u2020j ) (203)\nd and i =\u2191, \u2193, and we regard \u2191 and \u2193 as odd site and even site, respectively. The ground state of the local Hamiltonian hj(\u03b8) is (\ncos( \u03b8\n2 ) + i sin(\n\u03b8 2 )a\u2191\u2020j a \u2193\u2020 j\n) |00\u3009j (204)\nwhere |00\u3009j is vacuum state at site j, defined by a \u2191 ja \u2193 j |00\u3009j = 0. Therefore, the variation of \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 gives the variation of ground state from |00\u3009j to |11\u3009j := a \u2191\u2020 j a \u2193\u2020 j |00\u3009j and regarding \u2191 and \u2193 as two sites, this is the half of the Kitaev pump from (200) to (199) in the case of |\u03c7\u3009 = |1\u3009. For the remaining half of the process, we perform the same transformation for one shifted site.\nIt is easy to compute the fMPS in each process and there is a 2\u00d7 2 representation labeled by i, j \u2208 {0, 1}\nA00 = cos( \u03b8\n2 ), A11 = i sin(\n\u03b8 2 ), A01 = 0, A10 = 0, (205)\nfor \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] and\nA00 =\n( cos( \u03b82 )\n0\n) , A11 = ( 0 i sin( \u03b82 ) ) ,\nA01 = ( \u221a cos( \u03b82 ) sin( \u03b8 2 )\n0\n) , A10 = ( 0\u221a\ncos( \u03b82 ) sin( \u03b8 2 )\n) , (206)\nfor \u03b8 = [\u03c0, 2\u03c0]. For \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0], this MPS is already in the canonical form. To get MPSs for \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03c0, 2\u03c0) to be in the canonical form, we only need to find a positive and invertible eigenmatrix of the CP map E(X) := \u2211 iA\niXAi\u2020 [24]. In fact, if we find a positive and invertible matrix X such that E(X) = X, then X\u2212 1 2AiX\u2212 1 2 is in the canonical form. In particular, the existence of such a matrix is always guaranteed when the MPS is central simple as ungraded algebra [24, 41]16. In the case of Eq.(206), we can easily check that\nX =\n( cos( \u03b82 )\nsin( \u03b82 )\n) is a positive and invertible eigenmatrix of the CP map. There fore, the canonical form\nof Eq.(206) is given by\nA00 =\n( cos( \u03b82 )\n0\n) , A11 = ( 0 i sin( \u03b82 ) ) ,\nA01 =\n( sin( \u03b82 )\n0\n) , A10 = ( 0\ncos( \u03b82 )\n) . (207)\nFor any \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], however, they are Z/2Z-graded central simple with the Wall invariant (+), in order to connect these matrices continuously, we embed the matrices at \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] in a 2\u00d7 2 matrix as follows:\nA00 =\n( 0\ncos( \u03b82 )\n) , A11 = ( 0 i sin( \u03b82 ) ) , A01 = ( sin( \u03b82 ) 0 ) , A10 = ( cos( \u03b82 ) 0 ) , (208)\nwhere we embed it in the (2, 2) component so that it is continuous at \u03b8 = \u03c0. Then the Wall matrix u is given by\nu \u221d (\n1 \u22121\n) , (209)\n16 The existence of a positive eigenmatrix X of the CP map is guaranteed in Ref.[41]. In the proof of Theorem 4 in Ref.[24], it is shown that {Ai} is reducible if X is non-invertible. Therefore, if {Ai} is central simple as ungraded algebra, X is invertible.\n38\nfor \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. Nevertheless, the size of the matrix algebra generated by the matrices still differs when \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] and \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0]. To avoid this difficulty, we introduce a perturbation terms\n\u03b4A00(\u03b8) = i cos( \u03b8\n2 )12, \u03b4A\n11(\u03b8) = sin( \u03b8\n2 )12, \u03b4A\n10(\u03b8) = \u03b4A01(\u03b8) = i (cos( \u03b8 2 )\u2212 sin(\u03b8 2 ))\u03c3x, (210)\nfor a small number and redefine\nAij(\u03b8) 7\u2192 A ij(\u03b8) + \u03b4Aij(\u03b8)\u221a\n1 + 2 + 2(cos( \u03b82 )\u2212 sin( \u03b8 2 ))\n(211)\nfor [0, 2\u03c0]. Here we chose these perturbation terms so that the fMPS after perturbation also represents the same state at \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = 2\u03c0. Note that the matrices are still in the canonical form. Since the algebra generated by the matrices is isomorphic to M2(C) for all \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], this is a perturbation within the trivial phase.\nSince this fMPS is not 2\u03c0-periodic as matrices, we perform the unitary transformation\nA\u0303ij(\u03b8) = { Aij(\u03b8) \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] ei(\u03b8\u2212\u03c0)e\u2212i \u03c3x 2 (\u03b8\u2212\u03c0)Aij(\u03b8)ei \u03c3x 2 (\u03b8\u2212\u03c0) \u03b8 \u2208 [\u03c0, 2\u03c0]\n(212)\nto compute the topological invariant of this pump17. Then we can take a 2\u03c0 periodic Wall matrix, for example\nu\u0303(\u03b8) =  ( 1 \u22121 ) (\u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0]) ei(\u03b8\u2212\u03c0)e\u2212i\u03c3x(\u03b8\u2212\u03c0) ( 1\n\u22121\n) (\u03b8 \u2208 [\u03c0, 2\u03c0])\n(213)\nand the topological invariant Eq.(185) is\nn (+) top \u2261\n\u222b d log tr(u\u03032) \u2261 1. (214)\nTherefore, this is a non-trivial pump in the trivial phase.\nThe algebraic pump invariant \u03b7 (+) top defined in (182) is equivalent to the pump invariant by the winding number, but this one is easier to compute. For the gauge Eqs.(207) and (208), the transition function at \u03b8 = 2\u03c0 is V = \u03c3x, and the Wall matrix is given in (209). Thus, the pump invariant is \u03b7 (+) top = \u22121, and this is consistent with Eq.(214).\n2. The Gu-Wen Model\nIn Section III B, we derive the fMPS of the Gu-Wen model. In this section, we show that a fermion parity pump can be obtained in the Gu-Wen model by rotating bosonic spins and give a physical interpretation of the pump.\nLet\u2019s consider the Hamiltonian H(\u03b8) = \u2212 \u2211 j (a\u2020j \u2212 aj)\u03c4 x j+ 12 (aj+1 + a \u2020 j+1)\u2212 \u2211 j \u03c4z,\u03b8 j\u2212 12 (1\u2212 2a\u2020jaj)\u03c4 z,\u03b8 j+ 12 , (215)\nwhere \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] and \u03c4z,\u03b8j is defined by\n\u03c4z,\u03b8j = e i \u03b82 \u03c4 x j \u03c4zj e \u2212i \u03b82 \u03c4 x j = ( cos (\u03b8) \u2212i sin (\u03b8) i sin (\u03b8) \u2212 cos (\u03b8) ) . (216)\n17 If we choose the perturbation terms \u03b4A10 and \u03b4A01 to be proportional to \u03c3x, we cannot take a gauge that is exactly 2\u03c0-periodic. In that case, however, the above gauge also gives a periodic MPS up to .\n39\nThe periodicity of \u03b8 is \u03c0. Let |\u2191\u3009\u03b8 and |\u2193\u3009\u03b8 be the eigenvectors of \u03c4z,\u03b8 with eigenvalues 1 and \u22121 respectively:\n\u03c4z,\u03b8 |\u2191\u3009\u03b8 = |\u2191\u3009\u03b8 , (217) \u03c4z,\u03b8 |\u2193\u3009\u03b8 = \u2212 |\u2193\u3009\u03b8 . (218)\nSince the action of \u03c4x on them is\n\u03c4x,\u03b8 |\u2191\u3009\u03b8 = |\u2193\u3009\u03b8 , (219) \u03c4x,\u03b8 |\u2193\u3009\u03b8 = |\u2191\u3009\u03b8 , (220)\nthe structure of the ground state is the same as in the original Gu-Wen model. Therefore, the fMPS of this model is \u2211\ntr(Ai1Bj1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiLBjL) |i1\u3009\u03b8 |j1\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |iL\u3009\u03b8 |jL\u3009 , (221)\nwhere the matrices are defined by\nA\u2191 =\n( 1\n0\n) , A\u2193 = ( 0\n1\n) , B\u25e6 = ( 1\n1\n) , B\u2022 = ( 1\n1\n) . (222)\nWe rewrite this fMPS in the basis of \u03c4z. Since |i\u3009\u03b8 = ei \u03b8 2 |i\u3009 for i =\u2191, \u2193,\n|\u2191\u3009\u03b8 = e i \u03b82 |\u2191\u3009 = cos (\u03b8 2 ) |\u2191\u3009+ i sin (\u03b8 2 ) |\u2193\u3009 (223)\nand\n|\u2193\u3009\u03b8 = e i \u03b82 |\u2193\u3009 = i sin (\u03b8 2 ) |\u2191\u3009+ cos (\u03b8 2 ) |\u2193\u3009 . (224)\nBy substituting eq.(223) and (224) in |i1\u3009 of eq.(221), we obtain\u2211 tr(Ai1Bj1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiLBjL) |i1\u3009\u03b8 |j1\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |iL\u3009\u03b8 |jL\u3009 (225)\n= \u2211\ntr(A\u2191Bj1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiLBjL)(cos (\u03b8 2 ) |\u2191\u3009+ i sin (\u03b8 2 ) |\u2193\u3009) |j1\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |iL\u3009\u03b8 |jL\u3009 (226)\n+tr(A\u2193Bj1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiLBjL)(i sin (\u03b8 2 ) |\u2191\u3009+ cos (\u03b8 2 ) |\u2193\u3009) |j1\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |iL\u3009\u03b8 |jL\u3009 (227)\n= \u2211\ntr(Ai1,\u03b8Bj1Ai2Bj2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiLBjL) |i1\u3009 |j1\u3009 |i2\u3009\u03b8 |j2\u3009 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 |iL\u3009\u03b8 |jL\u3009 , (228)\nwhere A\u2191,\u03b8 = cos ( \u03b82 )A \u2191 + i sin ( \u03b82 )A \u2193 and A\u2193,\u03b8 = i sin ( \u03b82 )A \u2191 + cos ( \u03b82 )A \u2193. By applying this operation to all sites, the fMPS of H(\u03b8) is given by\nA\u2191,\u03b8 =\n( cos ( \u03b82 )\ni sin ( \u03b82 )\n) , A\u2193,\u03b8 = ( i sin ( \u03b82 )\ncos ( \u03b82 )\n) , B\u25e6 = ( 1\n1\n) , B\u2022 = ( 1\n1\n) . (229)\nLet\u2019s compute the topological invariant of this fMPS. In order to have translational symmetry, we combine the sublattices into one and consider (i, j) as one site. Therefore we consider the following fMPS:\nC\u2191,\u25e6(\u03b8) = 1\u221a 2 A\u2191,\u03b8B\u25e6 = 1\u221a 2\n( cos ( \u03b82 )\ni sin ( \u03b82 )\n) , C\u2193,\u25e6(\u03b8) =\n1\u221a 2 A\u2193,\u03b8B\u25e6 = 1\u221a 2\n( i sin ( \u03b82 )\ncos ( \u03b82 )\n) , (230)\nC\u2191,\u2022(\u03b8) = 1\u221a 2 A\u2191,\u03b8B\u2022 = 1\u221a 2\n( cos ( \u03b82 )\ni sin ( \u03b82 )\n) , C\u2193,\u2022(\u03b8) =\n1\u221a 2 A\u2193,\u03b8B\u2022 = 1\u221a 2\n( i sin ( \u03b82 )\ncos ( \u03b82 )\n) . (231)\nIn order to make the matrices to be \u03c0-periodic, we perform a gauge transformation as follows:\nC\u0303i,j(\u03b8) = e\u2212i \u03b8 2 ei \u03b8 2\u03c3xCi,j(\u03b8)e\u2212i \u03b8 2\u03c3x , (232)\n40\nwhere \u03c3x =\n( 1\n1\n) acts on a virtual index of the fMPS. Then a \u03c0-periodic Wall matrix is given by\nu\u0303(\u03b8) = ei\u03b8ei \u03b8 2\u03c3x ( 1 \u22121 ) e\u2212i \u03b8 2\u03c3x = ei\u03b8ei\u03b8\u03c3x ( 1 \u22121 ) . (233)\nSince u\u0303(\u03b8)2 = \u2212ei2\u03b812, the topological invariant is n(+)top = 1. Therefore, {H(\u03b8)}\u03b8\u2208[0,\u03c0] has a non-trivial pump of the fermion parity.\nThe algebraic pump invariant \u03b7 (+) top defined in (182) is equivalent to the pump invariant by the winding number, but this one is easier to compute. In the gauge Eqs.(230) and (231), the transition function at \u03b8 = \u03c0 is given by V = \u03c3x, which anticommuets with the Wall matrix u(\u03b8) = \u03c3z. Therefore, the invariant is given by \u03b7 (+) top = \u22121.\nLet\u2019s consider the physical description of this pump. When \u03b8 = 0, the ground state contains a following configuration\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2191 \u2022 \u2193 \u2022 \u2191 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (234)\nwhere \u2191, \u2193 are bosonic spin and \u25e6 and \u2022 is fermion unoccupied and occupied state. Performing \u03c0-rotation on the middle spin, we obtain\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2193 \u25e6 \u2191 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2191 \u2022 \u2191 \u2022 \u2191 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (235)\nComparing two configurations eq.(234) and eq.(235), we can see that the fermion parity of both sides of the middle site is flipped. By applying this operation to even sites, the fermion parity of all fermions is flipped. This state corresponds to the intermediate state eq.(199) in the Kitaev pump. Then, by applying the same operation to odd sites, the fermion parity of all fermions is flipped again and the ground state return to the original state. This corresponds to the final state eq.(198) of the Kitaev pump. Therefore, if we consider a system with edges, the fermion parity is pumped to both edges of the system.\nAs a concrete example, consider a system with edges. Assuming that the number of sites is 4 and the spins at both edges are fixed to up as a boundary condition, then the ground state at \u03b8 = 0 is a superposition of\n\u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191, \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u2022 \u2193 \u2022 \u2191, \u2191 \u2022 \u2193 \u2022 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191, \u2191 \u2022 \u2193 \u25e6 \u2193 \u2022 \u2191, (236)\nand the ground state at \u03b8 = \u03c0 is a superposition of\n\u2191 \u2022 \u2191 \u25e6 \u2191 \u2022 \u2191, \u2191 \u2022 \u2191 \u2022 \u2193 \u25e6 \u2191, \u2191 \u25e6 \u2193 \u2022 \u2191 \u2022 \u2191, \u2191 \u25e6 \u2193 \u25e6 \u2193 \u25e6 \u2191 . (237)\nComparing configuration (236) and (237), we can see that the bulk (i.e. the middle fermion and two spins) is in the same state and the fermion parity flips only at both edges. This is nothing but a pumping of fermion parity and this result does not change when the number of sites is increased.\nB. Examples of the Thouless Pump in a the Non-trivial Phase\n1. The Interacting Kitaev chain in the non-trivial phase\nLet\u2019s consider the Kitaev chain with interactions H = \u2211 j \u2212t(a\u2020jaj+1 + a \u2020 j+1aj) + |\u2206| ( ajaj+1 + a \u2020 ja \u2020 j+1 ) \u2212 \u00b5 2 (2nj \u2212 1) + U(2nj \u2212 1)(2nj+1 \u2212 1), (238)\nwhere nj = a \u2020 jaj is a number operator at site j and U \u2265 0 is the strength of the nearest-neighbor repulsive interaction. It is known that the model is frustration-free [42], at\n\u00b5 = \u00b5\u2217 := 4 \u221a U2 + tU + t2 \u2212 |\u2206|2\n4 , (239)\n41\nand its ground state in PBC is given by\n|\u03c8odd\u3009 = e\u03bba \u2020 1e\u03bba \u2020 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 e\u03bba \u2020 L |0\u3009 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bba \u2020 1e\u2212\u03bba \u2020 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 e\u2212\u03bba \u2020 L |0\u3009 , (240)\nwhere \u03bb = \u221a\ncot(\u03c6\u2217/2) and \u03c6\u2217 = arctan(2 |\u2206| /\u00b5\u2217) [43, 44]. It is easy to check that the fMPS matrices of this ground state is given by\nA0 = 1\u221a\n1 + \u03bb2\n( 1\n1\n) , A1 =\ni\u03bb\u221a 1 + \u03bb2\n( \u22121\n1\n) u = ( \u22121\n1\n) . (241)\nIn fact, explicitly, the fMPS is |{Ai, u}\u3009 = \u2211 {ik} tr ( uAi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL ) |i1, ...iL\u3009 = \u2211 {ik},odd \u03bb \u2211 k|ik| |i1, ...iL\u3009 , (242)\nand this is nothing but the state Eq.(240) (up to a normalization factor). We can show that, as with the interaction-free Kitaev chain, this model gives rise to a fermion parity pump by rotating the phase of the gap function |\u2206| ei\u03b8. Actually, the fMPS matrices of this path is given by\nA0 = 1\u221a\n1 + \u03bb2\n( 1\n1\n) , A1 =\ni\u03bbei\u03b8\u221a 1 + \u03bb2\n( \u22121\n1\n) u = ( \u22121\n1\n) . (243)\nSimilar to the calculation in the case of free Kitaev chain (see Sec.V B), we can easily check that the pump invariants \u03b7 (+) top = (\u22121)n (+) top of this path is non-trivial.\nThis result indicates that the fermion parity pump is stable to the interaction.\n2. The Homotopy of the Hamiltonian\nLet\u2019s show that the two laps of the path that turns the phase of the Kitaev chain is a trivial path. For this purpose, it is sufficient to construct a homotopy that connects the model with a winding number of 1 to the one with a winding number of \u22121.\nFirst, consider a homotopy of fMPS. Let t \u2208 [0, \u03c0] be a parameter of the homotopy and at t = 0, the fMPS is given by\nA0(\u03b8) = 12, A 1,a(\u03b8) = ei \u03b8 2 i\u03c32, (244)\nwhere a is a label of a flavor and \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] is a parameter of the path. To deform this path, let\u2019s introduce a second flavor b and define\nA0(\u03b8, t) = 12, (245)\nA1,a(\u03b8, t) = (cos ( \u03b8\n2 ) + i sin (\n\u03b8 2 ) cos (t))i\u03c32, (246)\nA1,b(\u03b8, t) = i sin ( \u03b8\n2 ) sin (t)i\u03c32, (247)\nwhich will be\nA0(\u03b8, t) = 12, (248)\nA1,a(\u03b8, t) = (cos ( \u03b8 2 )\u2212 i sin (\u03b8 2 ))i\u03c32 (249)\nat t = \u03c0. By multiplying a by \u22121 using fermion parity symmetry, we get\nA0(\u03b8, t) = 12, (250)\n\u2212A1,a(\u03b8, t) = \u2212(cos (\u03b8 2 )\u2212 i sin (\u03b8 2 ))i\u03c32 = e \u2212i \u03b82 i\u03c32, (251)\n42\nwhich gives a model of winding \u22121. Next, consider a Hamiltonian which corresponds to the fMPS (245)-(247). Such a Hamiltonian is given by\nH(\u03b8, t) = \u2211 j a\u0303\u2020,aj (\u03b8, t)a\u0303 a j (\u03b8, t) + \u2211 j a\u2020,bj (\u03b8, t)a b j(\u03b8, t), (252)\nwhere complex fermions aaj (\u03b8, t) and a b j(\u03b8, t) are defined by(\naaj (\u03b8, t) abj(\u03b8, t)\n) = ( cos ( \u03b82 ) + i sin ( \u03b8 2 ) cos (t) i sin ( \u03b8 2 ) sin (t)\n\u2212i sin ( \u03b82 ) sin (t) \u2212 cos ( \u03b8 2 ) + i sin ( \u03b8 2 ) cos (t) )( aaj abj ) (253)\nand virtual complex fermion a\u0303a(\u03b8, t) is defined by replacing a and b with a\u0303 and b\u0303 in equation (253) respectively. Before showing that the ground state of this Hamiltonian is given by the MPS above, we note that this Hamiltonian is a homotopy connecting the Kitaev chain with a winding number of 1 and that with a winding number of \u22121. In fact, at t = 0, the Hamiltonian reads to\nH(\u03b8, t = 0) = \u2212 \u2211 j ( a\u2020jaj+1 + a \u2020 j+1aj + e i\u03b8ajaj+1 + e \u2212i\u03b8a\u2020j+1a \u2020 j ) + \u2211 j a\u2020,bj a b j , (254)\nSince the second term is a Kitaev chain in the trivial phase without \u03b8 dependence, it does not affect the pump. Therefore, this is a model with winding number 1. Similarly, at t = \u03c0, the Hamiltonian reads to\nH(\u03b8, t = 0) = \u2212 \u2211 j ( a\u2020jaj+1 + a \u2020 j+1aj + e \u2212i\u03b8ajaj+1 + e i\u03b8a\u2020j+1a \u2020 j ) + \u2211 j a\u2020,bj a b j , (255)\nand this is a model with winding number 1. We conclude this section by proving that the ground state of the Hamiltonian is given by fMPS (245)- (247). Let |0\u3009\u03b8,t be a vacuum state of aaj (\u03b8, t) and abj(\u03b8, t) i.e. aaj (\u03b8, t) |0\u3009\u03b8,t = 0 and abj(\u03b8, t) |0\u3009\u03b8,t = 0. Then, fermionic MPS representation of the ground state |GS(\u03b8, t)\u3009 is given by\n|GS(\u03b8, t)\u3009 = \u2211\ntr(\u2126Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL)(aa,\u2020(\u03b8, t)1)i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (aa,\u2020(\u03b8, t)L)iL |0\u3009\u03b8,t , (256)\nwhere A0 = 12 and A 1 = i\u03c32. Here, \u2126 is a boundary operator. Remark that since the transformation (253) is invertible, the vacuum |0\u3009\u03b8,t for aaj (\u03b8, t) and abj(\u03b8, t) is equal to the vacuum |0\u3009 for aaj and aaj i.e. |0\u3009\u03b8,t = |0\u3009. Now, substituting a\u0303(\u03b8, t) of the equation (253) for site 1 in equation (256), we get\n|GS(\u03b8, t)\u3009 = \u2211\ntr(\u2126A0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL)(aa,\u20202 (\u03b8, t))i2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (a a,\u2020 L (\u03b8, t)) iL |0\u3009 (257)\n+ \u2211\ntr(\u2126A1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL){cos (\u03b8 2 ) + i sin ( \u03b8 2 ) cos (t)}aa,\u20201 \u00b7 (a a,\u2020 2 (\u03b8, t)) i2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (aa,\u2020L (\u03b8, t)) iL |0\u3009 (258)\n+ \u2211\ntr(\u2126A1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL)i sin (\u03b8 2 ) sin (t)ab,\u20201 \u00b7 (a a,\u2020 2 (\u03b8, t)) i2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (aa,\u2020L (\u03b8, t)) iL |0\u3009 (259)\n= \u2211\ntr(\u2126Ai1,j1(\u03b8, t)Ai2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL)(aj1,\u20201 )i1(a a,\u2020 2 (\u03b8, t)) i2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (aa,\u2020L (\u03b8, t)) iL |0\u3009 , (260)\nwhere {Ai(\u03b8, t)}i=0,(1,a),(1,b) is defined by (245)-(247). By applying this operation to all sites, we see that the ground state of H(\u03b8, t) is given by fMPS (245)-(247).\nVII. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\nA. Summary\nWe used the fermionic MPS to study the space of 1+1-dimensional interacting SRE statesM. In particular, using this, we study the generalized Thouless pump in the non-trivial phase in interacting systems, which has not been investigated before. As a result, for approximations with matrix sizes up to 4\u00d7 4, we obtained the topology of the space of SRE states M in several cases, and revealed the existence of non-trivial Thouless\n43\npumps classified by Z or Z/2Z. As a special case, this result includes the pumping of the fermion parity in the Kitaev chain[10], which was already known in the free fermion system, in a manner consistent with previous studies[9, 11], and this study shows that this pump is stable in the presence of the interaction.\nIn addition, we used MPS to construct invariants of the pump in the trivial and non-trivial phases. This invariant also works in models with interactions, and we used this invariant to construct new models of the fermion parity pump: Kitaev\u2019s cononical pump model, the Gu-Wen model, a domain-wall counting model, the interacting Kitaev chain. We also showed that this invariant is related to the characteristic class of Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra bundles that have been studied mathematically in the context of a twist of K-theory [40].\nB. Discussion and Future Direction\nIn this paper, we studied the pumping phenomenon in the trivial and non-trivial phases of the SRE state using MPS. The fundamental and important problem is to generalize our approach to a more general symmetry.\nIt is also an interesting problem to investigate the classification of pumps parameterized by a more general X. This is a difficult problem in general, but mathematically there are several known results for the classification of Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra bundles[40]: let X be a parameter space. Then the graded Brauer group over X is defined by\nGBrU(X) := {isomorphic class of a Z/2Z-graded central simple C-algebra bundle over X }/ \u223c, (261)\nwhere [A] \u223c [B] if and only if there are vector space E0, E1, F0, F1 such that A \u2297 End(E0 \u2295 E1) ' B \u2297 End(F0 \u2295 F1). GBrU(X) has a group structure under the graded tensor product, and the isomorphism\nGBrC(X) ' H0 (X;Z/2Z)\u00d7H1 (X;Z/2Z)\u00d7H3 (X;Z)tor. . (262)\nis known as a group. Here, H3 (X;Z)tor. is the torsion subgroup of H3 (X;Z) and the group structure of the right-hand side is defined by\n(l, a, b) + (l\u2032, a\u2032, b\u2032) = (l + l\u2032, a+ a\u2032, b+ b\u2032 + \u03b2(a \u222a a\u2032)) (263)\nusing the Bockstein map \u03b2 : H2 (X;Z/2Z)\u2192 H3 (X;Z) We do not know whether the equivalence relation in the definition Eq.(261) is appropriate from the perspective of pump classification. However, the E2-page of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) of the Anderson dual of spin bordism group (I\u2126Spin)\nn+2(X), a candidate for the group that gives the classification of n+ 1-dimensional SRE states (predicted by field theory [45],[46]), is given by\nEp,q2 = H p (X; (I\u2126Spin) q)\u21d2 (I\u2126Spin)p+q(X)\n0 1 2 3\n0\n1\n2\n3 Z/2Z\nZ/2Z H1 (X;Z/2Z)\n0 0 0\nZ H1 (X;Z) H2 (X;Z) H3 (X;Z)\nand the right-hand side of Eq.(262) is a subset of a line corresponding to (I\u2126Spin) 3(X) (i.e., a line with p + q = 3). In this sense, we expect to be able to construct some non-trivial pumping models by using GBrC(X).\n44\nSimilarly, for\nGBrO(X) := {isomorphic class of a Z/2Z-graded central simple R-algebra bundle over X }/ \u223c, (264)\nit is known that there is an isomorphism of a group\nGBrO(X) ' H0 (X;Z/8Z)\u00d7H1 (X;Z/2Z)\u00d7H2 (X;Z/2Z) . (265)\nwhere the group structure of the right-hand side is defined by\n(l, a, b) + (l\u2032, a\u2032, b\u2032) = (l + l\u2032, a+ a\u2032, b+ b\u2032 + a \u222a a\u2032). (266)\nPhysically, Z/2Z-graded central simple R-algebra describes a 1 + 1-dimensional SRE state with time-reversal symmetry, so GBrO(X) is expected to be related to the Anderson dual of pin bordism group. In fact, the right-hand side of Eq. (265) is the same as a line corresponding to (I\u2126Pin\u2212)\n3(X) (i.e., a line with p+ q = 3) in the E2-page of the AHSS of coefficients (I\u2126Pin\u2212) 3(pt):\nEp,q2 = H p (X; (I\u2126Pin\u2212) q)\u21d2 (I\u2126Pin\u2212)p+q(X)\n0 1 2\n0\n1\n2 Z/2Z\nZ/2Z H1 (X;Z/2Z)\nZ H1 (X;Z) H2 (X;Z)\nActually, the isomorphism\nGBrR(X) ' (I\u2126Pin\u2212)3(X) (267)\nas a group has been mathematically proven in [47]. Therefore, we expect that the invariant of pumps can be defined by a similar construction for the interacting fermionic SRE state with time-reversal symmetry.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nS.O. acknowledge helpful discussions with R.

Central Simple Algebras over k\nLet k be the field. First, we give the definition of a central simple algebra over k.\nDefinition 9. Let A be the algebra over k. (1) A is simple if and only if there are not non-trivial both-side ideals. (2) A is central if and only if the center Z(A) of the algebra A is isomorphic to k.\nAn algebra which is simple and central is called a central simple algebra. For example, the matrix algebra Mn(R) is central simple as an algebra over R, and C is not central simple algebra over R because the center of C is C itself and not isomorphic to R. There are two different characterizations of central simple algebras.\nTheorem 7. (Wedderburn) Let A be an algebra over k, dim(A) = n <\u221e and A 6= 0. Then following conditions are equivalent: (1) A is central simple. (2) There exist the a division algebra D over k and m \u2208 N such that\nA ' Mm(D). (A1)\n(3) The map\nA\u2297k Aop \u2192 End(A) ' Mn2(k) (A2)\ngives an isomorphism, where Aop is the opposite algebra of A, that is, Aop is the algebra that is the same as A as a set but whose product \u25e6 is defined by a \u25e6 b = b \u00b7 a.\nThe tensor product of two central simple algebras is again central simple. Therefore, it is expected that the set of all central simple algebras MCSA has a group structure with respect to the tensor product. However, this does not make it a group, so the following equivalence relation is introduced.\nDefinition 10. Let A and B are central simple algebras. They are the Brauer equivalence if and only if there exist integers p, q \u2208 N such that\nA\u2297k Mp(k) ' B \u2297k Mq(k). (A3)\nWe denote A \u223c B when A and B are the Brauer equivalence.\nThen, we can define the Brauer group as follows:\nDefinition 11. Let MCSA be the set of all central simple algebras and \u223c be the Brauer equivalence. The Brauer group is the abelian group defined by\nBr(k) = MCSA/ \u223c (A4)\nwith the unit [k] and inverse [A]\u22121 = [Aop].\nOne way of understanding the Brauer group is to consider it as a group that classifies division algebras. In fact, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the Brauer group and the set of equivalence classes of the division algebra.\nFor example, it is known that Br(C) ' 0. Therefore the only division algebra over C is C itself, and the algebra A is central simple over C if and only if there exist m \u2208 N such that A ' Mm(C). 18 For another example, it is known that Br(R) ' Z/2Z ' {[R], [H]}. In fact, H \u2297 H is known to be isomorphic to M4(R), indicating that [H]2 = [R].\n18 In addition, it is known that if an algebra over C is simple, then it is central simple.\n46\n2. Z/2Z-graded Central Simple Algebras over k\nThe theory of central simple algebras and Brauer groups is known to be extended to the Z/2Z-graded algebra [36]. We will first define a Z/2Z-graded algebra.\nDefinition 12. An algebra A is Z/2Z-graded if and only if there exists a direct product decomposition\nA ' A(0) \u2295A(1) (A5)\nsuch that A(i) \u00b7 A(j) \u2282 A(i+j) for i, j \u2208 {0, 1}.\nSimplicity and centrality for Z/2Z-graded algebras are extended as follows.\nDefinition 13. Let A be a Z/2Z-graded algebra over k. (1) A is simple if and only if there are no Z/2Z-graded non-trivial both-side ideals. (2) A is central if and only if the even part of the center Z(A) \u2229 A(0) is isomorphic to k.\nAn Z/2Z-graded algebra which is simple and central is called a Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra. For example, let A be the Z/2Z-graded algebra over C generated by matrices\nA0 = ( 1 0 0 1 ) , A1 = ( 0 \u22121 1 0 ) (A6)\nwith Z/2Z-grading 0 and 1 respectively. This algebra is neither simple nor central as an ungraded algebra. In fact, this algebra has non-trivial ideals19\nI\u00b1 = ( A0 \u00b1 iA1 ) , (A7)\nand since A is a commutative algebra, the center Z(A) is isomorphic to A itself and not to C. However, this algebra is simple and central as Z/2Z-graded algebra. In fact, the only non-trivial ideals of A are the ideals of Eq.(A7), these are not Z/2Z-graded, and the even part of the center Z(A) \u2229 A(0) is isomorphic to C.\nAs we observed above, an algebra that is not central or simple as an ungraded algebra may be central or simple as a Z/2Z-graded algebra. Given a Z/2Z-graded algebra, the pattern of breaking centrality and simplicity as an ungraded algebra is classified by the following structure theorem [36].\nTheorem 8. Let A be the Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra. Then either one of the following is satisfied. (1) A is central simple as an ungraded algebra, there exists u \u2208 A(0) such that u2 = a \u00b7 1 for some a \u2208 k, and the center Z(A(0)) is isomorphic to Span(1, u). (2) A(0) is central simple as an ungraded algebra, there exists u \u2208 A(1) such that u2 = a \u00b7 1 for some a \u2208 k, and the center Z(A) is isomorphic to Span(1, u).\nIn Wall\u2019s paper, the case (1) is called (+), and the case (2) is called (\u2212). It is possible to define the analogue of the Brauer group for Z/2Z-graded algebra , it is called graded Brauer group or Brauer-Wall group denoted by BW(k). The Brauer-Wall group can be regarded as a group that classifies three sets of data: (+) or (\u2212), a \u2208 k, and division algebra D such that if A is a (+)-algebra, A ' Matn(D) and if A is a (\u2212)-algebra, A(0) ' Matn(D). For example, BW(C) ' Z/2Z and BW(R) ' Z/8Z, which is known as the complex and real Bott periodicity.\n19 Here (a) denotes the both-sides ideal generated by a \u2208 A.\n47\nAppendix B: A Proof of the Theorem 3 for PBC\nFor a Wall matrix u of {Ai}i, the set of matrices {uAi}i is also injective fMPS with the Wall invariant (+) in the canonical form 20. Let us consider the wave functions of the bosonic MPS |{uAi}i\u3009L for odd length L,\ntr[(uAi1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (uAiL)] = (\u22121) \u2211(L\u22121)/2 k=1 |i2k|tr[uAi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL ]. (B1)\nSince the overall sign (\u22121) \u2211(L\u22121)/2 k=1 |i2k| does not depend on {Ai}i or u, the gauge equivalence {Ai}i \u223cPBC {A\u0303i}i implies that the equivalence of two injective bosonic MPSs |{uAi}i\u3009 = ei\u03b1L |{u\u0303A\u0303i}i\u3009 for any odd L. From Theorem 1, there exists a unique U(1) phase ei\u03b2 and U(2n) matrix V such that\nu\u0303A\u0303i = ei\u03b2V \u2020uAiV (B2)\nholds. Here, V is unique up to U(1) phase. It can also be written as\nu\u0303A\u0303i = ei\u03b2(uV u\u0303)\u2020uAi(uV u\u0303). (B3)\nFrom the uniqueness of V , uV u\u0303 = ei\u03c6V , and u2 = u\u03032 = 1 gives us u\u0303 = \u00b1V \u2020uV .\nAppendix C: A Proof of Lemma 1\nBefore going into the proof of Lemma 1, we prove two lemmas.\nLemma 2. Let {Bi}i=1,...,N be a set of n\u00d7 n matrices. For L \u2208 N, we introduce\n\u0393eL(X) := \u2211\n{ik | \u2211 k|ik|\u22610} tr(XBi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL) |i1, ..., iL\u3009 (C1)\nand\n\u0393oL(X) := \u2211\n{ik | \u2211 k|ik|\u22611} tr(XBi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL) |i1, ..., iL\u3009 . (C2)\nThen {Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL | \u2211 k |ik| \u2261 0} ({Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL | \u2211 k |ik| \u2261 1}, resp.) span the matrix algebra Mn(C) as vector space if and only if (\u0393eL) (\u0393 o L, resp.) is injective.\nProof. (\u21d2):Let X be a n\u00d7 n matrix such that \u0393eL(X) = 0. Then\ntr(XBi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL) = 0 (C3) for any (i1, ..., iL) with \u2211 k |ik| \u2261 0. Since {Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL | \u2211 k |ik| \u2261 0} span the matrix algebra Mn(C), there are ck,li1,...,iL \u2208 C \u00d7 such that ek,l = \u2211 {ik | \u2211 k|ik|\u22610} ck,li1,...,iLB i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL for any k, l \u2208 {1, ..., n}. Here ek,l is a matrix in which only the (k, l) component is 1 and the others are 0. By taking a linear combination of Eq.(C3) with weight ck,li1,...,iL , we obtain 0 = tr(Xek,l) = Xl,k and thus X = 0. Therefore \u0393 e L is injective. In the same way, we can also show the injectivity of \u0393oL. (\u21d0) : Note that \u0393eL : Cn 2 \u2192 CNL. Taking {ek,l} and {|i1, ..., iL\u3009 | \u2211L k=1 |ik| \u2261 0} as the basis of Cn 2\nand CNL, the matrix representation of \u0393eL is\n(\u0393eL)(i1,...,iL),(k,l) = (B i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL)l,k. (C4)\n20 The products generated by the matrices {uAi}i are written as uAi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7uAil \u221d (u) 1\u2212(\u22121)l\n2 Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail . Thus, if the set {Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Ail} spans M2n(C), so is {(uAi1 ) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (uAil )}.\n48\nThe (i1, . . . , iL)th row vector is identified with the matrix B i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL . Since the matrix rank of \u0393eL is n2 from the injectivity of \u0393eL, {Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL | \u2211 k |ik| \u2261 0} is a basis of the n\u00d7 n matrix algebra Mn(C). The odd case can be proved in the same way.\nLemma 3. For L \u2208 N, suppose that both {Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL | \u2211 k |ik| \u2261 0} and {Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL | \u2211 k |ik| \u2261 1} span the matrix algebra Mn(C) as vector space. Then the same is true for L+ 1.\nProof. By Lemma 2, it is sufficient to show that \u0393eL+1 and \u0393 o L+1 are injective. Let X be a n\u00d7 n matrix such that \u0393eL+1(X) = 0. Then\n\u0393eL+1(X) = 0\u21d4 \u2211\niL+1,|iL+1|=0\n\u0393eL(B iL+1X) |iL+1\u3009+ \u2211 iL+1,|iL+1|=1 \u0393oL(B iL+1X) |iL+1\u3009 = 0\n\u21d4\n{ \u0393eL(B\niL+1X) = 0, (|iL+1| = 0) \u0393oL(B iL+1X) = 0, (|iL+1| = 1)\n\u21d4 BiL+1X = 0 (any iL+1). (C5)\nSince {Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL | \u2211 k |ik| \u2261 0} span the matrix algebra Mn(C), there are cei1,...,iL \u2208 C\n\u00d7 such that 1 =\u2211 {ik | \u2211 k|ik|\u22610} cei1,...,iLB i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL . By taking a linear combination of Eq.(C5) with weight ck,li1,...,iL , we obtain\nX = \u2211 {ik | \u2211 k|ik|\u22610} cei1,...,iLB i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiLX = 0 and thus X = 0. Therefore \u0393eL+1 is injective. In the same way, we can also show the injectivity of \u0393oL+1.\nWe also provide a type of the fundamental theorem for bosonic injective MPS matrices not in the canonical form:\nLemma 4. Let {Ai} and {A\u0303i} be injective n\u00d7 n MPSs. The followings are equivalent.\n(i) They give the same states for any even system sizes, i.e. for any L \u2208 2N there exists a U(1) phase ei\u03b1L such that |{Ai}\u3009L = ei\u03b1L |{A\u0303i}\u3009L holds.\n(ii) There exist an invertible matrix M and a U(1) phase z \u2208 U(1) satisfying Ai = zM\u22121A\u0303iM .\nHere, z is unique and M is unique up to C\u00d7. This statement holds when L rums over odd integers L \u2208 2N+1.\nProof. To make injective MPS matrices into the canonical form, we can use the following procedure: Let E(X) = \u2211 iA iXAi\u2020 and E\u0303(X) = \u2211 i A\u0303\niXA\u0303i\u2020 be the transfer matrices and \u03c1, \u03c1\u0303 \u2208 R>0 be its spectral radius. It is known that if \u039b is an eigenmatrix of E with eigenvalue \u03c1, \u039b is unique up to C\u00d7 and positive definite [24]. It is also known that if \u039b\u2032 is an eigenmatrix of E with eigenvalue \u03bb and |\u03bb| = \u03c1, then \u039b\u2032 = \u039b and \u03bb = \u03c1[28]. Therefore if we define A\u2032i = 1\n\u03c1 1 2\n\u039b\u2212 1 2Ai\u039b 1 2 , then \u2211 iA \u2032iA\u2032i\u2020 = 1\u03c1 \u2211 iX \u2212 12Ai\u039b 1 2 (\u039b\u2212 1 2Ai\u039b 1 2 )\u2020 = \u039b\u2212 1 2XX 1 2 = 1,\nso the canonical form. Let \u039b and \u039b\u0303 be the positive definite eigenmatrix of E and E\u0303 . Assume that \u03c1 = \u03c1\u0303. Then, since |{Ai}\u3009L = ei\u03b1L |{A\u0303i}\u3009L,\ntr(Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL) = ei\u03b1Ltr(A\u0303i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A\u0303iL)\u21d4 tr(A\u2032i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7A\u2032iL) = ei\u03b1Ltr(A\u0303\u2032i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 A\u0303\u2032iL). (C6)\nBy using the fundamental theorem for bosonic MPS in the canonical form (Theorem 1), there is a unitary matrix U and a unique U(1) phase z such that\nA\u2032i = zUA\u0303\u2032iU\u2020 \u21d4 Ai = z(\u039b 12U \u039b\u0303\u2212 12 )A\u0303i(\u039b 12U \u039b\u0303\u2212 12 )\u22121, (C7)\nand \u039b 1 2U \u039b\u0303\u2212 1 2 is unique up to C\u00d7.\n49\nFinally we show that \u03c1 = \u03c1\u0303. The norm of an MPS is given by \u3008{Ai}|{Ai}\u3009 = \u2211 {ik}} tr(Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL)tr(Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL)\u2217\n= \u2211 {ik} \u2211 k,l \u3008k|Ai1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL |k\u3009 \u3008l|Ai1\u2020 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL\u2020 |l\u3009\n= \u2211 k,l \u3008k| EL(\u3008k| |l\u3009) |l\u3009\n= tr(EL). (C8)\nSince |{Ai}\u3009L = ei\u03b1L |{A\u0303i}\u3009L, for sufficiently large even integer L,\n\u3008{Ai}|{Ai}\u3009 = \u3008{A\u0303i}|{A\u0303i}\u3009 \u21d4 tr(EL) = tr(E\u0303L) (C9) \u21d4 \u03c1L(1 + \u2211 i ( \u03c1i \u03c1 )L) = \u03c1\u0303L(1 + \u2211 i ( \u03c1\u0303i \u03c1\u0303 )L), (C10)\nwhere \u03c1 > \u03c11 \u2265 \u03c12 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 and \u03c1\u0303 > \u03c1\u03031 \u2265 \u03c1\u03032 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 are eigenvalues of E and E\u0303 . Therefore, if we take the limit of large L, we obtain \u03c1 = \u03c1\u0303. It is obvious that this is true if instead of the condition that L is even, we change it to odd.\nProof of Lemma 1. First, introduce some notations. We denote products of matrices Bis by\nBI (L) := Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL for I(L) = (i1, . . . , iL). (C11)\nWe denote the even and odd sets of L labels of is as\nIeL = {(i1, . . . , iL)| L\u2211 k=1 |ik| \u2261 0}, (C12)\nIoL = {(i1, . . . , iL)| L\u2211 k=1 |ik| \u2261 1}, (C13)\nrespectively. By using these notations, the injectivity of {\u03c3|i|x \u2297 Bi} is that both the sets of matrices {BI(l) |I(l) \u2208 Iel } and {BI (l) |I(l) \u2208 Iol } span Mn(C) for some l \u2208 N. Both the sets of matrices {BI (L)}I(L)\u2208IeL and {BI(L)}I(L)\u2208IoL can also regarded as injective MPS with the length l = 1, but not in the canonical form because \u2211 I(L)\u2208Ie/oL BI (L) (BI (L) )\u2020 = 1n does not holds in general. The same is true for the set of matrices {B\u0303i}i. In the following, we denote l as the smallest integer such that all the sets of matrices {BI(l) |I(l) \u2208 Iel }, {BI(l) |I(l) \u2208 Iol }, {B\u0303I (l) |I(l) \u2208 Iel }, and {B\u0303I\n(l) |I(l) \u2208 Iol } span Mn(C). We introduce weight vectors ce I(l) , co I(l) , c\u0303e I(l) and c\u0303o I(l)\nso that\u2211 I(l)\u2208Iel ceI(l)B I(l) = \u2211 I(l)\u2208Iol coI(l)B I(l) = \u2211 I(l)\u2208Iel c\u0303eI(l)B\u0303 I(l) = \u2211 I(l)\u2208Iol c\u0303oI(l)B\u0303 I(l) = 1n (C14)\nis satisfied. We give a proof of Lemma 1 for APBC and PBC separately.\nThe case of APBC\u2014 Suppose {\u03c3|i|x \u2297Bi}i \u223c {\u03c3|i|x \u2297Bi}i. This is equivalent to say that for any L \u2208 N there exists e\u03b1L \u2208 U(1) such that\ntr[Bi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7BiL ] = ei\u03b1Ltr[B\u0303i1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 B\u0303iL ] for all (i1, . . . , iL) \u2208 IeL.

Applying the above argument to the MPS {BI(2l)}I(2l)\u2208Ie2l of length 2l, there are a unique z (2l) e \u2208 U(1) and a matrix x(2l)e \u2208 GLn(C) such that\nB\u0303I (l) B\u0303J (l)\n= z(2l)e (x (2l) e )\n\u22121BI (l) BJ (l)\nx(2l)e (C23)\nfor |I(l)|+ |J (l)| \u2261 0.

(C25)\n51\nSince the set of matrices {Bi}i is injective in the bosonic sense and in the canonical form, 1n is the only eigenmatrix of the eigenvalue 1 of the transfer matrix EB(X) = \u2211 iB iXBi\u2020. Therefore, x (l+1) e (x (l+1) e )\u2020 = \u03bb1n with \u03bb \u2208 C\u00d7. Normalizing x(l+1)e to x(l+1)e (x(l+1)e )\u2020 = 1n, we conclude that x(l+1)e is unitary and unique up to U(1) phase.\nThe case of PBC\u2014 Suppose {\u03c3|i|x \u2297 Bi}i \u223cPBC {\u03c3|i|x \u2297 Bi}i.

First of all, we prove the following lemma.\nLemma 5. Let A0 = 14, and let A be the Z/2Z-graded algebra generated by A0 and A1. In this case, the structure of A is given by\nA ' C [t] / (f) (D1)\nas a Z/2Z-graded algebra. Here, the right-hand side is regarded as a Z/2Z-graded algebra with the degree of t being 1, and ' means an isomorphism, and f be the minimal polynomial of A1, and (f) denote the two-sided ideals generated by f .\nProof. Let p : C [t]\u2192 A be the map t 7\u2192 A1. All we have to do is show ker (p) ' (f).\n\u2022 (f) \u2282 ker (p) : This is obvious.\n\u2022 ker (p) \u2282 (f) : For any g \u2208 ker(p), g(A1) = 0 by definition. Since f is the minimal polynomial, f divides g, so g \u2208 (f), i.e. ker(g) \u2282 (f).\nTherefore, ker (p) ' (f) and from the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms theorem,\nA ' C [t] / (f) (D2)\nas a Z/2Z-graded algebra.\nFrom the lemma 5, we need to find the minimal polynomial f of A1. Since the degree of A1 is odd, f has degree 2 at least. Since\n(A1)2 =\n( (A\u03031)2 0\n0 (A\u03031)2\n) , (D3)\ndenoting eigenvalues of ( A1 )2 by \u03b1 and \u03b2, then\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 \u21d2 f(t) = (t2 \u2212 \u03b1)(t2 \u2212 \u03b2) (D4) \u03b1 6= \u03b2 \u21d2 f(t) = (t2 \u2212 \u03b1). (D5)\nTherefore, the structure of the algebra A is determined as follows.\n53\nProposition 1. Let \u03b1 and \u03b2 be the eigenvalues of \u2212(A\u03031)2. Then the following holds.\nA '\n{ C [t] / (t2 \u2212 \u03b1)(t2 \u2212 \u03b2) (\u03b1 = \u03b2)\nC [t] / (t2 \u2212 \u03b1) (\u03b1 6= \u03b2) (D6)\nwhere t has a degree 1 and ' means isomorphism as Z/2Z-graded algebra.\nTherefore, the structure of the ideals in A can be classified as follows:\n\u2022 The case of \u03b1 6= \u03b2. Using Chinese remainder theorem, we can decompose A into\nC [t] / (t2 \u2212 \u03b1)(t2 \u2212 \u03b2) ' C [t] / (t2 \u2212 \u03b1)\u00d7 C [t] / (t2 \u2212 \u03b2). (D7)\nThus A is not simple since each component is a subalgebra of A.\n\u2022 The case of \u03b1 = \u03b2. When \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0, since A has a non trivial ideal (t), A is not simple. When \u03b1 = \u03b2 6= 0, (t\u2212 \u03b1) is a ideal of A but not Z/2Z-graded algebra. Therefore, in this case, A is central simple as a Z/2Z-graded algebra.\nThe above shows that when A0 = 14, the necessary and sufficient condition for A to be a Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra is\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 6= 0 (D8)\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are eigenvalues of (A\u03031)2. Next, we denote\nA\u03031 = ( a b c d ) (D9)\nand rewrite this condition for components a, b, c and d. Since the square of A\u03031 is\n(A\u03031)2 = ( a2 + bc ab+ bd ac+ dc bc+ d2 ) , (D10)\nthe eigenvalue of \u2212(A\u03031)2 is\ndet ( \u03bb\u2212 (A\u03031)2 ) = 0\u21d4 \u03bb = (a2 + d2 + 2bc)\u00b1 \u221a\n(a+ d)2{(a\u2212 d)2 + 4bc} 2 . (D11)\nTherefore, eq.(D8) can be rewritten as\neq.(D8)\u21d4  (a+ d)2{(a\u2212 d)2 + 4bc} = 0 and\na2 + d2 + 2bc 6= 0 (D12)\nin terms of components. In particular, we rewrite the first condition as follows.\n\u2022 In the case of a+ d = 0 (\u21d4 trA\u03031 = 0):\na2 + d2 + 2bc 6= 0\u21d4 (a+ d)2 \u2212 2(ad\u2212 bc) 6= 0\u21d4 det(A\u03031) 6= 0 (D13)\n\u2022 In the case of (a\u2212 d)2 + 4bc = 0 (\u21d4 (a+ d)2 \u2212 4(ad\u2212 bc) = 0\u21d4 tr(A\u03031)2 \u2212 4 det(A\u03031) = 0):\na2 + d2 + 2bc 6= 0\u21d4 tr(A\u03031)2 \u2212 2 det(A\u03031) 6= 0\u21d4 det(A\u03031) 6= 0 (D14)\n54\nFinally, we obtained the following formula.\neq.(D8)\u21d4 det(A\u03031) 6= 0 and  tr(A\u03031) = 0 or\ntr(A\u03031)2 \u2212 4 det(A\u03031) = 0 (D15)\nThis is the claim of Theorem 5.\nAppendix E: A Proof of Theorem 6\nIn this section, we prove Theorem 6 and determine the topology of the space of MPS when A0 = 14. As we saw in Appendix D, the necessary and sufficient conditions for A to be a Z/2Z-graded central simple algebra were given by (i) det(A\u03031) 6= 0, and tr(A\u03031) = 0 or (ii) det(A\u03031) 6= 0, and tr(A\u03031)2 \u2212 4 det(A\u03031) = 0. In the following, we determine the topology of the space represented by each of the cases (i) and (ii).\n\u2022 (i) det(A\u03031) 6= 0, tr(A\u03031) = 0 First, recall the polar decomposition theorem for complex matrices.\nTheorem 9. Let A \u2208 Mn(C) be a n\u00d7n matrix, then there exist a unitary matrix U \u2208 U(n) and positive-semidefinite Hermitian matrix P such that\nA = U \u00b7 P. (E1)\nIn particular, if A \u2208 GL(n;C), U and P are unique.\nApplying the polar decomposition theorem to A1, there is a unique unitary matrix U and positivesemidefinite Hermitian matrix P such that A1 = U \u00b7 P , since the determinant of A1 is not zero. In addition, since P is Hermitian, it can be diagonalized using the unitary matrix V :\nP = V \u00b7 \u039b \u00b7 V \u2020, \u039b = ( \u03bb1 0 0 \u03bb2 ) (E2)\nHere, from the semi-positivity of P , \u03bb1, \u03bb2 \u2208 R>0. Therefore, A\u03031 = U \u00b7 V \u00b7 \u039b \u00b7 V \u2020. Next, we calculate tr(A\u03031). First, from the cyclicity of trace,\ntr(A\u03031) = tr(U \u00b7 V \u00b7 \u039b \u00b7 V \u2020) = tr(V \u2020U \u00b7 V \u00b7 \u039b). (E3)\nAny 2\u00d7 2 unitary matrix W \u2208 U(2) can be written by W = ei\u03b8 ( a \u2212b\u2217 b a\u2217 ) (E4)\nwhere a, b \u2208 C satisfying |a|2 + |b|2 = 1 and \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). Therefore, we denote V \u2020UV \u2208 U(2) as\nV \u2020UV = ei\u03b8 ( a \u2212b\u2217 b a\u2217 ) (E5)\nfor some a, b and \u03b8 as described above, we can rewrite A\u03031 as\ntr(A\u03031) = ei\u03b8tr (( a \u2212b\u2217 b a\u2217 )( \u03bb1 0 0 \u03bb2 )) = ei\u03b8(a\u03bb1 + a \u2217\u03bb2). (E6)\nAccordingly, we obtained the following necessary and sufficient conditions:\ntr(A\u03031) = 0\u21d4 a\u03bb1 + a\u2217\u03bb2 = 0 (E7)\n55\n1. In the case of a 6= 0. In this case, \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 since \u03bb1 = \u2212a \u2217\na \u03bb2 and \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are positive real number. Therefore,\nA\u03031 = U \u00b7 V \u00b7 \u039b \u00b7 V \u2020 = \u03bbU, (\u03bb \u2208 R>0) (E8)\n2. In the case of a = 0. In this case, it is obvious that tr(A\u03031) = 0 for any \u03bb1 and \u03bb2. By substituting\nV \u2020UV \u039b = ei\u03b8 (\n0 \u2212b\u2217 b 0 )( \u03bb1 0 0 \u03bb2 ) (E9)\ninto A\u03031 = UV \u039bV \u2020 = V ( V \u2020UV \u039b ) V \u2020, we get\nA\u03031 = \u03bb1e i\u03b8V ( 0 \u2212b\u2217 b 0 )( 1 0 0 \u03bb2/\u03bb1 ) V \u2020. (E10)\nWe can use continuous deformation to make \u03bb2/\u03bb1 = 1 since \u03bb2/\u03bb1 > 0. Accordingly, we obtain\nA\u03031 = V \u2020UV \u039b = \u03bb1e i\u03b8V ( 0 \u2212b\u2217 b 0 ) V \u2020 (E11)\nand this comes down to the case of a 6= 0.\nAs a result, it was found that the range of A\u03031 is\n{\u03bbei\u03b8U |\u03bb > 0, U \u2208 U (2) , tr(U) = 0}, (E12)\nWe need, therefore, to find the topology of this space. Let U \u2208 U(2) be\nU = ( a \u2212b\u2217 b a\u2217 ) . (E13)\nSince tr(U) = 0, a = \u2212a\u2217 and therefore a is pure imaginary. We define x = \u2212ia \u2208 R and by using x2 + |b|2 = 1, we get\nU =  ix \u2212\u221a1\u2212 |x|2e\u2212i\u03d5\u221a 1\u2212 |x|2ei\u03d5 \u2212ix  (E14) = ( i cos(\u03c7) \u2212e\u2212i\u03d5 sin(\u03c7) ei\u03d5 sin(\u03c7) \u2212i cos(\u03c7) ) (E15)\nwhere \u03d5 is phase of b and x = cos (\u03c7). We can see that \u03c7, \u03c6 are the coordinates of S2 which is the equator of S3 \u223c SU (2). Note that \u03bb does not contribute to the homotopy of M, so the topology is S1 \u00d7 S2 Z/2Zdiag . Also, the case a = 0 can be deformed smoothly to the equator S2 by continuous deformation. The above shows that condition (i) det(A\u03031) 6= 0, tr(A\u03031) = 0 is homotopic to R>0 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 S2\nZ/2Zdiag .\n\u2022 (ii) det(A\u03031) 6= 0, tr(A\u03031)2 \u2212 4 det(A\u03031) = 0 By using polar decomposition theorem again, we get\ntr(A\u03031)2 \u2212 4 det(A\u03031) = 0\u21d4 tr(UV \u039bV \u2020)2 \u2212 4 det(UV \u039bV \u2020) = 0 (E16) \u21d4 tr(V \u2020UV \u039b)2 \u2212 4 det(V \u2020UV ) det(\u039b) = 0. (E17)\nSince V \u2020UV \u2208 U(2), this can be denoted\nV \u2020UV = ei\u03b8 ( a \u2212b\u2217 b a\u2217 ) , \u039b = ( \u03bb1\n\u03bb2\n) (E18)\n56\nusing \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) and a, b \u2208 C such that |a|2 + |b|2 = 1. By substituting this into eq.(E17), we get\ne2i\u03b8tr (( a \u2212b\u2217 b a\u2217 )( \u03bb1\n\u03bb2\n))2 \u2212 4e2i\u03b8\u03bb1\u03bb2 = 0 (E19)\n\u21d4 (a\u03bb1 + a\u2217\u03bb2)2 \u2212 4\u03bb1\u03bb2 = 0 (E20) \u21d4 a2\u03bb22 + 2 |a| 2 \u03bb1\u03bb2 + a \u22172\u03bb22 \u2212 4\u03bb1\u03bb2 = 0 (E21)\n\u21d4 a2 ( \u03bb2 \u03bb1 )2 + 2(|a|2 \u2212 2)\u03bb2 \u03bb1 + a\u22172 = 0. (E22)\nTherefore,\n\u03bb1 \u03bb2\n= \u2212 |a|2 + 2\u00b1\n\u221a 1\u2212 |a|2\na2 = 1 + |b|2 \u00b1 2 |b| a2 = (1\u00b1 |b|)2 a2 . (E23)\nIn particular, since a \u2208 R (due to \u03bb1\u03bb2 \u2208 R>0), we get\n(1\u00b1 |b|)2\na2 =\n(1\u00b1 |b|)2\n(1 + |b|)(1\u2212 |b|) = 1\u00b1 |b| 1\u2213 |b| . (E24)\nSuppose \u03bb1 \u2265 \u03bb2 without loss of generality,\n\u03bb1 \u03bb2 = 1 + |b| 1\u2212 |b| =: r (1 \u2264 r <\u221e). (E25)\nSubstituting this into eq.(E22),\n\u03bb2(ra+ a\u2217)2 \u2212 4\u03bb2r = 0 (E26)\nand simplify the above equation, paying attention to a = a\u2217, we get\na = \u00b12 \u221a r\n1 + r , |b| =\n\u221a 1\u2212 ( 2 \u221a r\n1 + r ) = r \u2212 1 1 + r . (E27)\nSubstituting this result into eq.(E18),\nV \u2020UV =  \u00b1 2 \u221a r 1 + r \u2212 r \u2212 1 1 + r e\u2212i\u03d5\nr \u2212 1 1 + r\nei\u03d5 \u00b1 2 \u221a r\n1 + r  (E28) and finally we get\nA\u03031 = UV \u039bV \u2020 = \u03bbei\u03b8V  \u00b1 2 \u221a r 1 + r \u2212 r \u2212 1 1 + r e\u2212i\u03d5\nr \u2212 1 1 + r\nei\u03d5 \u00b1 2 \u221a r\n1 + r\n(r 1 ) V \u2020. (E29)\nThe matrix part is homotopic to two 2-dimensional open disks D2open, and each of which contains \u00b11 ' Z/2Z \u2208 SU (2). The above shows that condition (ii) det(A\u03031) 6= 0, tr(A\u03031)2 \u2212 4 det(A\u03031) = 0 is homotopic to R>0 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 Z/2Z Z/2Zdiag .\n57\nAppendix F: The Berry Phase\nIn Sec.IV B, we construct a non-trivial path {a1 = \u03bbei\u03b8 | \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0]} in Mnon-trivialn=1,N=2 . In this section, let\u2019s compute the Berry phase of the ground state along this path. Although, in general, the Berry phase is not quantized, we claim that the ratio of them in periodic and anti-periodic systems is quantized for large system size limit and it is a candidate for invariant of the pump.\nThe fermionic MPSs with the Wall matrix u are given by |{Ai(\u03b8), u(\u03b8)}\u3009 = \u2211 {ik} tr ( uAi1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7AiL ) |i1, ...iL\u3009 (F1)\n= \u2211\n{ik},odd\n( \u03bbei\u03b8 )\u2211 k|ik| (\u22121) \u2211 {ik}|ik|+1 2 |i1, ...iL\u3009 (F2)\n= \u2211\n{ik},odd\ni ( i\u03bbei\u03b8 )\u2211 k|ik| |i1, ...iL\u3009 , (F3)\nwhere \u2211 {ik} means summing over all combinations of {i1, ...., iL}, and \u2211 {ik},odd means summing over all combinations whose sum is odd. Since the normalized ground state is given by\n|\u03a6(\u03b8)\u3009 := 1\u221a\n\u3008MPS|MPS\u3009 |MPS\u3009 (F4)\n= 1\u221a\u2211\n{ik},odd (\u03bb 2)\n\u2211 k|ik| \u2211 {ik},odd i ( i\u03bbei\u03b8 )\u2211 k|ik| |i1, ...iL\u3009 , (F5)\nthe Berry connection A (\u03b8) is\nA (\u03b8) = \u3008\u03a6(\u03b8)| \u2202 \u2202\u03b8 |\u03a6(\u03b8)\u3009 (F6)\n= 1\u2211\n{ik},odd (\u03bb 2)\n\u2211 k|ik| \u2211 {ik},odd ( i \u2211 k |ik| )( \u03bb2 )\u2211 k|ik| (F7)\n= \u03bb2\u2211\n{ik},odd (\u03bb 2)\n\u2211 k|ik|  d d\u03bb2 \u2211 {ik},odd (\u03bb2) \u2211 k|ik|  (F8) = L \u00b7 ( 1\u2212 ( 1 + \u03bb2\n)L\u22121 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb2)L\u22121 (1 + \u03bb2) L \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb2)L ) . (F9)\nNote that we used the identity\n\u2211 {ik},odd ( \u03bb2 )\u2211 k|ik| =\n( 1 + \u03bb2 )L \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb2)L 2\n(F10)\nin the last line. Since the phase of the state differs by a factor of \u22121 between \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0, the Berry phase in periodic systems i\u03b7P , including this contribution, is\nei\u03b7P = exp(iL\u03c0 \u00b7 ( 1\u2212 ( 1 + \u03bb2 )L\u22121 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb2)L\u22121 (1 + \u03bb2) L \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb2)L ) + i\u03c0), (F11)\n= exp(\u2212iL\u03c0 \u00b7 ( 1 + \u03bb2 )L\u22121 \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb2)L\u22121 (1 + \u03bb2) L \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb2)L + i (L+ 1)\u03c0). (F12)\n58\nSimilarly, we can compute the Berry phase in anti-periodic system\nei\u03b7AP = exp(iL\u03c0 \u00b7 ( 1\u2212 ( 1 + \u03bb2 )L\u22121 + ( 1\u2212 \u03bb2 )L\u22121 (1 + \u03bb2) L + (1\u2212 \u03bb2)L ) ), (F13)\n= exp(\u2212iL\u03c0 \u00b7 ( 1 + \u03bb2 )L\u22121 + ( 1\u2212 \u03bb2 )L\u22121 (1 + \u03bb2) L + (1\u2212 \u03bb2)L + iL\u03c0). (F14)\nNote that since |{Ai(\u03b8), 12}\u3009 is 2\u03c0-periodic, there is not additional phase i\u03c0. The difference of \u03b7s is\ni\u03b7P \u2212 i\u03b7AP = i\u03c0 + i 4\u03c0L\u03bb2(1 + \u03bb2)(1\u2212 \u03bb2) (1 + \u03bb2)2L \u2212 (1\u2212 \u03bb2)2L\n(F15)\nand since the second term converges to zero as L to \u221e, the ratio\nei\u03b7P\nei\u03b7AP (F16)\nexponentially converges to \u22121.\n[1] Z.-C.
