 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the background paper:

1. Further explore the cholinesterase inhibitory potential of other extracts and fractions of Myrtus communis, such as hexane, ethyl acetate, etc. The paper only looked at methyl alcohol extracts. Other extracts may have different phytochemical profiles and anti-cholinesterase activities. 

2. Isolate and identify the specific phytocompounds from Myrtus communis that exhibit the strongest anti-cholinesterase effects. Then test the isolated compounds in vitro and in vivo to validate their inhibitory potential. This could lead to discovery of novel cholinesterase inhibitors.

3. Modify the chemical structures of the potent Myrtus communis phytocompounds to improve potency, reduce toxicity, and optimize drug-like properties. For example, adding sulfonate or sulfamate groups as suggested. Medicinal chemistry efforts could yield improved lead compounds.

4. Evaluate combinations or synergistic blends of the Myrtus communis phytocompounds for anti-cholinesterase effects. Certain combinations may exhibit synergism and be more potent than single compounds.

5. Assess the anticholinesterase phytocompounds from Myrtus communis in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. This could provide in vivo evidence of their ability to improve cognitive function and memory. Active compounds could then advance to human clinical trials.
