Extension to Other Sports and Activities: The methodology and model proposed can be extended and adapted to other sports or physical activities requiring detailed action analysis. Exploring the model's applicability and efficiency in recognizing and analyzing complex movements in sports like basketball, football, or dance could provide insights into universal and sport-specific movement patterns and training improvements.

Integration with Real-Time Feedback Systems: Developing a real-time HAR system that integrates the proposed model to provide immediate feedback to athletes during training sessions. This could involve wearable technology or smart environments that analyze actions as they occur, offering instant feedback on performance, error correction, and personalized training adjustments.

Cross-Channel Information Analysis: Addressing the identified limitation of lacking a coordinated attention structure to capture cross-channel information, research could focus on developing a multi-modal HAR system that combines skeletal data with other data types (e.g., video, inertial sensors) for a more comprehensive analysis of human actions. This could enhance the model's accuracy and applicability in complex, real-world environments.

Longitudinal Training Improvement Analysis: Utilizing the model for longitudinal studies to track and analyze athletes' performance over time. By monitoring the evolution of movement patterns, coaches and researchers could better understand how technical skills develop, identify potential for injury based on incorrect techniques, and customize training programs for optimal performance enhancement.

Automated Technique Error Identification and Correction Recommendations: Building upon the model's ability to identify technical errors in tennis strokes, future research could aim to automate the generation of corrective recommendations. This would involve developing a knowledge base of common errors and corresponding corrective actions, enabling the system not only to identify mistakes but also to suggest specific drills or adjustments to improve technique.
