    "abstractText": "Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic brought enormous challenges for health professionals. As in past epidemics, the uncertainty, danger and fear of contamination and an excessive load of work under dramatic conditions may contribute to aggravate the mental health of health professionals. Objectives: Explore how the Covid-19 crisis impacted the mental health of healthcare workers and how their mental status relates with perspectives on the recent past and near future. Methods:A longitudinal study will be applied in two phases, Q1 and Q2, one year apart, to evaluate depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress among health professionals from a healthcare center in Portugal. Phase Q1 is concluded and comprised the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale \u2013 Revised (IES-R) and a questionnaire about the past and the future. Results: The IES-R scale revealed that nurses are at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than other professionals. The levels of depression and anxiety in the DASS-21 show no significant differences. Interestingly, professionals who worked almost exclusively at inpatient wards show higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress than those who worked at several hospital units (emergency, inpatient and outpatient units). A positive correlation was found between depression and anxiety and negative perspectives about the past and the future. Conclusions: Covid-19 posed a terrible challenge for health professionals. Its impact on the mental health of healthcare workers may be significant even after the pandemic is under control.",

Objectives:Objectify anxiety in frontline medical and paramedical staff and study its associated factors. Methods: We conducted a national descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study via a survey over a 2-month period from September to October 2020. We used \u201cBeck Anxiety Inventory\u201d to screen anxiety as well as \u201cBrief Cope Scale\u201d to detect probable correlations between anxiety and coping mechanisms. Results: We collected 78 persons. The mean age was 29.86 years. 35.9% moved out of home. 39.7% worked in Covid units. 7.7% had personal psychiatric history. 76.9% provided direct care to patients with Coronavirus. The frontline staff reported that only 29.5% of patients were stables. Only 48.4% received adequate training of protection against Covid-19. 64.1% of professionals did PCR test and only 16.7% of them tested positive. We objectified an increase of 6.4% in the anxiolytics use. Stigma affected 57.7% of professionals. We highlighted a link between anxiety and social support strategy (p=0.048). 92.3 % of the staff suffered from anxiety according to Beck Anxiety Inventory. Conclusions: Screening anxiety among frontlinemedical and paramedical staff might enhance their productivty and thus provide patients with the best care.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Based on the Portuguese guidelines, we have developed the Adherence Scale to the Recommendations for Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic (ASR-MH-COVID19) to better understand this health behaviour.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1268 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
