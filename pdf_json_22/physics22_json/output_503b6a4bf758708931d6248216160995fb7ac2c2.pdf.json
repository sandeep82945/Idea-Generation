These studies necessitate high-precision measurements of atomic clock frequency ratios to unprecedented accuracy. In contrast to the earlier claimed highest sensitive coefficient (K) clock transition to \u03b1e in Yb [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 173001 (2018)], we found the 4f146s6p (3P2) \u2212 4f\n135d6s2 (3P \u22172 ) transition of this atom can serve as the clock transition with the largest K value (about \u221225(2)). Moreover, we demonstrate a scheme to attain simultaneous magic trapping conditions for this clock transition with the other two proposed clock transitions 4f146s2 (1S0)\u22124f 146s6p (3P2) and 4f 146s2 (1S0)\u22124f\n135d6s2 (3P \u22172 ); also exhibiting large K values. This magic condition can be realized by subjecting Yb atoms to a bias magnetic field at a particular polarization angle along the quantization axis in an experimental set up. Upon realization, it will serve as the most potential optical lattice clock to probe \u03b1e variation.\nThere has been a tremendous progress in building up ultra-high precision atomic clocks using optical lattices in the last decade reaching 10\u221218 uncertainty level [1\u2013 6]. These clocks are capable of offering better statistics owing to their large signal-to-noise ratio, hence considered as the future primary frequency standard [7]. They operate at magic wavelengths (\u03bbmagic), where the differential Stark shift of a given transition is effectively nullified when the lattice lasers are applied to the atomic systems [8\u201310]. These clocks are not only meant for time keeping devices, they can also be immensely useful for studying a number of fundamental physics of general interest such as probing variation of fundamental physical constants, relativistic geodesy, gravitational-wave detection, search for dark matter and beyond the Standard Model particle physics to name a few [11\u201318]. In order to suppress statistical noise that limits the stability of the clock frequency measurement, synchronous frequency comparison technique based on a large ensemble of atoms are advantageous [19\u201321], which can facilitate measurement of the ratio of frequency beyond the Dick limit [22]. However, simultaneously comparing ratios of more than two clock frequencies in the same optical lattice can make these studies more reliable. This, however, poses many practical challenges for which reducing uncertainties due to light shifts to the intended level may not be feasible. This, therefore, demands to use a single atomic species and trapping them simultaneously at a common magic wavelength. Obviously, it is not an easy task to achieve such a goal in an atomic clock candidate straightforwardly but can be feasible by slightly tweaking the experimental set up. For this purpose, we intend to\nmake use of the polarization angle along the quantization axis in the clock frequency measurement by applying a bias magnetic field.\nThe 578 nm line of the 4f146s2 (1S0)\u22124f146s6p (3P0) transition in neutral ytterbium (Yb) is currently serving as one of the most accurate frequency standards [4, 6, 10]. This transition has a widely-used \u03bbmagic at 759 nm [23, 24] and several other \u03bbmagic values in the shorter wavelength range [25]. Recently, it was demonstrated that the transitions 4f146s6p (3P0) \u2212 4f135d6s2 (3P \u22172 ), 4f\n146s2 (1S0) \u2212 4f146s6p (3P2) and 4f146s2 (1S0) \u2212 4f135d6s2 (3P \u22172 ) can be served as additional clock transitions in Yb [26, 27] having the highest sensitivity coefficient (K) to variation of the fine structure constant (\u03b1e). In this Letter, we demonstrate that the 4f146s6p (3P2) \u2212 4f135d6s2 (3P \u22172 ) transition in Yb can suffice as a new clock transition and has larger K value than the previously claimed highest K value for the 3P0 \u22123 P \u22172 clock transition [26]. This is further strengthened by finding a triply magic trapping condition to trap and carry out simultaneous clock frequency measurements for the 1S0\u22123P2, 1S0\u22123P \u22172 , and 3P2\u22123P \u22172 clock transitions on common optical lattice to suppress the Stark shifts (see Fig. 1) drastically.\nFor carrying out the analysis, we have calculated the reduced matrix elements (RMEs) of the electric dipole (E1), electric quadrupole (E2), magnetic dipole (M1), and magnetic quadrupole (M2) operators in Yb using the multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) method [28\u201330]. We have considered electron correlation effects due to both the Coulomb and Breit interactions [31].

The SE QED corrections are evaluated based on an expression derived using screened hydrogenic contributions [32]. The VP QED corrections are estimated using an analytical expression derived for the lowest-order term by Fullerton and Rinker for the Uehling model potential and for the next leading-order term as given in Ref. [33]. Using the RMEs of the E2, M1, and M2 operators, we have estimated lifetimes of the 3P2 and\n3P \u22172 metastable states of Yb in order to demonstrate that the 3P2 \u22123 P \u22172 transition is apt to be used for the atomic clock along with other clock transitions. As shown in Fig. 1, the states associated with this clock transition have open-4f shell configurations. Thus, it is extremely challenging to evaluate atomic wave functions of these states accurately to which we have considered a very large set of configuration state functions (CSFs) in our MCDHF method to obtain the results reliably. We find that the lifetime of the 3P2 state is about 16 s against the earlier reported values as 15 s [27] and 14.5 s [34]. Our estimated lifetime of the 3P \u22172 state comes out to be 190 s, which agrees better with the value 200 s reported in Ref. [27] but devi-\nates from other ab initio result 1300 s and semi-empirical value 55 s [26]. Our investigation reveals that both the 3P2 and 3P \u22172 states decay to the 3P1 state predominately by the M1 channel with the branching ratios as 0.93 and 0.98, respectively. Similarly, our calculation offers lifetime of the 3P1 state as 875 ns, which is consistent with the most precise experimental value 865(6) ns [35] and previous measurement 850(50) ns [36], while differs considerably from the another theoretical prediction 500 ns reported in Ref. [27]. This justifies about reliability of our calculations using large CSFs in the MCDHF method. Owing to short lifetime, this state will help in repumping the atoms back to the ground state, and the 1S0\u22123P1 transition can be used for narrow-line cooling to achieve \u00b5K temperature [37, 38]. It can be noted that the metastable state 3P0, that is part of the traditional clock state, will behave as a dark state as it will not play any active role in our scheme. This is because any decay to this state from other metastable states involved with the clock transitions are highly forbidden, and any possible leakage to this state is further prohibited strongly to the ground 1S0 state in the bosonic Yb isotopes. During the repumping process, the fraction of atoms leaked to the 3P0 metastable state can be calibrated [39]. Otherwise, a 649 nm laser pulse can be used to pump atoms from this state back to the ground state via the 4f146s7s (3S1) state [40].\nThe important properties of the relevant clock transitions in Yb are summarized in Table I. The 3P0 \u2212 3P \u22172 transition was demonstrated by Safronova et al. [26] for development of a dual fermionic clock combining with the traditional 1S0 \u22123 P0 clock transition. The linewidth of this clock transition, however, can be increased by the hyperfine quenching. In contrast, we suggest to use the 3P0 \u22123 P \u22172 transition in the bosonic Yb isotope for the atomic clock which can have a narrow linewidth due to the forbidden E2 channel. The choice of bosonic isotope can offer enhanced quality (Q) factor due to the fact that it will be free from the hyperfine quenching (nonetheless\n3\nthis transition in a fermionic Yb isotope can still offer a reasonably large Q factor). As stated earlier, simultaneous magic conditions for the 1S0 \u22123 P0 and 3P0 \u22123 P \u22172 clock transitions do not seem to be feasible. On the other hand, the 1S0 \u22123 P2 transition in bosonic Yb has similar natural linewidth and Q factor with the traditional 1S0 \u22123 P0 clock transition in 171Yb. In addition, it has a larger K value to probe \u03b1e variation. The\n1S0 \u22123 P \u22172 transition has even larger Q and K factors. Compared to these earlier proposed clock transitions, we find that the 3P2 \u22123 P \u22172 transition has the largest K factor (about 80 times larger than the 1S0 \u22123 P0 transition). Also, owing to its 9.8 mHz narrow linewidth, the 2875 nm infrared wavelength possesses Q factor about 1.1\u00d7 1016. Neither this value of Q nor wavelength of the laser that will be applied to interrogate the clock transition would limit the stability of our proposed atomic clock. These analyses suggest that the 1S0\u22123P2, 1S0\u22123P \u22172 and 3P2\u22123P \u22172 transitions can be as competitive as the 1S0 \u22123 P0 transition for clock frequency measurements in Yb. Our MCDHF calculation gives K factor for the 3P2 \u22123 P \u22172 transition as \u221225(2). Using empirical relations for the K factors of the 1S0 \u22123 P2 and 1S0 \u22123 P \u22172 transitions from Refs. [26, 27], we find K value for the 3P2 \u22123 P \u22172 transition as \u221228.6(2.0) agreeing well with our result. We also suggest that the 1S0 \u22123 P2 and 1S0 \u22123 P \u22172 clock transitions can work as synthetic frequency standard [42, 43] as \u03b1e varying coefficients in these transitions have opposite signs. Thus, the 3P2 \u22123 P \u22172 transition bestows to offer us a new direction towards development of next-generation highprecision frequency standards.\nOur next utmost requirement would be to assess simultaneous magic \u03bbmagic values for the aforementioned three clock transitions to minimize uncertainties in the clock frequency measurements, which requires accurate determination of dynamic E1 polarizabilities (\u03b1(\u03c9)) of the considered states of Yb for a wide range of angular frequency \u03c9.\nExpression for \u03b1(\u03c9) is given by [44, 45]\n\u03b1(\u03c9) = \u03b1S(\u03c9) + CVJM (A, \u03b8k)\u03b1V (\u03c9) + CTJM (\u03b8p)\u03b1T (\u03c9), (1)\nwhere \u03b1S , \u03b1V and \u03b1T are known as the scalar, vector and tensor components, respectively, and CVJM (A, \u03b8k) and CTJM (\u03b8p) are two polarization-angle-dependent coefficients and given by\nCVJM (A, \u03b8k) = Acos\u03b8k M\n2J , (2)\nand\nCTJM (\u03b8p) = 3cos2\u03b8p \u2212 1\n2\n3M2 \u2212 J(J + 1) J(2J \u2212 1) . (3)\nHere A represents the degree of polarization defined by polarization angle \u03c6 as A = sin2\u03c6, \u03b8k is the angle between the wave vector of the light and the quantization axis chosen as the direction of the magnetic field, \u03b8p is the angle between the polarization vector and the quantization axis, and M is the projection of the total angular momentum J at the quantization axis. Using the calculated E1 RMEs and experimental energies [47], the dominant valence electron correlation contributions to each component of \u03b1(\u03c9) are determined. The other contributions from the core and core-valence electron correlations are estimated using mixed many-body methods. We have listed their static (\u03c9 = 0) and dynamic (\u03c9 = 1056 nm) values along with uncertainties of the 1S0, 3P2 and 3P \u22172 states from our calculations in Table II. We have also compared the static values with the latest theoretical calculation [27] and another work that constraints the value by analyzing several E1 matrix elements using the experimental data [46]. We find overall agreement among our results with the previous calculation [27] except for the \u03b1T value of the 3P \u22172 state (\u22120.04(1.00) a.u. and \u22126 a.u.). After a thorough investigation we observe that the large difference mainly comes due to different order of contributions arising from the low-lying resonant transitions. We find that the first six resonances that have the transition energies between 1300-9506 cm\u22121 give almost all contributions to the determination of E1 RMEs. Among these six states, the most dominant contribution to the \u03b1T value comes from the 3P \u22172 \u2212 4f13 6s2 6p J = 3 resonance line, amounting to \u22121.25 a.u.. Consideration of very large number of CSFs in our MCDHF calculations improves the accuracy of the transition energies. The difference between our calculated values and the experimental results [47] is reduced to be less than 200 cm\u22121 compared to >1000 cm\u22121 in Ref. [27]. Using the calculated static \u03b1S values of the 1S0, 3P2 and 3P \u22172 states of Yb from this work, we estimate the black-body radiation (BBR) shifts at the room temperature of the 1S0 \u22123 P2, 1S0 \u22123 P \u22172 and 3P2 \u22123 P \u22172 clock transitions as 3.9(4) \u00d7 10\u221215, 2.1(3) \u00d7 10\u221216 and 2.4(2)\u00d7 10\u221214, respectively.

The green circle highlights the triply magic wavelength condition for M = 0 sublevels at \u03bb3magic = 1056.0 nm and \u03b8p = 43.8 \u25e6. References in (c): aExperiment [50],bTheory [51].\nthe temperature can be restricted within mK using techniques like in-vacuum thermal shields [12, 48, 49], uncertainties in the BBR shifts for the 1S0 \u22123 P2, 1S0 \u22123 P \u22172 and 3P2 \u22123 P \u22172 clock transitions can be suppressed below 10\u221218 levels easily. At this stage, we would also like to mention that quadratic Zeeman shift can be small [27] whereas quadrupole shift can be nullified by measuring clock frequencies in all the azimuthal levels in the 3P2 \u22123 P \u22172 transition. In the search of \u03bbmagic, we start with the simple case of linearly polarized light and plot the \u03b1(\u03c9) values for the 1S0\u22123 P2 transition (Fig. 2 (a)) and the 1S0\u22123P \u22172 transition (Fig. 2 (b)) with \u03b8p = 0\n\u25e6 and \u03c6 = 0\u25e6. Fig. 2 (a) shows that the far-off-resonance \u03bbmagic for the\n1S0 \u22123 P2 transition occurs at 1150 nm for the M = 0 sublevel and 1089 nm for the |M | = 1 sublevel. Fig. 2 (b) shows that there exists a \u03bbmagic for the the\n1S0 \u22123 P \u22172 transition at 1057.5 nm for the M = 0 sublevel and 1056.5 nm for the |M | = 1 sublevel, respectively, which are close to the above \u03bbmagic. In the case of the linearly polarized light, \u03b8p is a free parameter that can be monitored to adjust the place of the \u03bbmagic values. In Figs. 2 (c) and (d), we show variation of \u03bbmagic as function of \u03b8p for the 1S0\u22123P2 and 1S0\u22123P \u22172 clock transitions. The dot mark with values \u20181056.0, 43.8\u2019 shown in Fig. 2 (d) indicates a simultaneous magic condition for the 1S0\u22123P2, 1S0\u22123P \u22172\n40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140\nk (deg.)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\nm aj\n( de\ng. )\n(a) 0\n10 20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n43\n43.7\n(deg.)\n0o | | 43.7o\n3magic = 1056.0 nm\n(1S 0 ) = (3P 2 * M=0)\n= (3P 2 M=0)\nFIG. 3. (a) Triply magic trapping conditions for the 1S0, 3P2 M = 0 and 3P \u22172 M = 0 clock states of Yb in different elliptically polarized light. The conditions can be found for 0\u25e6 6 |\u03c6| 6 43.7\u25e6. In the case of all M = 0, the common magic wavelength \u03bb3magic = 1056.0 nm is independent with polarization angles. (b) {\u03b8maj , \u03b8k}-dependent dynamic polarizabilities of the 1S0, 3P2 M = 0 and 3P \u22172 M = 0 sublevels at \u03bb3magic = 1056.0 nm, by choosing \u03c6 = 30 \u25e6 as an example. The surface shape for other polarized light is similar. The green curved line indicates the triple intersection of three surfaces for polarizabilities of three sublevels, where the triply magic trapping conditions are found.\nand 3P2 \u22123 P \u22172 clock transitions with M = 0 sublevels. The reason to use the M = 0 sublevels of the 3P2 and 3P \u22172 states in the clock transition is to nullify the linear Zeeman shift. A similar exercise has been carried out to search for \u03bbmagic values for our interested clock transitions in Yb using circularly polarized light. However, we did not find any simultaneous \u03bbmagic values for the M = 0 sublevels of the 3P2 and\n3P \u22172 states, albeit they can exist for other M sublevels.\nAs seen above we had a limited scope to make use of simultaneous \u03bbmagic for the three\n1S0 \u22123 P2, 1S0 \u22123 P \u22172 and 3P2 \u22123 P \u22172 clock transitions in Yb using the linearly and circularly polarized lasers. To overcome this restriction, we further explore the use of elliptically polarized light to achieve more useful \u03bbmagic values to carry out the experiments, as shown in Fig. 3. Again, we intend to focus only on the M = 0 sublevels of the\n5 clock transitions in order to suppress linear Zeeman effects. This choice can also be helpful to avoid drifting and imperfection in achieving polarization angles as well as guiding direction of the magnetic field. Since the polarization vector is divided into two components as \u03b5\u0302 = ei\u03c3(cos\u03c6\u03b5\u0302maj + i sin\u03c6\u03b5\u0302min), \u03b8p can be defined as cos2\u03b8p = \u221a 1\u2212A2cos2\u03b8maj + 1\u2212 \u221a 1\u2212A2 2\nsin2\u03b8k. Thus, we can only have the independent parameters as \u03c6, \u03b8k and \u03b8maj to manipulate the \u03b1(\u03c9) values as per our experimental need. Fig. 3 (a) shows that it is possible to attain triply magic trapping condition at 1056.0 nm for a suitable of combinations of \u03b8k and \u03b8maj by varying them in a range of 0\u25e6 6 \u03c6 . 43.7\u25e6. This clearly demonstrates that experimental desired triply magic wavelength conditions can be easily engineered by using elliptically polarized light than a \u03c0-polarized light. This is owing to the fact that when \u03c6 is close to 0\u25e6, controlling \u03c6 becomes more challenging for a suitable value of \u03b8maj to attain \u03bbmagic. In contrast, when \u03c6 is close to 43.7\u25e6, fixing \u03b8maj becomes extremely sensitive to attain \u03bbmagic. In order to avoid these uncertainties, we suggest to consider moderate values of \u03c6 for triply magic conditions of the atomic clocks. On the other hand, it would be easier to control \u03b8k than \u03c6 and \u03b8maj in an experiment. To circumvent these problems, we recommend to use \u03c6 = 30\u25e6 and \u03b8k = 90\u25e6, as depicted in Fig. 3 (b), as optimum values of \u03c6 and \u03b8maj to avoid systematic uncertainties due to their fluctuations. This corresponds to |\u03b5\u0302maj | = 2|\u03b5\u0302min|, which is feasible to accomplish with the help of Glan-Taylor laser polarizer and high-precision ellipsometry.\nIn conclusion, we have proposed an optical clock using the 3P2 \u22123 P \u22172 transition possessing the highest sensitivity to the temporal variation of the fine structure constant compared to the previously undertaken optical clock transitions. By analyzing spectroscopic properties, we have demonstrated that its quality factor and blackbody radiation shift are at par with the other clock transitions of the same atom. Furthermore, we have given magic conditions for simultaneous clock frequency measurements in the 1S0\u22123P2, 1S0\u22123P \u22172 and 3P2\u22123P \u22172 clock transitions which will not only be useful for reducing systematic effects, it can also open up the further scope to probe temporal variation of the fine structure constant and other fundamental physics unambiguously.\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos."
