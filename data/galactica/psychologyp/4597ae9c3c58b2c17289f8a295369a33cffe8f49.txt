conclusion From genome and epigenome to secondary metabolism, we provided data about the diversity of the Psidium species. We characterize the Psidium germplasm in relation to the 2n chromosome number, 2C nuclear and GC% values, TPS gene copy number and 5-mC%, generating knowledge about species previously studied and also about others not yet evaluated. In addition, we also explore the secondary metabolism, evidence the phenotypic divergences between Psidium species and individuals, and confirm our hypothesis about the influence of the genome and epigenome. material and methods Plant material. We collected leaf samples from ten Psidium species: Psidium acidum (DC.) Landrum, P. cattleyanum Sabine, P. guajava L., P. guineense Sw., P. myrtoides O.Berg, P. gaudichaudianum Proença & Faria, P. friedrichsthalianum (O.Berg) Nied, P. macahense O.Berg, P. oblongatum O.Berg, and P. rufum Mart. ex DC. Leaves were also collected from hybrids of P. guajava x P. guineense. Individuals not identified by species were kept and denominated as genus Psidium (Psi). Brazilian region of occurrence, phytogeographic domain and 2n chromosome number reported for the species are presented in Table 1. The number of individuals of each species for each analysis is presented in Supplementary Table S1. The localization of occurrence of each access, individual identification and families are presented in Supplementary Table S2. Nuclear 2C value and GC%. Young leaves from each germplasm (Supplementary Table  S2) were used for nuclear 2C value and GC% measurements. Solanum lycopersicum L., 1753, ‘Stupické’ was used as internal standard (2C = 2.00 pg)10. 2 cm2 leaf fragment from each Psidium germplasm and from the S. lycopersicum were simultaneously chopped43 for about 30 s in a Petri dish containing 0.5 mL OTTO-I 44 modified for species of the Myrtaceae family (0.1 M citric acid, 0.5% Tween 20, 50 µg  mL-1 RNAse, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 7% polyethylene glycol 2000 – PEG)37.After adding 0.5 mL of the same buffer, the resulted suspensions were incubated for 3 min, filtered on a 30 μm diameter nylon filter (Partec) in a 2.0 mL microtube, and centrifuged at 100 xg for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and 100 μL of the same buffer was added to the pellet, which was homogenized in vortex and incubated for 10 min. Subsequently, 0.5 mL of modified OTTO-II staining buffer (400 mM Na2HPO4H2O, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 50 µg  mL-1 RNAse, and 75 µg  mL-1 propidium iodide (PI, excitation/emission wavelengths: 480–575/550–740 nm) was added to the10,44. The suspensions were filtered through 20 µm nylon mesh (Partec) into tubes (Partec) and kept for 30 min in the dark. Then, the suspensions were analyzed in a flow cytometer (BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer, Accuri cytometers, Belgium) equipped with a 488 nm laser source to promote emissions at FL2 (615—670 nm) and FL3 (> 670 nm). The fluorescence peaks of the G0/G1 nuclei of each access and the standard were identified in the histograms using BD Accuri™ C6 software. G0/G1 peaks with coefficient of variation (CV) less than 5% were considered for nuclear 2C value measurement in pg by the formula: nuclear 2C value of the access (pg) = [(mean G0/G1 peak channel of the access)*2.00 pg S. lycopersicum]/(mean G0/G1 peak channel of S. lycopersicum). For GC%, nuclear suspensions were generated following the procedure adopted to measure the nuclear 2C value with some modifications: (a) the OTTO I and II buffers were not supplemented with RNAse, and (b) the OTTO II buffer was supplemented with 1.5 μM of 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, excitation/emission wavelengths: 320–385/400–580 nm). The suspensions were analyzed with a Partec PAS flow cytometer (Partec GmbH, Munster, Germany), equipped with an 388 nm UV mercury arc lamp and a GG 435–500 nm band-pass filter. AT% was measured using the formula45%ATsample = %ATstandard*[(RDAPI/RPI)1/r], in which: %ATS. lycopersicum = 64.50% 11,46; R = ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the access/standard; r = 3 for DAPI46. From the AT%, the GC% was calculated by the following formula: GC% = 100—AT%. The data corresponding to the

nuclear 2C value and GC% of Psidium accesses were submitted to clustering by the Toucher method optimized by Euclidean distance, in which the variables were separately evaluated (nuclear 2C value and GC%). The analyses were conducted in the Genes computer program45. Percentage of methylated cytosines (5-mC%) in the genome. The 5-mC% data of P. guajava accesses were revisited from our previous study47. For P. cattleyanum, P. guineense, P. myrtoides, P. gaudichaudianum, P. friedrichsthalianum and Psidium sp. the unpublished 5-mC% was measured based on the methodology used for P. guajava47. Yield and chemical composition of the essential oil. We revisited the data about yield and chemical composition of the essential oil previously published by our research group for P. guajava40,42, P. guineense48 and P. cattleyanum24. For the other accesses, the essential oil was extracted based on the methodology used for P. guajava41. The identification and semi-quantification of the leaf essential oil compounds were performed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID QP2010SE, Shimadzu, Japan) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS QP2010SE, Shimadzu, Japan). For these analyses, the following conditions were adopted: the carrier gas used was He for both detectors with flow rate and linear velocity of 2.80 mL  min− 1 and 50.80 cm  sec− 1 (GC-FID) and 1.98 mL  min− 1 and 50.90 cm  sec− 1 (GC–MS), respectively; injector temperature was 220 °C at a split ratio of 1: 30; fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm); Rtx5MS stationary phase (0.25 μm film thickness); the oven temperature had the following programming: initial temperature of 40 °C, which remained for 3 min and then the temperature was gradually increased at 3 °C  min− 1 until it reached 180 °C, remaining for ten minutes, with a total analysis time of 59.67 min; the temperatures used in the FID and MS detectors are 240 and 200 °C, respectively. The sample used was drawn from the vial in a volume of 1 μL of a 3% solution of essential oil dissolved in 95% hexane. GC–MS analyses were performed in an electron impact equipment with an energy of 70 eV; scanning speed of 1000; scanning interval of 0.50 fragments.sec− 1 and detected fragments from 29 to 400 (m/z). GC-FID analyses were performed by a flame formed by H2 and atmospheric air with a temperature of 300 °C. Flow rates of 40 mL  min− 1 and 400 mL  min− 1 were used for H2 and air, respectively. Identification of the essential oil compounds was performed by comparing the mass spectra in relation to available in the spectrophotometer database (Wiley 7, NIST 05 and NIST 05 s) and by the retention index (RI). For the RI calculation, a mixture of saturated C7-C40 alkanes (Supelco, USA) submitted under the same chromatographic conditions as the OE was used and the adjusted retention time of each compound was obtained using GC-FID. Then, the calculated values for each compound were compared with those in the literature49–51. Correlation analysis. 2C value, GC%, 5-mC%, yield and content of each compound present in the essential oil were subjected to Pearson’s correlation. The analysis was conducted in the R environment39 using the package “Agricolae” (https:// CRAN.R- proje ct. org/ packa ge= agric olae). Terpene synthase gene (TPS) copy number in P. guajava and P. guineense. We showed the polyploidy influence in the copy number of the genes involved with essential oil synthesis, the terpene synthase genes (TPS). These genes encode enzymes that act in essential oil synthesis pathways27,39,52–54. For this, we used the sequence of genes functionally characterized and involved in the synthesis of terpenes (TPS genes), which have been described and available in database ID AB266390.1 and ID MK873024.1. Through the BLAST tool, the similarity of these sequences was evaluated in relation to the TPS genes from the P. guajava genome annotation (data of the research group). The alignments that presented a score of at least 80% were selected for the design of the primers. From this, the primers were designed in the conserved motives of these TPS genes, considering mainly exon regions. Primers were designed and evaluated using the OligoIDTAnalyzer program (IDT). We defined two pairs of primers: the first (F 5’-GGT GGG ATG TCG ATG CTA AA-3’ and R 5’-CTC TTC CTC CGT AAC TCT GTA TTG 3’) specific to one predicted TPS gene orthologue with an amplicon 500 pb; and a general primer pair (F 5’-CGA TTC CGG CTA CTT AGA CATC-3’ and R 5’-GTT CTT CCA GCG TCC CAT ATAC-3’) aligned to the conserved motifs in eight predicted TPS genes of P. guajava genome, corresponding to sequences from 415 to 502 pb. The DNA sequences of the putative TPS were amplified from P. guajava and P. guineense genomic DNA using the primers. Amplification reaction consisted of 50 ng genomic DNA, 200 µM dNTPs, 0.5 µM each R and F primers, 1 U GoTaq enzyme (Promega), 1X GoTaq enzyme reaction buffer and 1.8 mM MgCl2. Amplification conditions were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 1 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplification products were evaluated on 1.5% agarose gel and NanoDrop. Then, DNA probes were generated for each putative gene by a second PCR reaction on the same conditions described above, differing by the labeling with Tetramethyl-rhodamine 5-dUTP (Roche) for the specific or ChromaTide Alexa Fluor 488–5-dUTP (Life Technologies) for the general. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed in slides containing isolated and preserved nuclei to detect the number of hybridization signals corresponding to the TPS genes. Hybridization mix consisted of 50% formamide, 2X SSC and 200 ng of the probe. This mix was applied to the slide, which was covered with a coverslip, sealed with rubber cement and kept at 37 °C for 20 h. Post-hybridization wash was in 2X SSC at 42 °C for 20 min. Slides were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and analyzed on a photomicroscope Olympus BX60 equipped with epifluorescence and an immersion objective 100x/A.N. 1.4. At least 20 nuclei were scrambled for each species and for each gene using a 12-bit CCD digital video camera (Olympus) coupled to the photomicroscope and a computer with a digitizer plate. Captured images were processed by Image ProPlus 6.1 (Media Cybernetics).
