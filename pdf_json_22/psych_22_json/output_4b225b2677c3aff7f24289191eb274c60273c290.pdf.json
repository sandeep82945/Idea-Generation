    "abstractText": "Background and Hypothesis Quantitative acoustic and textual measures derived from speech (\u201cspeech features\u201d) may provide valuable biomarkers for psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). We sought to identify cross-diagnostic latent factors for speech disturbance with relevance for SSD and computational modeling. Study Design Clinical ratings for speech disturbance were generated across 14 items for a cross-diagnostic sample (N=343), including SSD (n=97). Speech features were quantified using an automated pipeline for brief recorded samples of free-speech. Factor models for the clinical ratings were generated using exploratory factor analysis, then tested with confirmatory factor analysis in the cross-diagnostic and SSD groups. Relationships among factor scores, speech features and other clinical characteristics were examined using network analysis. Study Results We found a 3-factor model with good fit in the cross-diagnostic group and acceptable fit for the SSD subsample. The model identifies an impaired expressivity factor and two interrelated disorganized factors for inefficient and incoherent speech. Incoherent speech was specific to psychosis groups, while inefficient speech and impaired expressivity showed intermediate effects in people with nonpsychotic disorders. Network analysis showed that the factors had distinct relationships with speech features, and that the patterns were different in the cross-diagnostic versus SSD groups. Conclusions We report a cross-diagnostic 3-factor model for speech disturbance which is supported by good statistical measures, intuitive, applicable to SSD, and relatable to linguistic theories. It provides a valuable framework for understanding speech disturbance and appropriate targets for modeling with quantitative speech features. .

Here, we regard speech as speech, without making inferences regarding \u201cthought disorder,\u201d a related construct which infers disruptions to thought based on observable changes in speech. A range of speech features appear promising as predictors of psychiatric diagnoses and biomarkers of individual symptom dimensions. We use the term \u201cspeech features\u201d broadly to indicate quantitative metrics derived from speech samples, including phonetic, acoustic and textual measures. Much of the work on speech biomarkers has been done in SSD. For example, SSD diagnosis can be classified with >80% accuracy relative to healthy volunteers (HV) using measurements of semantic distance, which quantify the \u201ccloseness\u201d of the meaning in successive sentences or segments of words.5,6 This strategy can be combined with other automated measurements of syntax/parts-ofspeech,7\u20139 referential ambiguity,9 and metaphoricity.10 Acoustic features (pitch, voice quality, pauses) also successfully predict SSD diagnosis.11 Additionally, transition to psychosis among individuals at clinical high risk can be predicted with 83-97% accuracy using automatic measurements of semantic density,12 detection of metaphorical speech or non-standard meanings,10 and a combination of semantic distance and parts-of-speech.13,14 Speech features are also promising biomarkers for other clinical contexts, including mania,15 depression,16 autism,17 and dementia.18,19 Presumably, speech features predict clinical characteristics by reflecting speech-related symptoms such as decreased prosody, tangentiality, and changes in quantity. However, most studies have used speech features to directly predict diagnosis or outcomes, without relating features to observable speech disturbances.5\u201314 There are weaknesses to this approach. First, there is substantial heterogeneity in speech phenotypes within diagnoses. Cross-diagnostically, and within SSD, positive/disorganized versus negative/impoverished dimensions have been consistently reported;2,20,21 they are poorly and sometimes even negatively correlated with one another.22 Therefore, greater precision may be achieved by modeling specific types of speech disturbance, rather than diagnostic phenotypes as a whole.22\u201324 Second, speech disturbances may be shared across disorders, with implications for underlying neurobiology. We need to define cross-diagnostically valid constructs in order to determine whether speech features can be used consistently across disorders as biomarkers for particular speech phenotypes. Notably, in a large sample (N=1,071), Stein et al. found three factors of speech disturbance (emptiness, disorganization, and incoherence) which were linked to changes in distinct brain regions and valid across diagnoses.25 Speech graph features have been shown to be a good marker of thought disorder in mania and SSD,15 and to be related to cross-diagnostic psychopathological dimensions.26 However, there are few studies examining whether quantitative speech features are consistently related to cross-diagnostic dimensions of speech disturbance. Previous studies have reported factor analyses on rating scales for thought disorder, but results are varied, mostly limited to SSD cohorts, and relevance for computational modeling is unclear. The two-factor model distinguishing impoverished speech (e.g., poverty of speech, latency, concreteness) from .

            "text": "Quantitative features derived from speech are increasingly recognized as valuable predictors and objective biomarkers for psychiatric disorders, notably including schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD).1\u20134 In this paper, we identify cross-diagnostic latent factors for language disturbance, then demonstrate the relevance of these factors for computational linguistic modeling in relation to general psychopathology and in SSD, particularly. Here, we regard speech as speech, without making inferences regarding \u201cthought disorder,\u201d a related construct which infers disruptions to thought based on observable changes in speech.\nA range of speech features appear promising\nas predictors of psychiatric diagnoses and biomarkers of individual symptom dimensions. We use the term \u201cspeech features\u201d broadly to indicate quantitative metrics derived from speech samples, including phonetic, acoustic and textual measures. Much of the work on speech biomarkers has been done in SSD. For example, SSD diagnosis can be classified with >80% accuracy relative to healthy volunteers (HV) using measurements of semantic distance, which quantify the \u201ccloseness\u201d of the meaning in successive sentences or segments of words.5,6 This strategy can be combined with other automated measurements of syntax/parts-ofspeech,7\u20139 referential ambiguity,9 and metaphoricity.10 Acoustic features (pitch, voice quality, pauses) also successfully predict SSD diagnosis.11 Additionally, transition to psychosis among individuals at clinical high risk can be predicted with 83-97% accuracy using automatic measurements of semantic density,12 detection of metaphorical speech or non-standard meanings,10 and a combination of semantic distance and parts-of-speech.13,14 Speech features are also promising biomarkers for other clinical contexts, including mania,15 depression,16 autism,17 and dementia.18,19\nPresumably, speech features predict clinical\ncharacteristics by reflecting speech-related symptoms such as decreased prosody, tangentiality, and changes in quantity. However, most studies have used speech features to directly predict diagnosis or outcomes, without relating features to observable speech disturbances.5\u201314 There are weaknesses to this approach. First, there is substantial heterogeneity in speech phenotypes within diagnoses. Cross-diagnostically, and within SSD, positive/disorganized versus negative/impoverished dimensions have been consistently reported;2,20,21 they are poorly and sometimes even negatively correlated with one another.22 Therefore, greater precision may be achieved by modeling specific types of speech disturbance, rather than diagnostic phenotypes as a whole.22\u201324 Second, speech disturbances may be shared across disorders, with implications for underlying neurobiology. We need to define cross-diagnostically valid constructs in order to determine whether speech features can be used consistently across disorders as biomarkers for particular speech phenotypes. Notably, in a large sample (N=1,071), Stein et al. found three factors of speech disturbance (emptiness, disorganization, and incoherence) which were linked to changes in distinct brain regions and valid across diagnoses.25 Speech graph features have been shown to be a good marker of thought disorder in mania and SSD,15 and to be related to cross-diagnostic psychopathological dimensions.26 However, there are few studies examining whether quantitative speech features are consistently related to cross-diagnostic dimensions of speech disturbance.\nPrevious studies have reported factor\nanalyses on rating scales for thought disorder, but results are varied, mostly limited to SSD cohorts, and relevance for computational modeling is unclear. The two-factor model distinguishing impoverished speech (e.g., poverty of speech, latency, concreteness) from\ndisorganized speech (e.g., tangentiality, derailment, incoherence, neologisms, clanging) is the most consistent.2,20,21 However, \u201cdisorganized speech\u201d is inconsistently defined across studies and encompasses a broad collection of individual symptoms which may require different computational strategies. A 6-factor model has been replicated in SSD but several factors are not likely to be relevant cross-diagnostically (e.g., idiosyncratic: word approximations and stilted speech; referential: echolalia and self-reference).21,27\nThe objective of this study was to delineate\ndimensions of observable speech disturbance suitable as targets for computational modeling in SSD and across diagnoses. First, we used factor analyses to identify and test interpretable models. Then, we evaluated the clinical relevance of the factor scores by comparing severity across diagnostic groups, with the expectation that clinically relevant factors should show different patterns in different groups. Finally, using network analysis, we related the factors to multi-modal speech features cross-diagnostically and within an SSD subgroup."

The 2-factor model identified factors related to disorganized speech and impaired expressivity (decreased speech content and expressiveness), explaining 40% and 12% of the variance, respectively. The 3-factor model also produced the impaired expressivity factor (5% variance) and further divided disorganized speech into items consistent with inefficient speech (poor organization across ideas; 41% of variance) and incoherent speech (nonsensical or unintelligible utterances; 12% of variance). Each model was tested using cFA in both the overall sample and the SSD subgroup.

            "text": "In this study, we identified a 3-factor model that describes speech and language disturbance with good fit in cross-diagnostic and SSD samples. An impaired expressivity factor included items related to decreased quantity and expressiveness. Two interrelated disorganized factors emerged: an inefficiency factor included items describing poorly-related, redundant, or excessive speech, and an incoherent factor included items relating to nonsensical or unintelligible speech. Fittingly, derailment, loss of goal, and poverty of content of speech were cross-loaded on both the inefficient and the incoherent factors. Our confirmatory models suggest a good fit for the 3-factor model in the cross-diagnostic sample, and adequate fit for the SSD subgroup which is comparable to previously reported\nmodels.21 The distinction between impaired expressivity and disorganization-type symptoms is well-replicated in SSD21 and cross-diagnostically.2 Specifically, a latent factor for poverty of thought and decreased expressiveness has been found by other groups and using other rating scales.35,36 Factor analysis of the Thought and Language Index also suggests that unusual word usage, sentence structure, and logic (consistent with our incoherence factor) may be differentiated from distractibility and perseveration (included in our inefficiency factor).37 Overall, our model is very similar to the 3-factor model for formal thought disorder reported by Stein et al. in their crossdiagnostic sample of N=1,071.25 They describe an emptiness factor (poverty of speech and content, increased latency, and blocking), a disorganization\nfactor (tangentiality, circumstantiality, derailment, pressure of speech), and an incoherence factor (incoherence, illogicality, distractibility). The principal differences are that we include decreased vocal inflection in our impaired expressivity factor (since we are looking at speech as a whole, and not specifically thought disorder), and that we prefer the term \u201cinefficiency\u201d over \u201cdisorganization\u201d because \u201cdisorganization\u201d is an overly broad term than can include incoherence and other items. Notably, Stein et al. report distinct correlates to brain structure for their three factors. The similarity between our findings, and the fact that the samples were collected in different languages and rated by different teams, provides added confidence for the 3-factor model we propose.\nThe 3-factor model proposed here can be\nunderstood in the context of linguistic theories on pragmatics. In classical Gricean pragmatics, a speech act is carried out successfully when the addressee is made to recognize the speaker\u2019s communicative intent (\u201cMeaning-intention\u201d or \u201cM-intention\u201d).38,39 Understanding the M-intention necessitates not only deciphering the semantic content (literal meaning) of what is spoken, but also the conversational implicatures which are grounded in the context of the discourse and in the cooperative principle. Per Grice, the cooperative principle assumes that the speaker is always following four maxims: (1) Quantity: be informative, but not overly informative; (2) Quality: be truthful, to the best of one\u2019s knowledge; (3) Relation: be relevant; and (4) Manner: be perspicuous (clear). Along these lines, we can characterize the impaired expressivity factor as violations of the maxim on quantity\u2014specifically, delivery of too little information. Inefficiency and incoherence both involve violations of relation, manner, and (excessive) quantity, but differ in degree. With incoherent speech, the violations are severe to the point of preventing the M-intention from being inferred. With inefficient speech, the violations of the cooperative principle are perceived, but the M-intention can still be ascertained. We can also differentiate between incoherent and inefficient disorganized speech by referring to Grosz\u2019s theories on centering and discourse structure.40,41 She suggests that, just as individual sentences can be broken down into a hierarchical structure of phrases which give meaning to one another, so can discourse be broken into a hierarchy of discourse segments (each containing one or more utterances). In coherent discourse, individual utterances within a discourse segment collaborate to convey the discourse segment purpose (local coherence), and multiple discourse segments relate to one another to satisfy the overall discourse purpose (global coherence). With respect to our work, we would characterize inefficiency as disruptions in global coherence, where there are disruptions or inefficiencies in satisfying the overall discourse purpose, while incoherence arises from disruptions to local coherence that cause the discourse segment purpose to be obscured.\nWe also found distinct and significant diagnosis\ngroup effects for each of the three factors, suggesting that the\nmodel is not just statistically and theoretically sound, but also clinically meaningful. There were intermediate effects for nonpsychotic disorders in inefficiency and impaired expressivity, but incoherence was specific to people with psychosis and rarely elevated in either healthy volunteers or people with nonpsychotic disorders. Intuitively, this pattern may be explained by the sensitivity of impaired expressivity and inefficiency to non-psychiatric (e.g., personality, culture, social context) and non-specific factors (e.g., impaired attention, psychomotor retardation, ruminations and repetitive thinking). In contrast, incoherence may be more specific to psychosis-related brain-changes. This hypothesis should be further evaluated.\nThere were notable differences between the cross-\ndiagnostic and SSD groups in how factor scores related to other clinical characteristics and quantitative speech features. In the cross-diagnostic sample, all clinical characteristics were tightly interrelated, likely representing a common dimension of psychopathology. Impaired expressivity showed the highest betweenness centrality and served as a bridge between clinical characteristics and quantitative speech features. In the SSD subsample, as expected, impaired expressivity was more closely related to negative symptoms like affective flattening, withdrawal, anhedonia, and avolition, while incoherent and inefficient speech were more closely related to positive symptoms like thought disturbance, hostility and suspiciousness. Among SSD, inefficient speech had the highest betweenness centrality, and connected multiple symptom dimensions, functioning, and quantitative speech features. For both groups, each speech factor was closely related to other clinical characteristics but demonstrated distinct relationships with quantitative speech features. Some of the relationships illustrated in our network diagrams reflect those reported in previous works. For example, disorganized speech has been connected with poor functioning and greater cognitive impairment.42 Affective flattening and anhedonia have been related to decreased speaking rate.43,44 In general, we interpret the results from our network analyses to suggest that each speech factor taps consistently into critical clinical phenomena, but that computational modeling should be\npursued separately for the individual factors, and possibly separately for different clinical populations.\nThere were several limitations in our work which\nshould be addressed in future studies. There were heterogeneities in the data collection methods. The network analysis does not account for moderating or confounding variables, such as gender, age, and socioeconomic status. All samples were collected in English and rated with the TLC scale (with 2 SANS items) at a single site. A larger multilingual study using multiple rating scales would further support the generalizability of our findings. The fit of the 3- factor model for other (nonpsychotic) diagnostic groups or within individual SSD diagnoses was not examined because it was outside the scope of this paper. Furthermore, both clinical ratings and quantitative speech features may be affected by the context of the interview and the nature of the task. There may also be group by context effects on speech. The performance of predictive models may be further improved by standardizing and accounting for these variations.\nIn this study, we report a cross-diagnostic 3-factor\nmodel for speech and language disturbance which is supported by good statistical measures, intuitive, applicable to SSD, and relatable to linguistic theories. Impaired expressivity, inefficiency, and incoherence show meaningfully distinct patterns in different diagnostic groups, with incoherent speech being most specific to psychosis. Each factor was closely related to a network of other clinical characteristics but demonstrated distinct relationships to quantitative speech features. The factors also intuitively inspire different computational strategies. In conclusion, the 3-factor model reported here is a valuable framework for understanding speech and language disturbance crossdiagnostically and in SSD particularly, and the factor scores are appropriate targets for modeling with quantitative speech features."
