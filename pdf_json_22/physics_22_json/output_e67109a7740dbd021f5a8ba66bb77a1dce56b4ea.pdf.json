Notably, increasing the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors depends in a very large part on developing new coatings, which entails developing more suitable methods and models to investigate their loss angle. In fact, the most sensitive region of the detection band in such detectors is limited by the coating thermal noise, which is related to the loss angle of the coating. Until now, models which describe only ideal physical properties have been adopted, wondering about the use of one or more loss angles to describe the mechanical properties of coatings. Here we show the presence of a systematic error ascribed to inhomogeneity of the sample at its edges in measuring the coating loss angle. We present a model for disk-shaped resonators, largely used in loss angle measurements, and we compare the theory with measurements showing how this systematic error impacts on the accuracy with which the loss model parameters are known.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe search for low internal friction coatings lies today at the forefront of various branches of Physics requiring ever more accurate measurements of time and space: optical atomic clocks [1] and high-finesse optical cavity for quantum devices [2], laser stabilization [3] and optomechanical resonators [4], or the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors (GWDs) [5, 6], on which depends the emergence of a new branch of astrophysics.\nGWDs are large interferometers in which massive suspended mirrors play the role of gravitational-field probes [7]. The current GWDs mirror coatings are Bragg reflectors, made of titania-tantala (TiO2:Ta2O5) and silica (SiO2) doublets, two amorphous materials with, respectively, high and low refractive indices, and which are deposited by ion-beam sputtering [8\u201311]. After the first successful observation runs [12, 13], GWDs are now entering in an upgrade phase to improve their sensitivity. One of the most critical tasks is to reduce the coating thermal noise, which limits detection in the central band where the interferometers are the most sensitive [14].\nThis thermal noise is especially large in coatings due to their strongly out-of-equilibrium nature. But it is not\n\u2217 a.amato@maastrichtuniversity.nl\nspecific to them. It is found in bulk glass, where it is believed to arise from thermally driven transitions between metastable atomic configurations resulting from structural disorder. Thanks to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, it can be related to internal friction, i.e., the attenuation of mechanical excitations in the bulk of material, a property characterized by loss angles, respectively associated with compressive and shear strains. Precise and reliable measurements of these properties are hence crucial to characterize thermal noise and provide information about its structural origin [15\u201318].\nMost experiments used to access the intrinsic elastic moduli and loss angles in coatings rely on the principle of the resonant method [19], via measurements of the resonance frequencies and internal friction for various types of resonators [20, 21], the more reliable and most used technique being the so-called Gentle Nodal Suspension (GeNS) for disk-shaped resonators. [20\u201323]. In these setups, one may neglect non-viscous dissipation contributions like the thermoelastic loss. However, one does not access independently the targeted loss angles, because every resonant mode combines both compressive and shear contributions. These angles can only be estimated after matching experimental resonance data with a loss model, while taking into account the distribution of local strains in every vibration mode. For this purpose, most of the recent GeNS studies of amorphous coatings assume that, non-viscous dissipation being negligible, the total coatar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n06 10\n6v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .I\nM ]\n1 2\nSe p\n20 22\n2 ing dissipation results only from the bulk internal friction of the deposited material, characterized by the two loss angles one seeks to measure [24, 25].\nIn this work, we show, on the example of GeNS measurements, that this procedure leads to a severe misestimation of the targeted intrinsic loss angles, due to the existence of excess losses arising from the coating edge. A similar edge effect was previously evidenced in uncoated disks [26]. It should be expected to be the rule in coatings [27] because they are highly prone to the existence of edge inhomogeneity arising, e.g., from spills off at the substrate edge or from tapering on the front side due to the sample holder during deposition. Our work shows that a very slight excess of loss at the edge suffices to strongly affect the measured loss at higher frequencies because modes are then increasingly localized near the disk edge. It results in a large error of the fitted intrinsic loss angles. We also point out that a lack of coating near the disk edge introduces an artefact similar to the existence of a negative edge effect, that must also be taken into account in order to access the desired intrinsic loss angles."

It proceeds on the principle of the resonant method [19], via measurements of the resonance frequencies and internal friction of non-coated and coated disks. To interpret measurements of the loss angle made with this device, and access the intrinsic coating loss, it was recently proposed [26] to proceed as follows. First, the system is decomposed into groups of static degrees of freedom, such as shear vs bulk strains, in different subparts of the system, each one being associated with a stored elastic energy and susceptible to various dissipation mechanisms (e.g. structural relaxation and thermoelastic effect). Then, when examining a given resonance of the system, the rate associated with each dissipation mechanism is assumed to be proportional to the averaged stored energy in the corresponding group over a period of vibration for that resonance mode. Thus, a system is divided into several domains (e.g. substrate vs coating, indexed by i) and several groups of degrees of freedom (e.g. bulk vs shear strains, indexed by k); the average elastic energy of group (k, i) over a period of the considered resonance mode is denoted Ei,k; and in each group the dissipation rate via the mechanisms m is assumed to be \u03c6ki,mEi,k. Writing the total energy dissipation rate as the sum of these contributions, the loss angle of the whole (composite) system, associated with the decay of\na single mode, reads:\n\u03c6tot = \u2211 i \u2211 k Di,k {\u2211 m \u03c6ki,m } , (1)\nwhere\nDi,k = Ei,k Etot , (2)\nis the the so-called dilution factor, which depends on the considered resonance mode."

In the following, we assume that the substrate loss \u03c6s does not change during the coating deposition and postdeposition treatments.\nEquation (4) highlights that the measurement of the coating loss angle rests entirely of a precise evaluation of the dilution factor for each resonance mode.\nFrom the geometry of the sample, it is possible to obtain the dilution factor after calculating the energies stored in the either part of the system using finiteelement simulations. This procedure, however, requires a detailed knowledge of the mechanical parameters of both substrate and coating, which may be quite limiting when examining new, lesser known, materials.\nAlternatively, the dilution factor may be directly accessed experimentally via the shift of resonance frequencies after coating deposition, as detailed in Appendix A.

Even though coatings display an evident asymmetry between the normal and longitudinal directions, there are various indications [28, 29] that, when they grow amorphous, this does not usually induce a significant structural anisotropy [30].\nThis justifies focusing on structurally isotropic coatings, the elastic response of which can be assumed to be fully captured by just two elastic constants. Accordingly, we are then led to expect that the film loss can be fully captured to just two contributions associated with either bulk or shear strains [31], in which case Eq. (1) reduces to:\n\u03c6c = Dbulk\u03c6bulk +Dshear\u03c6shear , (6)\nwhere Dbulk, Dshear = 1\u2212Dbulk are the bulk and shear dilution factors, which are computed in Appendix B, which can be found in table III.\nFor a disk, the values of Dbulk and Dshear only depend on the Poisson ratio, and on the radial and azimuthal numbers characterizing each mode. To illustrate the factors affecting the dilution factors, a few resonance modes of a thin disk are displayed in figure 1. As shown in panel a), modes having only azimuthal nodes feature mostly shear strains, hence tend to present the largest Dshear values. In contrast, as illustrated in panel b) and c), as the radial number grows, the modes display increasing areas undergoing compressive strains near antinodes, so that Dshear tends to decrease with m. The resulting dilution factors are displayed in figure 2 as a function of frequency for the same disk.\nThis figure illustrates that the values of the dilution factors for different m\u2019s lie on different curves, which multiple families of modes resonate over the frequency range of interest. This is why typical coating loss angle data [Eq. (6)] is not a single-valued function of frequency but lie on different curves. In contrast, the intrinsic loss angles \u03c6bulk and \u03c6shear are material properties, hence should be continuous functions of frequency."

            "text": "The last step towards the modelling of coating loss consists in considering a proper theory for the dissipation mechanisms. The most common model assumes that dissipation results from two-level systems (or TLS\u2019s), i.e. microstructural elements that flip between states separated by a potential energy barrier, thus inducing fluctuations of the local elastic modulus M , hence a phase\nlag between stress and strain. TLS\u2019s are typically modelled by asymmetric double-well potentials [32], with distributed parameters, in which case the loss angle reads\n\u03c6 = \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u221e 0 ( \u03b4M M ) \u03c9\u03c4 1 + (\u03c9\u03c4)2 g(\u2206, V )d\u2206dV , (7)\nwhere \u03b4M is the variation of the elastic modulus, \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f , \u03c4 = \u03c40 exp(V/kBT )/(1 + exp(\u2212\u2206/kBT )) the characteristic flip time, and where g is the distribution of the asymmetry \u2206 and barrier height V of the asymmetric double-well potential, which accounts for the complexity of the amorphous structure.\nAt that stage, the frequency dependence of \u03c6 is entirely encoded in the integration of Eq. 7, using a particular type of g. To progress, in common oxide materials like silica and tantala, \u2206 and V are typically assumed to be independent and to be, respectively, uniformly and exponentially distributed [33, 34]. The distribution of V being written:\n\u03c5(V ) = 1 V0 e\u2212V/V0 , (8)\nwith V0 a material-dependent constant, one then finds the loss angle \u03c6 to scale as a power law of frequency:\n\u03c6 = \u03c60 (\u03c9\u03c40) \u03b1(T ) , (9)\nwith an exponent \u03b1(T ) = kBT/V0 that grows linearly with temperature.\nSuch a power law dependence of \u03c6 has been observed in vitreous silica at low temperatures [34, 35]. It gives a strong support to the idea that the distribution of V is indeed exponential, yet only in a small energy range corresponding to temperatures up to about 130K. The available evidence coming from this work suggests that at higher temperatures, the exponent \u03b1 no longer grows with temperature but instead drops. This casts doubts on the relevance of a frequency power law estimate for \u03c6 at room temperature, although such fits are commonly employed to analyze experimental data. Thus, while power law fits of the loss angles remain empirically instructive, for lack of a better option, they should be considered with a degree of skepticism.\nLet us also point out that, when power law expressions for the loss angles are used, one sometimes finds Eq. (9) combined with Eq. (6) as follows:\n\u03c6c = DbulkA1f \u03b11 +DshearA2f \u03b12 , (10)\nwith distinct coupling constants A1 and A2, and exponents \u03b11 and \u03b12.\nWithin the TLS model, the constants A1 and A2 result from the material elastic properties, parameters of the TLS distribution and strain couplings; meanwhile, as explained above, the exponents \u03b11 and \u03b12 are expected to be kbT/V0 with V0 the characteristic energy of the TLS distribution. From this standpoint, the coupling constants A1 and A2 are legitimately distinct, but\nthe two exponents \u03b11 and \u03b12 should be equal. Allowing these two exponents to take different values, as sometimes seen in the literature, amounts to introducing implicitly the assumption that there is not one population of TLS, but two, which couple either to the bulk or to the shear strains. This, we think, is rather dubious as the TLS model should instead be interpreted as representing the existence of a single barrier population that couples to both bulk and shear strains."

This so-called edge effect is expected to arise from surface inhomogeneities. In coated resonators, these losses contribute to \u03c6s and are eliminated when evaluating the coating loss \u03c6c via Eq. (4).\nThe present paper emphasizes that a similar effect should arise from the coating edge, hence impacting \u03c6c measurements. Consider, indeed, the bulk and shear dilution factors of Fig. 2: their values for different mode families (i.e. for different values of the radial number m) tend to come closer at higher frequency. Thus, since the intrinsic loss angles \u03c6bulk and \u03c6shear are continuous functions of the frequency, one should expect from Eq. (6) to see a similar trend in \u03c6c, i.e. a relative narrowing of\n5 neutral plane \u03c6s \u03c6c \u03c6edge `\nFIG. 3. Cross-section of the disk, showing the substrate (blue), the bulk of the coating (light red), and the coating edge (deep red).\nthe differences between mode families with the increasing frequency. But existing silica loss data [11] do not follow this trend and visibly show the opposite. In particular, the (0, n) modes, which display their largest strain at the coating edge, tends to deviate more visibly from others at higher frequency. This clearly points to the existence of excess losses at the coating edge, which is expectedly non-uniform due to a variety of issues arising during deposition such as spill-off, tapering due to the sample holder, or lack of adhesion arising from imperfect surface polishing.\nIn order to take these excess edge losses into account, we further divide the coating of a disk of radius R, as sketched in Fig. 3, into a bulk region that extends over all radial distances r < R \u2212 ` and an outer annular ring of width `, i.e. corresponding to r \u2208 [R \u2212 `, R]. The width ` is expected to be smaller than the coating thickness or at least of the same order since this is the only physical length in the problem. Furthermore, we assume the outer annular region to present a different loss angle than the rest of the disk. Applying again Eq. (1), while further separating the bulk and shear energies, the total loss angle now reads:\n\u03c6c = (Dbulk \u2212Dedgebulk)\u03c6bulk + (Dshear \u2212D edge shear)\u03c6shear\n+Dedgebulk\u03c6 edge bulk +D edge shear\u03c6 edge shear .\n(11)\nHere \u03c6c is the total film loss angle, which can be experimentally accessed using equation (4); \u03c6bulk and \u03c6shear are the intrinsic loss angles one seeks to measure to characterize the film; Dedgebulk and D edge shear are the edge dilution factors for the bulk and shear elastic energies; and \u03c6edgebulk and \u03c6edgeshear are loss angles accounting for bulk and shear losses in the outer annular region.\nWe are exclusively concerned by situations in which the edge is small compared with the disk radius, i.e., ` R. In such cases, as we detail in Appendix C (which extends a calculation presented in Ref. [26]), we find that the edge dilution factors are of the form:\nDedgebulk = `\nR \u03b5bulk\nDedgeshear = `\nR \u03b5shear\n(12)\nwhere \u03b5bulk and \u03b5shear are dilution factor densities. The\ntotal film loss angle can then be recast as:\n\u03c6c = Dbulk\u03c6bulk +Dshear\u03c6shear\n+ `\nR \u03b5bulk\u03b4\u03c6\nedge bulk +\n` R \u03b5shear\u03b4\u03c6 edge shear ,\n(13)\nwhere \u03b4\u03c6edgebulk = \u03c6 edge bulk\u2212\u03c6bulk and \u03b4\u03c6 edge shear = \u03c6 edge shear\u2212\u03c6shear are excess losses at the edge compared with the bulk values.\nThe values of \u03b5bulk and \u03b5shear are displayed in Appendix C and in Table III for various modes and parameters. To illustrate our discussion, we display them in Fig. 4 using the same geometric parameters and Poisson ratio as in Figs. 1 and 2. As expected, from our initial discussion of edge effects, they become more spread out at high frequency, because the elastic energy is then increasingly localized on the edge. This sharply contrasts with the bulk and shear dilution factors of Fig. 2 where the values of Dbulk and Dshear for different m are coming closer with the increasing frequency. Thus a rule-ofthumb guess for the importance of edge effects consists in considering the spread in loss angle values between modes of different azimuthal numbers: if it increases, or does not strongly reduce with the increasing frequency, this is a strong indication for the presence of an edge effect."

We will refer to equation (16) as the BSE model (for bulk, shear, and edge).\nHere, in order to better illustrate edge-induced artifacts, we will additionally use the conservative assumption that the same two-level systems couple to both bulk and shear strains, in which case \u03b11 = \u03b12 = \u03b1. In addition, we will consider for simplicity that the excess edge loss angles are frequency-independent and identical, \u03b4\u03c6edgebulk = \u03b4\u03c6 edge shear = \u03b4\u03c6 edge, a constant, in which case, the two edge terms `R\u03b5bulk\u03b4\u03c6 edge bulk+ ` R\u03b5shear\u03b4\u03c6 edge shear = ` R\u03b5\u03b4\u03c6 edge with \u03b5 = \u03b5bulk + \u03b5shear. Thus restricted, the BSE model comprises only four parameters: A1, A2, \u03b1, and \u03b4\u03c6\nedge. An experimentalist studying this material may be tempted to fit \u03c6c using equation (10), which we henceforth call the BS (bulk and shear) model. This model overlooks edge effects and uses different power law exponents for bulk and shear losses, thus comprising four fitting parameters, A1, A2, \u03b11, and \u03b12.\nIn order to simulate the experimental process, we use the BSE model to generate a complete set of \u03c6c values for the low frequency modes of a 75 mm silica disk. Specifically, we assume the coating has a Poisson ratio \u03bd = 0.16, and an exponent \u03b1 = 0.3, a value that was found in silica at 100K [34, 35], and which is hence highly plausible for coatings in a low temperature range. In addition, as seen on Fig. 5a, we targeted a total film loss angle in the range of 10\u22124, which is typical of low noise applications, while making sure, for the sake of the illustration, that the edge term `\u03b5\u03b4\u03c6edge remained at least 3 times smaller than the other contributions for each frequency.\nAfter adding a 5% error on every data point, we fit these data using the BS model, equation (10): the BS fit, displayed in Fig. 5b, is remarkably convincing, although erroneous by construction. The parameters used to generate the data and the fit results are listed in table I. We see from their comparison that the fitted material properties (A1, A2, \u03b11 and \u03b12) are grossly erroneous even though the edge loss contribution is quite small compared with all other terms. It is especially striking that the fitted power law exponents present distinct values, while the idealized BSE material does not. For the sake of completeness, we examined (not shown) cases when \u03b11 and \u03b12 are distinct in the BSE model, and found that the fitted exponents (as well as A1 and A2) are again systematically grossly erroneous. Moreover, when the edge loss contribution increases and approaches the bulk and\n8 shear contributions, we also found that the fitted exponents may become negative, which is unphysical.\nIt follows from these observations that presence of a very small edge effect induces a severe error on the intrinsic loss properties of the film as deduced from BS fitting.\nLet us now use our test scenario in order to illustrate how an incomplete coating also distorts the measurement of material properties. A case of interest for most deposition methods when the sample holder covers the edge of the disk during deposition. We thus consider that the coating is just the same material as in the above example, and is deposited on an identical 3\u201d disk with a \u03bd = 0.16 Poisson\u2019s ratio. However, we now assume that a the edge effects arises solely from the absence of coating over a ` = 0.5mm outer rim. The coating loss angle hence is described by the following equation:\n\u03c6c = A1\n( f\n10kHz\n)\u03b11 ( Dbulk \u2212 `\nR \u03b5bulk ) +A2 ( f\n10kHz\n)\u03b12 ( Dshear \u2212 `\nR \u03b5shear ) (17) which is identical to Eq. (16), yet for \u03b4\u03c6edgebulk and \u03b4\u03c6 edge shear values that are opposite to their bulk counterpart. As before, we fit the resulting loss angle data using the BS model so as to mimic an erroneous analysis. The fit, which is displayed in Fig. 5d looks excellent with an MSE of 0.006. While the fitted values of A1 and A2 remain comparable with the actual values, the exponent \u03b11 is tainted with an error of over 30% and more strikingly the exponents appear to be different while they actually are not.\nTherefore, to access material properties, one should worry about the possible tapering of the coating at the edge. When the coating is incomplete, one should fit the data using an equation of the form (17) with a precise measurement of the width ` of the uncoated region. One may further need to consider a model comprising both the tapering and an edge contribution arising from the outer rim of the coated area."

            "text": "Let us now assess the relevance of the edge effect to the analysis of real data. For this purpose, we consider room temperature loss angle measurements for tantala (Ta2O5) and silica (SiO2) coatings deposited under the same conditions as those used for the manufacture of gravitationalwaves detectors [11], namely by ion-beam sputtering at the Laboratoire des Mate\u0301riaux Avance\u0301s. In both cases, to avoid additional stress coming from the mismatch of mechanical properties between substrate and coating, deposition was performed on both sides of a silica disk-shaped resonator ( 50 mm and 75 mm and 1 mm thick).\nThe coating loss angles data were fitted with either the BS [Eq. (10)] or the BSE model [Eq. (16)]. For the BSE fit, we tried to use different power law exponents or distinct excess edge loss angles for the bulk and shear components. However, we found that the MSE (which depends on the number of fitted parameters) is smaller when using a unique power law exponent and a unique excess loss angle. Moreover, we found that the power law exponents was so small that it was compatible with zero. This is consistent with the observation by Travasso et al. [34, 35] that \u03b1 grows linearly with T , as predicted by the TLS theory, only up to about 120K, but decreases significantly with the further increase of temperature. This led us to use a reduced BSE model in which \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 0 and with a single excess edge contribution, hence comprising overall just three fitting parameters:\n\u03c6c = A1Dbulk +A2Dshear + `\nR \u03b5\u03b4\u03c6edge (18)\nSubsequently, we refer to this model as the reduced BSE, or BSE-r for short.\nWe fit both Ta2O5 and SiO2 coatings data using either the BS or BSE-r models. The fit parameters are reported in table II and the fits in the left panels of Figure 6. The right panels of this figure present a decomposition of the loss angle into the bulk, shear, and edge contributions (each of which is weighted by the proper dilution factor), as deduced from the BSE-r fit.\nFor Ta2O5, the BSE-r fit has only a slightly larger MSE that the BS one, yet within a range compatible with irreducible experimental errors. As we already said, the BS fit is problematic for two reasons. First, because the TLS model is not demonstrated to hold up to room temperature. Second, because even if it extended up to these conditions, one should expect both bulk and shear exponents to display a unique value, whereas the fit only works for widely different values of \u03b11 and \u03b12. For these reasons, the reduced BSE fit is far more satisfactory. It hence supports that: (i) the bulk and shear loss angles are essentially frequency-independent on the investigated range (1 kHz to 40 kHz); (ii) the edge contribution is systematically smaller than the bulk and shear ones; (iii) strikingly, this small edge contributions suffices to mislead the BS fit into predicting spurious frequency dependencies of the bulk and shear loss angles.\nFor SiO2, the BS fit is grossly inconsistent since it yields an A1 value which in negative. Instead, the BSEr fit works remarkably well and displays an MSE which is three times smaller than the BS one. Compared with the Ta2O5 data, the edge term has a comparable magnitude, ranging between 1\u00d7 10\u22125 and 1\u00d7 10\u22124, while the shear and bulk contributions are smaller. This results in a stronger relative importance of the edge contribution, which may be larger than some bulk contributions (compare the upper triangle and squares in the bottom right panel of Fig. 6). This effect would seem to explain why the BS fit works so poorly for SiO2 coatings.\nFinally, when fitting SiO2 coatings data, we noted that\n10\nthe BSE-r fit produces A1 and A2 values that are close to one another. This led us to perform, tentatively, an even more reduced fit, which we call BSE-r\u2019, in which it is assumed that A1 = A2. In such a case, the loss angle reduces to the remarkably simple expression:\n\u03c6c = A+ `\nR \u03b5\u03b4\u03c6edge (19)\nwith A \u2261 A1 = A2 being a constant. This fit works remarkably well, and displays a smaller MSE than the BSE-r one. It predicts that the frequency dependence of \u03c6c comes solely from the edge term, more specifically, from the edge dilution factor density \u03b5. This is consistent with the observation that, in silica coatings, the \u03c6c values for different mode families (different radial numbers) are strongly splitted at higher frequency, a signature of excess edge loss contributions.\nThe reason why A1 and A2 should be identical on fundamental grounds remains uncertain. It would seem to suggest that, in silica, the bulk and shear strains are strongly coupled and disperse energy via a unique channel, an idea that is certainly worth exploring in the future."

Excess edge losses may arise from a variety of reasons such as, to name a few: coating thickness non-uniformity at the edge, coating spill-off during the deposition, tapering due to the sample holder during deposition, or coating deposition on an unpolished surface and an associated lack of adhesion near the edge. They are hence expected to be widespread and should be systematically assessed when analyzing experimental data.\nBy producing artificial loss data, we showed that this excess edge loss contribution could introduce a significant error in the fitted values of the bulk and shear loss angles. This idea was confirmed by the analysis of experimental data for Ta2O5 and SiO2 coatings. The BS model, indeed, appeared at best suspicious (\u03b11 6= \u03b12) and at worst fully inconsistent. Meanwhile, the BSE-r model introduces a very limited set of assumptions and fewer parameters, while yielding a mean-square error that is comparable (Ta2O5) or much smaller (SiO2).\nThese results unambiguously support that coating loss angle measurements are affected by an excess edge contribution which, although small in value, dramatically affects the fitting procedure and may lead to the attribution of erroneous values to the bulk and shear loss angles, which are the key intrinsic material properties targeted by these measurements. In particular, it now appears that, in room temperature conditions, over the accessible frequency range, any frequency-dependence of \u03c6bulk and \u03c6shear is too small to be measurable using GeNS data."

By solving the integral for the bare substrate thickness h along z, we obtain\nKs = 1\n2 \u03c1sh\u03c9\n2 s \u222b w2s(r, \u03b8)rdrd\u03b8 , (A2)\nwhereas for a sample coated on both sides, with a coating thickness c,\nKtot = 1\n2 \u03c1tot(h+ 2c)\u03c9\n2 tot \u222b w2tot(r, \u03b8)rdrd\u03b8 . (A3)\nSince the kinetic energy must be equal to the elastic energy, it is possible to write 1 2 \u03c1sh\u03c9 2 s \u222b w2s(r, \u03b8)rdrd\u03b8 = Es , 1\n2 \u03c1tot(h+ 2c)\u03c9\n2 tot \u222b w2tot(r, \u03b8)rdrd\u03b8 = Etot . (A4)\nThe integrals in equations (A4) depend on the mode shape w(r, \u03b8) of the disk (see appendix B). The elastic energy of the substrate Es and of the coated sample Etot can be evaluated analytically [36].\nSince the coating is substantially small compared to the substrate, it reasonable to assume that the mode shape of the coated disk wtot is equal to that of the bare disk ws. This implies also that the neutral plane \u2013 the imaginary surface that has zero deformation at all times during the oscillation \u2013 remains in the same position. Under this assumption, dividing each members of equations (A4) we obtain\n\u03c1sh\n\u03c1tot(h+ 2c) ( \u03c9s \u03c9tot )2 = Es Etot . (A5)\nConsidering that Etot = Es + Ec and that A\u03c1sh = ms and A\u03c1tot(h+2c) = mtot, where A is the area of the disk and ms, mtot the mass of the disk before and after the coating deposition, respectively, we obtain\nD = 1\u2212 ms mtot ( \u03c9s \u03c9tot )2 . (A6)\n11\nwhere D = Ec/Etot is the dilution factor. Equation A6 is very important because it gives the dilution factor as a function of measurable parameters, without any prior knowledge of coating elastic constants or thickness. The masses and frequencies after coating deposition are significantly different from those of the bare substrates, so that they can be measured with an analytical balance and a GeNS system, respectively. However, the validity of equation A6 is based on the homogeneity of the coating on the entire surface of the substrate. Since the resonant frequency depend on the disk curvature, the same coating must be deposited on both sides of the substrate, avoiding additional stress and bending of the sample [20]. A work dedicated to the stress dependence of the mode frequencies will be submitted soon by some of the authors.\nOnce the substrate loss is subtracted from the measurements, the coating can be considered as an independent disk. Indeed, assuming that the coating dissipation pathways can be related to angles \u03c61, \u03c62,. . . , the total loss angle reads\n\u03c6tot = (1\u2212D)\u03c6s +D (D1\u03c61 +D2\u03c62 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) , (A7) with D = Ec/Etot: we see that the coatings dilution factors are Di = Ei/Ec can be calculated by identifying the energies stored in the coating subdomains and degrees of freedom only."

Therefore, for each mode (m,n) it is possible to integrate the infinitesimal energies B13 and B14. The coefficient Am,n simplifies once the ratio is performed. All along this article we have considered the mode shapes wm,n as they come from a substrate of fused silica with \u03bd = 0.16. The coating can have a different Poisson\u2019s ratio but its thickness is so small that in first approximation the mode shapes wm,n are fixed only by the substrate properties. Only exception at this approximation is when the coating Poisson\u2019s ratio is very close to 0.5. In that case, the coating bulk energy becomes dominant over that of the substrate, but this is not the case.\nThe bulk dilution factors Dbulk = Ebulk/E values are reported in table III for some modes. In figure 2 the values of the bulk and shear dilution factor are plotted, considering Dshear = 1\u2212Dbulk. It can be observed that the modes having only angular nodes, therefore those whose deformation is mostly at the edge, are largely dominated by shear deformations.\n12"

In figure 4 the dilution factor \u03b5 at typical resonance frequency for a 75 mm silica disk 1 mm thick is shown. It can be observed from the figure that \u03b5 follows a trend in which one can identify the separation of modes in families. Each family is identified by the ra-\n13\ndial node number m as shown in figure 1. In each family the higher angular node number the more the vibration is confined to the edge.\nThe values of the bulk and shear dilution factor evaluated at the edge of a disk-shaped resonator are plotted in figure 4.\n[1] T.
