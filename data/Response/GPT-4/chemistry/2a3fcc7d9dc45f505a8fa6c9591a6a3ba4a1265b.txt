Development of Novel Green Extraction Technologies: Investigate and develop innovative green extraction techniques that are more efficient, sustainable, and can preserve the bioactive properties of phenolic compounds to a greater extent. This could include exploring new solvents that are environmentally friendly and more effective at extracting phenolic compounds or combining existing methods to enhance yield and bioactivity.

Enhanced Bioaccessibility and Stability Studies: Conduct detailed research on the bioaccessibility and stability of phenolic compounds from Hibiscus sabdariffa under various gastrointestinal conditions. This could involve engineering nanoencapsulation or microencapsulation techniques to improve the stability and bioavailability of these compounds in the digestive tract, potentially leading to more effective dietary supplements or functional foods.

Mechanistic Studies on Obesity and Related Disorders: Deepen the research into the mechanisms by which Hibiscus sabdariffa phenolic extracts exert their anti-obesity effects and impact related metabolic disorders. This could involve both in vitro and in vivo studies focusing on gene expression, hormonal modulation, and the specific pathways affected by these compounds, providing clearer targets for therapeutic intervention.

Comparative Studies of Hibiscus Varieties: Perform comparative studies on different varieties of Hibiscus sabdariffa and other Hibiscus species to identify those with the highest concentration of bioactive phenolic compounds. This research could extend to the evaluation of the effects of growing conditions, harvesting times, and post-harvest processing on phenolic content, aiming to optimize these factors for maximum bioactivity.

Impact of Hibiscus Phenolic Extracts on Gut Microbiota and Overall Health: Investigate the long-term effects of consuming Hibiscus sabdariffa phenolic extracts on the human gut microbiota composition and its relationship with overall health and disease prevention. This could include human clinical trials to assess changes in microbiota diversity, the impact on metabolic health, and potential benefits for conditions beyond obesity, such as cardiovascular health and immune function.
