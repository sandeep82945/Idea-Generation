            "text": "Page 2/41\nIntroduction Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one the most important staple crop for the global food security more speci cally for Asian countries where more than 60% of the world\u2019s population live (Khush 2005). To meet the food requirement for the burgeoning population, the global rice production has to increase up to 852 MT by 2035 (Brar and Khush 2018). As the genetic variability is limited within the cultivated rice genepool, the enhancement in productivity will depend upon the use of crop wild relatives (CWRs) of primary genepool of AA-genome, and species of secondary and tertiary gene pools (Brar and Khush 2003). CWRs provide immense scope for widening the variability in the cultivated rice germplasm (McCouch et al. 2012, 2013; Khush 2013). Extensive genetic, cytogenetic and molecular studies have established that rice genus Oryza includes two cultivated (2n = 24; AA genome) and 22 wild species (2n = 24, 48) represented by six diploid (AA, BB, CC, EE, FF and GG) and ve tetraploid (BBCC, CCDD, KKLL, HHKK and HHJJ) genomes (Vaughan 1989; Ge et al. 1999a; Lu et al. 2009; Stein et al. 2018). The cultivated rice species, O. sativa was domesticated from the progenitor O. ru pogon; whereas O. glaberrima was domesticated from O. barthii. The AA-genome consists of two cultivated (O. sativa and O. glaberrima) and six wild species namely, O. nivara, O. ru pogon, O. barthii, O. longistaminata, O. glumaepatula and O. meridionalis. All the AA-genome species are diploid, cross compatible and show homologous pairing of the chromosomes (Vaughan et al. 2008; Alsantely et al. 2023). The weedy types of cultivated rice have been named as O. spontanea in Asia and O. stap i in Africa. These weedy species are more closely related to O. ru pogon and O. nivara in Asia, and O. barthii and O. longistaminata in Africa (Zhu and Ge 2005). Oryza species, which naturally grow in India, are O. sativa, O. nivara, O. ru pogon, O. sativa f. spontanea (all AA-genome species), O. o cinalis (CC), O. minuta (BBCC), O. granulata (GG), O. meyeriana (GG) and O. coarctata (KKLL) (Joseph et al. 1999; Lu and Sharma 2003; Singh et al. 2018). The wild species of Oryza possess undesirable morphological traits such as poor plant type and grain quality, grain shattering and low grain yield (Xu and Sun 2021; Fornasiero et al. 2022). Though the CWRs are inferior in morphological traits, they possess repertoire of useful genes for resistance to biotic, abiotic stress and grain quality as well as yield-related traits (Jena 2010; Sanchez et al. 2013).\nPage 3/41\nUnderstanding the extent and type of genetic variation in wild rice populations can help to identify genotypes with desirable traits for conservation and utilization in crop improvement (Vaughan et al. 2005). For effective utilization of CWRs in plant breeding programmes, these need to be well-characterized and evaluated. The characterization of germplasm could be accomplished by morphological, biochemical and molecular methods. Traditionally, the characterization of CWRs is done by using morphological traits because these are phenotypebased, inexpensive and could be used to screen entire germplasm. Based on morphology and sexual a nity, Juliano et al (1998) characterized 64 accessions of wild rice using 28 morphological traits. Similarly, Singh et al (2013) evaluated 35 wild rice accessions of O. ru pogon and O. nivara with 14 morphological traits for diversity analysis. The morphological markers have been used for diversity analysis and classi cation of CWRs of rice by numerous researchers in India (Patra et al. 2008; Samal et al. 2018; Tiwari et al. 2020), China (Dong et al. 2010), Srilanka (Sandamal et al. 2021), Costa Rica (Arrieta-Espinoza et al. 2005) and Tanzania (Mangosongo et al. 2018). However, these markers are multigenic and environmentally in uenced, tissue-speci c and the levels of polymorphism detected using them are limited. The genetic identity of the Oryza species in the O. sativa-nivararu pogon complex and their interspeci c hybrids could not be established with morphological traits only (Singh et al. 2018). However, this limitation could be overcome by using DNA-based markers for diversity assessment, population structure and genetic differentiation of wild rice germplasm.\nDNA-based markers are valuable tools for ngerprinting genotypes, varietal identi cation, analyzing genetic diversity, population structure and phylogenetic studies (Parker et al. 1998; Nagaraju et al. 2002). Several DNAbased markers have been used for the molecular characterization of wild rices such as Random Ampli ed Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) (Buso et al. 1998; Ge et al.1999b; Ren et al. 2003), Ampli ed Fragment Length Polymorphs (AFLPs) (Aggarwal et al, 1999), pSINE1 retrotransposons (Ohtsubo et al. 2004; Singh et al. 2018), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) (Sarla et al. 2003; Dong et al. 2010; Samal et al. 2018), Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSRs) (Joshi et al. 2000; Haritha et al. 2016) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) (Xu et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2022). Among these DNA-based markers, SSRs or microsatellites were the most widely used markers in genotyping of plants in last decade (Mason 2015). These molecular markers are preferred because of their high reproducibility, co-dominant inheritance, greater polymorphism, easy analysis and cost e ciency. Numerous researchers have studied molecular characterization of CWRs of rice by using SSR markers (Brondani et al. 2005; Gao et al. 2005; Orn et al. 2015; Samal et al. 2018; Labarosa et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2022). The aim of the study was to assay the diversity, population structure and genetic differentiation in the CWRs of rice, mainly O. nivara and O. ru pogon for utilization in genetic improvement of cultivated rice genepool.\nMaterials and Methods\nGermplasm of rice crop wild relatives The experimental materials consisted of 96 Oryza accessions belonging to seven wild, one intermediate and two cultivated species of rice acquired from Indian National Gene Bank, ICAR-National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), New Delhi. The wild rice species mainly consisted of AA genome (94 accessions) and CC genome (O. O cinalis; two accessions) of genus Oryza. Of the 96 accessions, 45 accessions are of O. nivara, 30 of O. ru pogon, ve of O. glaberrima, three of O. meridionalis, two each of O. barthii, O. glumaepatula, O. sativa f. spontanea and O. longistaminata, and three of O. sativa.

The experiments laid-out in Augmented Block Design (ABD) had ve blocks and spacing of 40 cm \u00d7 40 cm between line to line and plant to plant. The standard cultivation practices were followed for raising a healthy crop of rice germplasm. We utilized morphological descriptors developed by Bioversity International, IRRI and WARDA (2007) for the phenotypic characterization of wild rice germplasm. Observations were recorded on 17 quantitative traits viz., Days to Main Heading (DMH), Days 50% Flowering (DFF), Flag Leaf Length (FLL), Flag Leaf Width (FLW), Plant Height (PHt), Number of Panicle Bearing Tillers (NPBT), Culm Length (CL), Panicle Length (PnL), Number of Primary Branches/Panicle (NPBP), Total Grains per Panicle (TGP), Filled Grains per Panicles (FGP), Spikelet Fertility Percentage (SFP), Awn Length (AnL), Grain Length (GrL), Grain Breadth (GrB), Grain Length Breadth Ratio (GLBR) and Hundred Grain Weight (HGW). The data on ve randomly chosen plants from each accession were recorded at an appropriate stage of plant growth and development (Bioversity International 2007). Genetic diversity analysis with genome-wide microsatellites Pooled genomic DNA was extracted from seedlings of 10 random grains per accession to access allelic polymorphism in 96 CWRs accessions. Rice grains were germinated in folds of germination paper and DNA was extracted from two weeks old seedling using Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) miniprep method (Murray and Thompson 1980). Quality and quantity of extracted DNA was checked in 0.8% agarose gel using standard uncut \u03bb phage DNA as weight marker. DNA samples were diluted in Tris-EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic acid) buffer, after quantitation with NanoDrop spectrophotometer, to obtain 25 ng/\u00b5L conc. Wild rice germplasm accessions were genotyped using a set of 50 microsatellites of diversity panel designed for genotyping of AA-genome Oryza species. The sequences of forward and reverse primers of 50 HvSSRs of diversity panel are available at website https://www.gramene.org/markers/microsat/50_ssr.html. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) ampli cations were carried out in 8.0 \u00b5l reaction mixture containing DNA template 50 ng, GoTaq Green (1X; Promega) containing optimized concentration of PCR buffer, dNTPs and enzyme Taq DNA Polymerase, primers (20 pmol) and DNase free H2O (Promega). PCR reactions were performed in Eppendorf\u2019s Thermocycler using the following thermal cycling parameters: initial DNA denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 53 to 69\u00b0C (depending on the annealing temp. of a primer) for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 30 s and nally a primer extension cycle of 5 min at 72\u00b0C. PCR amplicons were separated in 4% MetaPhor\u2122 agarose pre-stained with Ethidium Bromide and run at 150 V for two hours. The resolved amplicons were visualized under UV light and scored using GeneTools software of Syngene Gel Documentation system. Statistical analyses Morphological data analysis: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and descriptive statistics - mean, range, standard deviation, phenotypic variance (PV), genotypic variance (GV), genotypic coe cient of variation (GCV), phenotypic coe cient of variation (PCV), heritability (H2) and genetic advance as percent of mean (GAM) were estimated for 17 quantitative traits using R software version 3.6.3 (Le et al. 2008). The dendrogram was constructed based on Ward\u2019s distance method using R software. Principal component analysis (PCA), frequency histograms and correlogram based on Pearson\u2019s correlation coe cients were completed using R programme. The diversity estimates based on quantitative traits were derived utilizing Shannon-Weiner index (Shannon and Weaver 1949) with following formula.\nPage 7/41\nWhere n is the number of phenotypic classes for a character, Pi is the relative frequency in the ith class of the jth trait and ln is the natural logarithm of Pi. The extent of diversity was interpreted as < 0.50 value of H\u2032: low diversity, 0.50 to 0.99 value of H\u2032: moderate, 1.00 to 1.49 value of H\u2032: high, and > 1.50 value of H\u2032: very high diversity. The traits, which had H\u2032 >1.50, revealed the existence of great genetic diversity.\nMolecular data analysis\nDice's similarity coe cients were estimated with NTSYSpc software version 2.02h (Rohlf 1998) by using 0\u20131 data matrices generated from microsatellite markers. Dice similarity coe cients were subjected to cluster analysis by Unweighted Paired Group Method of Arithmetic Averages (UPGMA) and Sequential, Agglomerative, Hierarchical and Nested (SAHN) to construct dendrogram. Bootstrapping of dendrogram was done with help of WINBOOT program (Yap and Nelson 1996) with 1000 replications. Population diversity statistics including number of observed alleles (na), number of effective alleles (ne), Shannon information (I), observed homozygosity (Ho), expected heterozygosity (He) and Wright's xation index (Fst) and gene ow (Nm) derived using POPGENE software version 1.32 (Yeh et al.1999). The major allele frequency, gene diversity, heterozygosity and polymorphism information content (PIC) were derived using Darwin software version 6.0.021 (Perrier et al. 2003). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) were completed using GenAlEx software version 6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2012). Population structure was deciphered to assess pattern of genetic structure in CWRs using STRUCTURE software version 2.3.1 (Pritchard et al. 2000). The range of genetic cluster was given from value K = 1 to 10 each with three independent run/iterations with burn-in period of 100000 followed 100000 MCMC replicates (Evanno et al. 2005). Online software Structure Harvester (Earl and von Holdt 2012) was used to nd out \u0394K value.\nResults\nMorphological variation for quantitative traits ANOVA revealed highly signi cant differences for all 17 quantitative traits among wild rice accessions (Supplementary Table\u00a02). A wide range of variability was observed for all the morpho-quantitative traits between different accessions of 10 Oryza species. Descriptive statistics namely, mean, standard deviation, range, PV, GV, GCV, PCV, H2 and GAM were estimated for 17 quantitative traits (Table\u00a02). Medium to high GCV, PCV, and high heritability (broad sense) and GAM were recorded for all the traits. The morphological variability encountered in different quantitative traits is enumerated. \u00a0 \u00a0\nPage 8/41\nTable 2 Descriptive statistics and variability parameters recorded for 17 quantitative traits studied in 10 Oryza species\nTrait Mean SD Range PV GV PCV (%) GCV\n(%)\nH2 GAM\nMin Max\nDMH 116.91 17.57 69.00 158.00 291.57 290.40 14.61 14.58 99.60 30.01\nDFF 122.68 17.18 74.00 166.00 269.17 267.00 13.37 13.32 99.20 27.37\nFLL 30.06 7.70 13.50 54.60 58.71 58.50 25.49 25.45 99.65 52.40\nFLW 1.32 0.41 0.42 2.82 0.17 0.17 31.52 31.50 99.88 64.95\nPHt 106.68 32.97 45.20 196.20 1105.30 1103.73 31.17 31.14 99.85 64.20\nCL 27.46 7.30 12.76 47.62 55.49 55.10 27.12 27.03 99.30 55.56\nNPBT 42.06 17.07 8.40 80.20 283.26 282.53 40.02 39.97 99.74 82.34\nPnL 22.99 3.90 12.80 36.00 16.35 16.13 17.59 17.47 98.67 35.80\nNPBP 9.39 2.37 5.40 17.80 5.43 5.35 24.82 24.63 98.49 50.44\nTGP 117.80 71.68 30.00 449.97 4575.33 4569.92 57.42 57.39 99.88 118.32\nFGP 56.97 53.24 1.80 289.90 2136.14 2134.20 81.12 81.09 99.91 167.20\nSFP 47.43 21.69 0.29 90.09 441.43 440.39 44.30 44.25 99.76 91.17\nAnL 6.14 3.19 0.00 11.10 9.16 9.16 49.30 49.30 100.00 101.70\nGrL 8.15 0.87 5.47 10.10 0.77 0.77 10.77 10.74 99.41 22.10\nGrB 2.42 0.28 1.95 3.02 0.07 0.07 11.19 11.19 100.00 23.08\nGLBR 3.39 0.45 2.37 5.02 0.20 0.20 13.06 13.04 99.74 26.87\nHGW 1.66 0.40 0.70 2.61 0.16 0.16 24.43 24.36 99.42 50.11\nPhenological traits\nSubstantial variation was observed in days to main heading (DMH) with mean of 116.9 days and it ranged from 69 (N22; O. sativa) to 158 days (IC336710; O. ru pogon).

Out of 96 accessions, 12 showed awnless phenotype namely, IC332599 (O. nivara), IC596548, IC596545, IC362061, IC362066 (4 of O. ru pogon), EC133117, EC132675, EC133087 (3 of O. glaberrima), EC784830 (O. longistaminata) and three O. sativa (Nagina22, Pusa44 and Pusa1850). AnL showed low levels of PV and GV but very high estimates of PCV, GCV, H2 and GAM. Grain traits\nGrain length varied from 5.47 mm (IC301735; O. glumaepatula) to 10.10 mm (EC784830; O. longistaminata). GrL showed low estimates of PV and GV but moderate PCV and GCV, and high H2 and GAM. Similarly, GrB ranged from 1.95 mm (IC598103; O. ru pogon) to 3.02 mm (EC132649; O. glaberrima). GrB also revealed the low estimates of PV and GV along with moderate PCV and GCV, and high H2 and GAM. GLBR ranged from 2.37 (IC627921; O. sativa f. spontanea) to 5.02 (EC133087; O. glaberrima). GLBR showed low estimates of PV and GV and moderate PCV and GCV, but high H2 and GAM. HGW ranged from 0.70 g (IC301734; O. o cinalis) to 2.62 g (EC133117; O. glaberrima). This trait revealed very low estimates of PV and GV along with high PCV and GCV and high H2 and GAM.\nThe diversity index (H\u2032) also con rmed the presence of high level of variability in quantitative traits for both within O. nivara (H\u2032=1.09) and O. ru pogon (H\u2032=1.12) and between species (H\u2032=1.31) (Table\u00a03). \u00a0 \u00a0\nPage 10/41\nFour quantitative traits namely, DMH, DFF, PHt, NPBT showed very high levels of morphological variations, while nine traits viz., FLL, FLW, CL, TGP, AnL, GLBR, FGP, SPP and HGW revealed high variation among the accessions. However, four traits namely, PnL, NPBP, GrL and GrB displayed moderate level of variation. Frequency distribution of phenotypic traits Frequency histograms displayed high level of phenotypic variations for all 17 quantitative traits studied in Oryza species (Fig.\u00a01). The values for three checks namely Pusa44, Pusa1850 and Nagina22 are shown by lines of green, blue and red colours, respectively and re ected the variability present in checks vis-a-vis wild rice accessions of CWRs of AA-genome species for 17 quantitative traits. Principal component analysis PCA showed that the rst ve principal components (PCs) with Eigen value of >1.0 revealed cumulative variance of 79.22% (Supplementary Table 3). For PC1, the main contributing traits were TGP, NPBP, FLW, PnL, PHt, FGP, FLL\nPage 11/41\nand AnL and accounted for 27.92% of total variability. The PC2 explained 19.06% total variation and major contributing traits were SFP, HGW, FGP, NPBT and grain length. However, PC3 explained 13.80% variability. In PC3, main traits were DMH, DFF, GrL and GLBR. PC4 revealed that GrB and GLBR were the major contributing traits for the total variation of 10.252%. PC5 accounted for 8.19% of total variability and traits contributed the most were CL, GrL, AnL and FLL. The interactions among the traits and with accessions are shown in PCA biplot showing rst two principal components (Fig. 1). Association between quantitative traits Correlogram was constructed representing correlation coe cients among the component traits (Fig.\u00a03). Among the quantitative traits related to phenology, plant morphology and yield, days to main tiller heading (DMH) showed very strong positive association with DFF (r = 0.99). DMH also associated positively with NPB (0.25) and FLW (0.30) but negatively associated with SFP (\u2212 0.41). Similarly, DFF also positively associated with NPB (0.24) and FLW (0.31), however, it was negatively associated with SFP (-0.44). Plant height showed signi cant positive correlation with CL (0.57), PnL (0.55), FLW (0.56), FLL (0.55), TGP (0.43) and NPB (0.42). Similarly, panicle length (PnL) also showed strong positive association with CL (0.45), FLW (0.65), FLL (0.46), TGP (0.59) and NPB (0.55). FLW showed strong positive association with TGP (0.71), NPB (0.58), FGP (0.34) and FLL (0.39). However, this trait was negatively correlated with AnL (r = \u2212 0.43). FLL positively associated with CL (0.38), TGP (0.38), NPB (0.46) and FGP (0.33). Number of panicle bearing tillers (NPBT) showed positive correlation with awn length (0.39) and DFF (0.29), but negatively correlated with FGP (-0.39) and SFP (-0.36). NPB showed very strong positive correlation with TGP (0.76) and FGP (0.69), but negatively associated with AnL (-0.58). TGP showed signi cant and positive correlation with FGP (0.72) and negative association with AnL (-0.59) and NPBT (\u2212 0.28). Filled grains/panicle (FGP) had strong positive correlation with SFP (0.71) and negative association with AnL (-0.58) and NPBT (-0.39). Grain length (GrL) positively associated with GLBR (0.60), HGW (0.64), GrB (0.27) and SFP (0.27). GrB showed positive correlation with HGW (0.52) and SFP (0.27), but strong negative correlation with GLBR (-0.60). HGW revealed signi cantly positive association with SFP (0.47) and FGP (0.28), but negatively associated with NPBT (-0.27).

The primer-pair for SSR RM334, ampli ed the highest number of alleles (26) closely followed by SSR loci RM259 (24) and RM1 and RM 307 each amplifying 22 alleles. However, lowest alleles (4) ampli ed in SSR locus RM 338 followed by SSR loci RM455 (7) and RM495 (8). A total number of 5115 amplicons obtained with mean values of 113.67 amplicons per primer. Molecular analysis of CWRs revealed that two and three alleles ampli ed at many SSR loci (Table\u00a04). We detected 95 unique and 190 rare alleles ampli ed in 96 accessions CWRs with mean of 2.11 and 4.22 alleles per locus, respectively (Table\u00a04). The highest numbers of unique alleles observed in SSR locus RM334 (6) followed by RM154, RM307 and RM162 with each amplifying ve unique alleles. SSR locus RM259 ampli ed the highest number (10) of rare alleles followed by SSR loci RM334 (9) and RM514, RM307and RM287 each amplifying eight alleles. Multiple alleles were ampli ed in CWRs accessions. SSR locus RM259 revealed the presence of the maximum numbers of 2-alleles in 57 accessions followed by SSR loci RM1 and RM307 had 2- alleles in 41 and 37 accessions, respectively. PIC value ranged from 0.676 to 0.931. The primer RM507 ampli ed 10 total alleles with the least PIC value of 0.676. The highest PIC (0.931) observed in RM334 closely followed by RM536 (0.912), RM 431 (0.911) and RM5 (0.902). The high PIC (0.833) indicates the presence of high level of DNA polymorphism in accessions CWRs. Thus, SSR markers used in the study are hypervariable and very useful for diversity analysis. Genetic inter-relationship in wild rice germplasm Genetic similarity between 96 accessions of Oryza species estimated using Dice\u2032s similarity coe cients. The similarity coe cients varied from 0.00 to 0.891 with a mean value 0.132. The highest similarity (0.891) observed\nPage 16/41\nbetween two accessions of O. glumaepatula namely, WR814 (IC301735) and WR815 (IC301738), which closely followed by three pairs of O. nivara accessions viz., WR775 (IC596548) and WR756 (IC330653), WR734 (IC283152) and WR736 (IC283181), and WR735 (IC283155) and WR736 (IC283181). The zero similarity coe cients were observed between six pairs of accessions namely, WR735 (IC283155; O. nivara) and WR817 (EC384101; O. barthii), WR745 (IC283198; O. nivara) and WR812 (EC384083; O. meridionalis), WR748 (IC283189; O. nivara) and WR762 (IC272981; O. nivara), WR756 (IC330653; O. nivara) and WR799 (IC336703; O. ru pogon), WR760 (IC330616; O. nivara) and WR814 (IC301735; O. glumaepatula), and WR764 (IC272986; O. nivara) and WR820 (IC627921; O. sativa f. spontanea). All the alleles showed DNA polymorphism between the pairs of above mentioned accessions. However, other lowest similarity coe cient (0.016) observed between WR796 (IC336687; O. ru pogon) and WR813 (EC384124; O. meridionalis) followed by accessions WR727 (IC283158; O. nivara) and WR785 (IC598103; O. ru pogon) (0.017), WR776 (IC381929; O. ru pogon) and WR813 (EC384124; O. meridionalis) (0.017), WR756 (IC330653; O. nivara) and WR796 (IC381929; O. ru pogon) (0.018), and WR732 (IC283180; O. nivara ) and WR779 (IC336675; O. ru pogon) (0.018).\nUPGMA dendrogram separated 96 accessions of Oryza species at 0.10 similarities and grouped all the accessions into four clusters (Fig.\u00a06). Clusters-I included 34 accessions and had three subclusters (a-c). Subcluster-I:a grouped 12 accessions, which included three O. ru pogon accessions (IC330655, IC598078, IC330666) and 9 accessions of O. nivara. However, subcluster-I:b-c included 17 and ve accessions of O. nivara, respectively. Thus, cluster-I consisted of 31 accessions of O. nivara and three accessions of O. ru pogon. Cluster-II also grouped 34 accessions in two subclusters (a-b). The subcluster-II:a grouped 15 accessions belonging to O. glaberrima (IC556030), O. sativa f. spontanea (IC627921, IC627922), O. longistaminata (EC133275, EC784830), O. sativa (Pusa44, Pusa1850 and Nagina22) and 7 accessions of O. ru pogon. However, subcluster-II:b grouped 19 accessions, all of O. ru pogon. Thus in cluster-II, most of the accessions (26) belongs to O. ru pogon. ClusterIII:a,b included 14 accessions of O. nivara from West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha. Cluster-IV:a,b composed of 14 accessions mainly of ve species of AA-genome namely, O. glumaepatula (IC301735, IC301738), O. barthii (IC380147, EC384101), O. meridionalis (IC556056, EC384083, EC384124), O. glaberrima (EC132649, EC133117, EC132675, EC133087), O. ru pogon (IC336675) and O. o cinalis (IC301734 and EC384063).\u00a0 Genetic divergence in populations of wild rice germplasm Summary statistics of gene diversity were estimated using 45 genome-wide SSR loci in 96 accessions of Oryza species (Table\u00a05). The observed number of alleles (na) varied from 4.0 (RM338) to 26.0 (RM334) with an average of 15.24 alleles per locus. The effective numbers of alleles (ne) were lower than the observed alleles. The highest number (17.26) of effective alleles detected at SSR locus RM334, whereas the minimum \u2018ne\u2019 (3.24) observed at RM338 with mean \u2018ne\u2019 were 8.97 alleles per locus.\n\u00a0\nTable 5.

The SSR markers with high ne also revealed high values of the Shannon's diversity index. Frequency of major alleles ranged from 0.10 (RM334) to 0.43 (RM338) with mean value of 0.21. The observed homozygosity varied from 0.35 (RM259) to 1.00 (WR455, RM133, RM338) with the mean value of 0.14; while the observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.00 (WR455, RM133, RM338) to 0.65 (RM259) with the mean of 0.14. Gene diversity varied from 0.69 (RM338) to 0.94 (RM334) with an average of 0.87. Similarly, the average heterozygosity ranged from 0.37 (RM338) to 0.87 (RM259) with an average of 0.73. The deviation from Hardy\u2013Weinberg\u2019s prediction was calculated using Wright\u2032s xation index. The moderate rate of genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.14) was found in wild rice accessions. For individual SSR locus, it ranged from 0.05 (RM307) to 0.49 (RM338). The high amount of gene ow (av. 1.53) observed at most of the microsatellite loci, which varied from 0.26 (RM338) to 4.78 (RM307). The genetic identity and distance between four populations of 96 accessions of 10 Oryza species were derived using Nei's unbiased measures (Table 6). The highest genetic identity was observed between population 2 and 3 (0.638). The highest genetic distance observed between population 1 and 4 (1.233) followed by population 1 and 2 (1.095). UPGMA dendrogram was constructed based on Nei's unbiased genetic distance (Fig. 7). Among the\nPage 19/41\nfour populations, population 2 and 3 were genetically close to each other and the population 1 and 4 were genetically the most distant than the other populations.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Population structure of wild rice germplasm Population structure of 96 accessions of 10 Oryza species was inferred by using data of 45 SSR loci. The peak of log likelihood (\u2206K) was at K=4 (Fig. 8) suggesting four populations. The population-1, 2, 3and 4 consisted of 12, 17, 53, 14 accessions, respectively (Fig. 9). The population-1 comprising of 12 accessions of O. nivara, is similar to cluster-III of Dice\u2032s similarity dendrogram except two accessions, IC282993 and IC257161. Eight accessions of population-1 shared 1.0 to 45.0% alleles from other populations. Two O. nivara accessions namely, IC330654 and IC330610 shared 22 and 23% alleles with population-2. Similarly, accession IC272986 shared 1.0% alleles with the accessions of population-2 and 44.0% alleles with the accessions of population-3.\nThe population-2 comprised of 17 O. nivara accessions, which were also included in cluster-I of Dice\u2032s similarity dendrogram. Of the 17 accessions, 14 were identical to subcluster-I:b and three accessions (IC283156, IC283158 and IC598110) grouped in subcluster-I:a. However, in population-2, 10 accessions shared alleles from 0.5 to 47.0% with other populations. Three accessions IC283176, IC282989 and IC283149, shared 3.0, 5.0 and 16.0% alleles, respectively, with other populations; whereas six accessions namely, IC336693, IC283160, IC336689, IC283158, IC283156 and IC598110 shared 35, 36, 40, 45, 46 and 48% alleles, respectively, mainly with population-3. Population-3 consisted of 53 accessions including 30 O. ru pogon, 16 O. nivara, three checks (Nagina22, Pusa44 and Pusa1850), one O. glaberrima (IC556030), two O. longistaminata (EC133275, EC784830) and one O. sativa f. spontanea (IC627922). In this population, 31 accessions shared alleles, ranging from 1.0 to 41.0% with accessions of other populations.\nThe population-4 grouped 14 accessions, four O. glaberrima (EC132649, EC133117, EC132675 and EC133087), three O. meridionalis (IC556056, EC384083 and EC384124), two O. glumaepatula (IC301735 and IC301738), two O. barthii (IC380147, EC384101), two O. o cinalis (IC301734, EC384063) and one O. sativa f. spontanea (IC627921). The accessions of population-4 are similar to cluster-IV of UPGMA dendrogram except accession (IC336703), in place of which accession IC627921 was included. Population-4 included 7 accessions which shared alleles from other populations ranging from 1.0 to 25.0%. Accessions IC301734, EC384063, EC384083 and\nPage 20/41\nEC132649 shared 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 and 12.0% alleles with three populations. However, three accessions namely, IC627921, IC556056 and IC380147 shared 15.0, 16.0 and 25% alleles, respectively, with other populations.\nAnalysis of molecular variation in wild rice germplasm\nAnalysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) for 96 accessions of Oryza species was performed based on four population data (Table 7). AMOVA revealed 11.0% variation among the populations, whereas 70.0% variation was recorded among genotypes and 19.0% variation within genotypes (Fig. 10a). The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed 13.10% cumulative variation from rst three axes of coordinates, each axis 1, 2 and 3 individually contributing 5.17, 4.28 and 3.65% variance, respectively. First two components accounted for 9.45% of total genetic variation. The pattern of variance of four populations depicted in PCoA plot (Fig. 10b) with population-3 intermixed with other three populations. AMOVA of all 45 O. nivara accessions, analysed based on geographic locations of four states, revealed high level of molecular variance among genotypes (64%) and PCoA plot displayed that population 2 consisted of accessions from West Bengal is genetically distant from other three populations (Fig. 10c, d). However, within genotype molecular variance was much higher in O. ru pogon (30%) (Fig. 10e) compared to O. nivara accessions (15%). PCoA plots showed admixtures between four geographically different populations of O. ru pogon (Fig. 10f).\u00a0 \u00a0\nTable 7 AMOVA of molecular diversity studied in 96 accessions of Oryza spp. using 45 SSR markers.\nSource of variation D.F.

The wild species of Oryza are reservoir of useful genes for resistance to biotic, abiotic stress and yield-related traits. Traditional and improved cultivars in rice have lost their stress tolerance genes and allelic polymorphism during the course of development and subsequent selection for uniformity by the farmers. Hence, there is a need for genetic enhancement of germplasm through pre-breeding and the conservation of germplasm of landraces and CWRs. Assessment of genetic diversity and relationships between and within crop species and their wild relatives is essential for characterization, conservation and utilization of CWRs in the breeding programmes (Volk et al. 2020). Hence the present study is focused on morphological and molecular analyses of CWRs of rice of AAgenome species.\u00a0\nMorphological characterization of wild rice germplasm\nAccurate characterization and organization of diversity would help to frame breeding strategies and to facilitate appropriate choices for germplasm conservation (Khush and Virk 2000). Traditionally, identi cation and\nPage 21/41\nclassi cation of species have been done mainly through morphological characterization (Vaughan and Morishima 2003). Qualitative and quantitative traits\u00a0have been used for identi cation, characterization and classi cation of wild species germplasm (Singh et al. 2018; Tiwari et al. 2020; Sathishkumar et al. 2021). However,\u00a0characterization of species diversity should help to decode their dynamic relationship and identi cation of suitable breeding material for rice improvement (Brar and Khush 2018).\u00a0Awning, seed shattering and dormancy are the key traits present in rice CWRs (Vaughan et al. 2008; Xu and Sun. 2021; Ishikawa et al. 2022).\u00a0We observed high level of phenotypic variability for all quantitative traits. The descriptive statistics also revealed huge variation for all 17 quantitative traits in the wild rice accessions. PCV and GCV ranged from medium to high. High heritability (broad sense) and genetic advance recorded for all the traits. Earlier studies have also reported the descriptive statistics of CWRs, and crosses between cultivated rice and O. ru pogon accessions, wherein low to high PCV and GCV, and high heritability and genetic advance were obtained (Chouhan et al. 2014; Roy and Shil 2020).\nThe phenological traits like DMH and DFF showed extensive variation in rice CWRs of AA-genome. DMH varied from 69 to 158 days with an average of 116 days, whereas DFF varied from 74 to 166 days with an average of 122 days. In an earlier study, Samal et al. (2018) reported that DFF in O. ru pogon populations varied from 101 to 159 days with an average of 140 days, while it ranged from 101 to 136 days in O. nivara. Tiwari et al. (2020) also found DMH varying from 65 to 117 days with an average of 86 days and DFF from 71 to 127 days with an average of 91 days in wild rice accessions collected from different ecological zones of India. Khan et al. (2020) reported maximum DFF for O. o cinalis. Above studies, reveal that O. o cinalis species showed late owering behaviour and large variation for DMH and DFF exists in the germplasm. However, minor variations in the range of phenological traits ought to be there due to differences in genetics and environmental conditions. In our study, plant architecture traits namely FLL (13.5 \u2013 54.6 cm), FFW (0.42 \u2013 2.82 cm), PHt (45.2 \u2013 196.2 cm) and CL (12.76 \u2013 47.62 cm) showed high amount of morphological variation for both within and between species. The mean values of plant architectural traits were higher when compared to other studies by Sandamal et al (2018), Tiwari et al (2020) and Sandamal et al (2021).\u00a0\u00a0\nPanicle traits are important yield contributing traits which showed enormous amount of variation, e.g. NPBT (8.40 \u2013 80.20), PnL (12.80 \u2013 36.00 cm), NPB (5.40 \u2013 17.80), TGP (30 \u2013 550), FGP (1.8 \u2013 290.0) and SFP (0.3 \u2013 90.1) greatly varied. Similarly, Singh et al (2013) assessed phenotypic diversity in O. nivara and O. ru pogon populations and found high diversity among the traits, namely productive tillers (2.5\u20138.2), panicle length (17.7\u2013 28.5 cm), grains per panicle (54.6\u2013267.3), lled grains (19.1\u2013231.9) and spikelet fertility (23.4\u201386.8%). The grain traits such as AnL (0.0 \u201311.1 cm), GrL (5.47\u201310.10 mm), GrB (1.95\u20133.02 mm), GLBR (2.37\u20135.02) and HGW (0.70\u20132.62 g) displayed huge phenotypic variations in current study. Similarly, Samal et al (2018) detected high level of phenotypic variation in grain traits between O. nivara and O. ru pogon accessions. O. nivara accessions produced short bold to medium grain type with grain length (4.27\u20139.46 mm), grain breadth (1.99\u20133.25 mm) and GLBR (2.03\u20134.08). The accessions of O. ru pogon had medium to long slender grain with GrL (7.08\u20139.26 mm), GrB (1.76\u20132.94 mm) and GLBR (2.70\u20134.68). Tiwari et al (2020) also reported the diverse range for various grain traits viz., AnL (0.0\u201310.29 cm), GrL (4.02\u201311.20 mm), GrB (1.50\u20132.84 mm), GLBR (2.12\u20136.29) and HGW (0.73\u2013 2.78) and supports our ndings of high variation in the grain characteristics of O. nivara and O. ru pogon accessions. Similar morphological variations in the grain traits of wild rice species were observed by Juliano et al (1998), Arrieta-Espinoza et al (2005), Dong et al (2010), Banaticla-Hilario\u00a0et al (2013a) and Sandamal et al (2018).\u00a0In an analysis of agro-morphological traits of O. longistaminata populations from four regions of\nPage 22/41\nTanzania, Mangosongo et al.\u00a0(2019) detected high level of genetic variation in both within and among the populations for 10 quantitative traits except grain length. \u00a0\nBanaticla-Hilario et al. (2013a) studied ecogeographic variation in Asian wild rice species (O. nivara\u00a0and O. ru pogon) using 22 quantitative traits.\u00a0Cluster analysis clearly separated the two sympatric populations of O. ru pogon and O. nivara. The functional trait diversity analysed using 11 quantitative traits in ve Oryza species viz., O. nivara, O. ru pogon, O. eichingeri, O. rhizomatis\u00a0and O. granulata in Sri Lanka showed huge variation and distinguished all the species (Sandamal et al.\u00a02021). PHt, PnL, CL and HGW showed high differences between O. nivara and O. ru pogon\u00a0accessions. Our results on morphological traits broadly corroborate with Banaticla-Hilario et\u00a0al (2013a), Singh et al (2013, 2018), Samal et al (2018), Tiwari et al (2020) and Sandamal et al (2021) for genetic variability within and between species of AA-genome. However, the phenotypic differences observed between and within Oryza\u00a0species might be due to niche adaptation, breeding system and varied genetic make-up of the populations.\u00a0\nMultivariate analysis revealed high amount of genetic variation within and between species of wild rice germplasm accessions. First ve PCs accounted for 79.22 per cent variation.\u00a0PC1 had contribution from the traits namely, TGP, NPBP, FLW, PnL, PHt, FGP and FLL with 27.92% variance. Similar ndings were also reported by Arrieta-Espinoza et al (2005) and Chouhan et al (2014). The traits, namely SFP, HGW, FGP, NPBT and GrL accounted for 19.06% variation in PC2. Arrieta-Espinoza et al (2005) studied morphological variation in CWRs, varieties and weedy types using 27 phenotypic traits using multivariate analysis. They detected 66.25% variation from rst three PCs. Panicle and grain traits are responsible for 36.21% variation in rst PC. PC2 accounted for 18.90% variation which clearly separates weedy morphotypes from other AA-genome species. The plants of tetraploid genome (CCDD; O. grandiglumis and O. latifolia) were taller, high seed shattering, more exsertion of panicle and wide ag-leaf width than the diploid (AA; O. sativa, O. glaberrima, O. glumaepatula and O. ru pogon) species, which clearly separate diploid from tetraploid species. In our study, O. o cinalis\u00a0the CC genome species exhibited high seed shattering, wide ag-leaf angle and more exsertion of panicle.\u00a0\nIn our study the yield contributing traits like SFP, HGW, FGP and GrL had contributed 19.09 % variance to total variability of PC2. The remaining variability of 13.80%, 10.25%, 8.19% consolidated in PC3, PC4 and PC5, respectively, by phenological and yield-related traits, namely DMH, DFF, CL, AnL, FLL, GrL, GrB and GLBR. Patel et al (2022) had also reported that phenological and yield-related traits such as DFF, NPBT, PHt, PnL, days to maturity, GLBR, HGW and yield/ plant contribute phenotypic diversity in indigenous rice germplasm. Basavaraj et al (2022) have reported that PHt, NPBT, PnL, spikelet per panicle, spikelet fertility, seed weight and grain yield/plant are the major contributors to the variation of O.\u00a0ru pogon\u00a0introgression lines.\u00a0\nAssociations between quantitative traits\nDeciphering of genetic relationship between different traits is vital for direct or indirect selection. HGW showed positive correlation with GrL, GrB, SFP, FGP and NPBP. The phenological traits such as DMH revealed highly signi cant and positive correlation with DFF. Similar results were also obtained by Mangosongo et al (2019), Kakar et al (2021) and Basavaraj et al (2022) in cultivated and wild rice germplasm. In our study, awn length showed strong negative association with most of the yield-related traits such as TGP, NPBP, FGP, FLW and SFP. Several authors also reported that development of awns in rice had a negative impact on the grain yield (Luo et al. 2013; Gu et al. 2015; Jin et al. 2016).\u00a0\nPage 23/41\nClustering and genetic inter-relationships\u00a0\nCluster analysis revealed the grouping of wild rice accessions into three major clusters. Cluster-I had majority of exotic Oryza species of AA-genome along with the checks (O. sativa). Cluster-II grouped the highest number of accessions including majority of O. nivara and O. ru pogon. Cluster-III included only two accessions of O. o cinalis. Similar type of clustering was obtained based on 28 morphological traits by Tiwari et al (2020) in CWRs. Mangosongo et al (2019)\u00a0reported that grouping of O. longistaminata\u00a0accessions was not based on their geographical origin and clustering of different species of AA-genome into same cluster was due to similar morphological traits and ancestral relationship. Similarly, many studies reported the existence of genetic divergence in wild rice species based on phenotypic traits and found high genetic differences between species (Juliano et al. 1998; Dong et al. 2010; Banaticla-Hilario et al. 2013a; Liu et al. 2015). The results showed that the morphological traits clearly demarcate the Oryza species of different genome types.\u00a0\nDNA polymorphism and allelic richness in wild rice germplasm\nDNA markers help us to understand the extent of genetic variability that exists at nucleotide level among landraces, varieties and wild rice accessions which can be exploited in rice breeding programmes. We detected 676 alleles with 45 hypervariable genome-wide SSR markers. High numbers of alleles (15.24) with broad range, 4.0 to 26.0 alleles per SSR locus, indicate the presence of allelic richness in the rice germplasm of CWRs. We obtained more alleles than Samal et al (2018), who detected 144 alleles with mean of 4.0 alleles using 36 SSR markers in 238 wild rice accessions from Odisha and West Bengal. The detection of lower alleles in the study might be due to the fact that they separated SSR amplicons in lower concentration of agarose (2.5%) and have analysed different sets of SSR loci and wild rice accessions. Similarly, Singh et al (2016) reported lower alleles than the present investigation. They identi ed 106 alleles with mean of 4.26 alleles per locus in the analysis of 25 SSR loci in 132 O. nivara and O. ru pogon accessions collected from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\u00a0\nBanaticla-Hilario et al (2013b)\u00a0studied allelic polymorphism in 119 accessions of O. nivara\u00a0and O. ru pogon\u00a0using 29 SSR loci obtained from Oryza high diversity panel of Gramene portal. SSR markers used by them were similar to the SSR markers used in the current study. They detected 417 alleles, which varied from 3.0 (RM455) to 32.0 (RM316) with an average of 14.0 allele per locus, a value at par with our study. The na per locus was higher in current study than detected in O. longistaminata accessions (na = 7.13 by Melaku et al (2013). Of the total ampli ed alleles, 28.1% alleles were identi ed as rare alleles in our study, a value much higher than detected (20% rare alleles) by Samal et al (2018). However, rare alleles observed by Banaticla-Hilario et al (2013b) were 62%, a value much higher than the rare alleles observed in our present study. Oryza accessions revealed 2.31Shannon's information index (I), indicating high level of diversity than reported (I = 0.19) by Zhang et al (2022). The HvSSR markers used in our study showed high resolving power. PIC ranged from 0.676 (RM507) to 0.931 (RM334) and 36 out of 45 markers had PIC value of more than 0.800. PIC value (0.833) obtained in our study was higher than the PIC values reported earlier in wild rice collections from Indo-Gangetic plains of India (0.790) by Singh et al (2013) and eastern regions of India (0.703) by Swain et al (2017).\u00a0\nIn the present study, the accessions clustered in different principal co-ordinates are closely related to structure population. The rst two co-ordinates explained 5.17 and 4.28 per cent of molecular variance. On the contrary, Singh et al (2016) observed 35.53% and 17.80% variation from rst two co-ordinates. Banaticla-Hilario et al (2013b) explained 21.80% and 19.10% variation from rst two co-ordinates of O. nivara and O. ru pogon accessions. Choudhury et al (2014) reported 18.41% and 18.04% variation from rst two co-ordinates of rice\nPage 24/41\ngermplasm from North-Eastern regions of India. Though there was extensive allele sharing between the populations, the AMOVA of Oryza accessions showed 11.0% variation among populations, 70.0% variation among genotypes and 19.0% variation within genotypes. Similarly, Samal et al (2018) reported 21.0% variation between populations of O. ru pogon\u00a0and O. nivara\u00a0and Singh et al (2016) observed 12.0% variation existed among the populations of O. nivara and O. ru pogon.\u00a0Sandamal et al (2018) reported 12.3% variation between the accessions of O. nivara and O. ru pogon\u00a0species from\u00a0Sri Lanka. The results revealed that diversity existed among O. nivara\u00a0accessions\u00a0is greater than O. ru pogon\u00a0accessions. Similar results were also reported by Samal et al (2018) and Sandamal et al (2018).\u00a0\nPopulation structure and genetic differentiation\u00a0\nBayesian model-based structure analysis revealed four populations\u00a0among\u00a096\u00a0Oryza accessions. The population1 consisted of O. nivara accessions from West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh and population-2 had O. nivara accessions from Odisha. However, population-3 had admixture of O. nivara and O. ru pogon accessions, whereas population-4 included check varieties of O. sativa ssp. indica along with accessions of exotic Oryza AA-genome species. The high level of gene ow occurred among the accessions of sativa-nivara-ru pogon complex and between other AA-genome species. The allele sharing between the accessions was high indicating that a close genetic ancestral relationship exists between the AA-genome species. The high gene ow between accessions of AA-genome species indicates sharing of a common ancestor during evolution. The results of structure analysis performed by earlier researchers in CWRs of rice utilizing microsatellite markers (Banaticla-Hilario et al. 2013b; Naredo et al. 2017; Samal et al. 2018) corroborates our ndings. Banaticla-Hilario et al (2013b) reported more than 50% of allele sharing between O. ru pogon\u00a0and O. nivara\u00a0populations.\u00a0However,\u00a0Samal et al (2018)\u00a0reported more than 50% allele sharing between O. ru pogon\u00a0and O. nivara population at K=2.\u00a0However, Sandamal et al (2018) studied population structure of O. ru pogon\u00a0and O. nivara\u00a0accessions of\u00a0Sri Lanka.\u00a0The allele frequency distribution showed divergence from K=2 to 12 and species grouped into different populations.\u00a0The\u00a0structure analysis has been employed frequently for studying population structure in wild rices by various researchers (Singh et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2016; Melaku et al. 2019; Labarosa et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2022). In our study, we found presence of admixture in the entire population which is similar to the report of Vaughan et al (2008a). The availability of wild accessions with unique and rare alleles will be extremely valuable for rice breeding programmes.\u00a0\nThe highest genetic identity was observed between subpopulation 1 and 4 because of non-overlapping of species between the subpopulations. The least genetic distance found between subpopulations 2 and 3. The least genetic distance between the populations was due to sharing of common alleles and high gene ow between the two populations. Genetic and geographic distance between two populations was higher due to presence of large number of unique alleles between the two populations. Banaticla-Hilario et al (2013b) studied the genetic differentiation of O. nivara\u00a0and O. ru pogon and found 10% variation\u00a0among populations and found high level of genetic differentiation between non-sympatric populations. In our study, the gene diversity revealed by expected heterozygosity (He=0.87) was higher than observed in O. nivara\u00a0and O. ru pogon accessions (He=0.524) from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (Singh et al. 2016) and O. longistaminata\u00a0accessions (He=0.420) from Ethiopia (Melaku et al. 2019). However, Banaticla-Hilario et al (2013b) reported that\u00a0O. nivara (He = 0.67) exhibits slightly lower diversity and greater population differentiation than O. ru pogon (He = 0.70).\u00a0The Fst value ranged from 0.05 (RM307) to 0.49 (RM338) with mean of 0.14 indicating moderate level of genetic differentiation among the accessions of CWRs. The gene ow varied from 0.26 (RM338) to 4.78 (RM307) with mean value 1.53 indicating\nPage 25/41\nhigh gene ow among the Oryza accessions. The gene diversity of wild rice species assayed by previous researchers revealed the presence of moderate to high diversity in the CWRs of rice (Zhou et al. 2003; Juneja et al. 2006; Karasawa et al. 2007; Ram et al. 2007; Mangosongo et al. 2020).\nGenetic similarity and inter-relationship\u00a0\nDice's similarity coe cients of Oryza species ranged from 0.000 to 0.891 with mean of 0.132. The highest similarity coe cient (0.891) observed between O. glumaepatula\u00a0accessions IC301735) and IC301738. These O. glumaepatula\u00a0accessions are collections from Central America which had similar\u00a0morphological features. Swain et al (2017) observed the highest similarity coe cients (0.775) between O. nivara accessions, while Brondani et al (2005) reported the highest genetic similarity between O. glumaepatula populations (0.690). UPGMA dendrogram grouped the Oryza accessions into four major clusters at 0.10 similarity coe cient. However, Banaticla-Hilario et al (2013b) reported grouping of wild rice accessions (O. nivara, O. ru pogon and O. meridionalis)\u00a0into three major clusters. The Oryza species were not clearly grouped into different clusters due to large extent of allele sharing between non-sympatric species, common ancestry and high gene ow. Swain et al (2017) reported grouping of accessions into two major clusters, wherein O. nivara accessions from Midnapur (West Bengal) grouped in the separate cluster and other accessions of O. nivara, O. ru pogon\u00a0and cultivated species in another cluster. Similarly, many investigations on genetic divergence and inter-relationships in wild rice species were conducted using SSR markers and found high genetic diversity between and within species (Ren et al. 2003; Pusadee et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2015; Samal et al. 2018; Zhou et al. 2023).\nConclusions Wild genetic resources are the rich source of genes for the trait improvement of cultivated rice varieties. The morphological and molecular characterization of CWRs is a prerequisite for their utilization in trait-speci c breeding programmes. Huge\u00a0variability for morphological traits and SSR loci was detected in the germplasm accessions of CWRs of rice. The diversity index also revealed high diversity in\u00a0O. nivara and O. ru pogon\u00a0accessions. Promising accessions for high panicle bearing tillers (IC330668; O. ru pogon), high spikelet fertility (IC556030; O. glaberrima),\u00a0long grains (EC784830; O. longistaminata), broad grains\u00a0(EC132649; O. glaberrima) and high GLBR (EC133087; O. glaberrima) were identi ed. High molecular variation along with phenotypic diversity revealed in the accessions of the progenitor species of cultivated Asian rice could be utilized for crop improvement programmes. Therefore, the present study forms a platform to utilize the morpho-genetic variation of wild species of rice to develop the climate resilient high yielding rice varieties in future.\nDeclarations Supplementary data les\nThe supplementary data are available as Supplementary Tables S1, 2 and 3 online.\nAuthor contribution\u00a0\nMahesh C.
