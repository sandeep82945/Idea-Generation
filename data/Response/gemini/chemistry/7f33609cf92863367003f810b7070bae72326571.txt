1. **Investigate the role of lutein and its isomers in human health.** Lutein is a carotenoid that is found in high concentrations in the macula of the eye. It has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and it may play a role in protecting against age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, more research is needed to determine the specific role of lutein and its isomers in human health.
2. **Develop new methods for extracting and purifying lutein and its isomers.** Lutein is a valuable compound with a wide range of potential applications. However, current methods for extracting and purifying lutein are inefficient and expensive. New methods are needed to make lutein more accessible and affordable.
3. **Explore the use of lutein and its isomers in food and beverage products.** Lutein is a natural colorant that can be used to enhance the appearance of food and beverage products. It also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may make it a valuable addition to functional foods and beverages.
4. **Investigate the use of lutein and its isomers in cosmetics and personal care products.** Lutein has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may make it a valuable ingredient in cosmetics and personal care products. It could be used to protect the skin from damage caused by UV radiation and pollution, and it may also help to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.
5. **Develop new analytical methods for detecting and quantifying lutein and its isomers.** Lutein is a complex compound that can exist in a variety of different forms. New analytical methods are needed to accurately detect and quantify lutein and its isomers in different matrices, such as food, beverages, and biological samples.
