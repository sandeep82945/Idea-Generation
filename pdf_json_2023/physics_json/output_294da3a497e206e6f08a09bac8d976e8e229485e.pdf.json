E-mail:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nsubdomain IIIA).17,18 At the same time, azo dyes can bind reversibly and effectively with HSA, which can regulate the effective concentration of limiting toxicity.19,20 The molecular recognition between the two molecules also affects the active function of biomolecules.3,21 Therefore, a careful investigation of the HSA and MY binding is essential to better clarify the colorant\u2013protein interaction.\nThe interaction between azo dyes (such as citrus red 2 and tartrazine) and HSA has been thoroughly studied, providing another idea for the safety evaluation of azo dyes.14,22 The purpose of the current study was to look at how HSA and MY interact under simulated physiological conditions in vitro through multispectral, computer simulation, and other methods. The impact of this interaction on the structure and function of physiologically important proteins was also evaluated through uorescence spectroscopy to identify the binding mechanism, the basic thermodynamic parameters, and binding related force.23\u201326 The quenching mechanism of the system was further discussed by uorescence-lifetime measurements.

To investigate how various small-molecule ligands and proteins interact, molecular uorescence spectroscopy may be employed efficiently and dependably. This method can be used to obtain specic information about the changes in biophysical properties caused by binding proteins, such as the type of quenching and binding ability. Fluorescence quenching is caused by changes in the microenvironment of chromophores, and results can be obtained by changes in protein uorescence\nFig. 1 (A) Fluorescence spectra of HSA\u2013MY system; (B) Stern\u2013Volmer c lifetime curve of the HSA\u2013MY system; (D) double logarithmic plot of fluor\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The shi of a uorophore from its excited state to its ground state is known as dynamic quenching caused by short-term intermolecular collision between protein and quench agent. Static quenching is the generation of a new binding quench compound. With rising temperature, the static quenching constant (Ksv) decreases and is inversely proportional to the diffusion frequency.27\nBased on the above, the analysis is made as follows. Aer adding MY, the uorescence was quenched (Fig. 1A). Increasing MY concentration caused a noticeable blue shi and a steady decrease in the emission intensity of HSA, that could be caused by the environment around Trp and Tyr becoming more hydrophobic. These ndings demonstrated that MY interacted with HSA and reduced its inherent uorescence. The connection between the quenching constant and temperature, which was inversely proportional to temperature for static quenching, may be used to distinguish between the two forms of quenching. The mathematical link between uorescence-quenching ndings and small-molecule quenchers can be expressed using the Stern\u2013Volmer equation (eqn (4)):28\nF0 F \u00bc 1\u00fe Ksv\u00bdQ \u00bc 1\u00fe Kqs0\u00bdQ (4)\nwhere F is the uorescence intensity of HSA\u2013MY complex, and F0 is that of HSA.

This discovery supported a static quenching process involving the formation of an equilibrium ground state HSA\u2013MY complex.\nIn order to further verify the accuracy of the static quenching results obtained from the mathematical model, the timeresolved uorescence spectroscopy method is used, which is based on measuring the lifetime of the chromophore. If the quenching mechanism of HSA\u2013MY was dynamic, the uorescence life would be reduced due to molecular collision; if the quenching was static, the uorescence life would not change.29 Fig. 1C displayed the time-resolved uorescence curves of samples with varying MY concentrations and constant HSA concentrations. HSA's decay curve was not signicantly altered by the addition of various MY concentrations, demonstrating that HSA's uorescence lifespan was unaffected by the MY addition.\nTriexponential iterative tting was used to evaluate the curves and get the pertinent parameters, namely decay times (si), and pre-exponential factors (ai). And ai represents the relative fraction of si (the lifetime of different components), whose sum is 1. Using the following equation, the average uorescence lifespan (s) of HSA was determined (eqn (5)):14\nhsi = a1s1 + a2s2 + a3s3 (5)\nThe factors and average uorescence lifetime obtained by tting a function are listed in Table 2. The accuracy of curvetting results can be evaluated by analyzing the chi-square value (c2). A low c2 means a good t.15 The tting results showed that the value was about 1, indicating that the curve tting was accurate and the result was reliable. The uorescence lifespan of HSA was unaffected by the addition of MY, which was negligible (<0.1 ns). These ndings supported the ndings of molecular-uorescence spectroscopy by demonstrating the formation of a ground-state complex between MY and HSA and the static nature of the quenching process.\n3.1.2. Binding capability and forces. Based on the static quenching result and literatures,30\u201333 the relevant parameters of the binding process can be obtained by the following assumptions: If the quenching agent (Q) interacts independently with a group of equivalent sites (n) on the protein and closely combines to form (QnP), the equilibrium should be reached:34\u201336\nnQ + P # QnP (6)\nThen the binding equilibrium constant is derived:\nKa = [QnP]/([P]free \u00d7 [Q] n free) (7)\nIf a binding ligand can alter a protein's intrinsic uorescence and no intermediate is created, the binding of n solutes occurs in a sole elementary step, the modied Stern\u2013Volmer equation can be obtained as:\nlg\nF0 F\nF\n\u00bc lg Ka \u00fe n lg\u00bdQ (8)\nwhere [Q] is the quencher concentration, F0 is the uorescence intensity of the protein without quencher and F is that with quencher. Ka is the binding constant.\nFor HSA\u2013MY system, it is static quenching, so eqn (8) is applicable and can be used to further calculate relevant parameters. The Ka and n were calculated as indicated in Table 1. Ka had a magnitude of 10\n4, and n was not far from 1. These results imply that MY attached to HSA with a single affinity site and a moderate strength (103 to 106 L mol\u22121).37 Additionally, heating promoted the binding of HSA and MY, thereby enhancing the stability of the HSA\u2013MY supermolecule complex.\nFor interaction analysis, multiple forces including hydrophobic, hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic, and van der Waal interactions may all play a role in the binding of ligands to biomacromolecules.38 The sorts of molecular forces involved in molecule-binding processes (DG, DH, and DS) can be reected in the quantities and symbols of relevant parameters.

The following eqn (11) was utilized to investigate MY binding sites:\nI \u00bc F F0 100% (11)\nwhere F0 and F are the uorescence intensity of the system before and aer adding 0\u20136 mM MY/Phz/Ibf, respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. 2A, the addition of Phz causes a greater uorescence quenching degree of HSA than MY at the same concentration (3 mM), the result indicates that the quenching ability of Phz is stronger than that of MY, that is, Phz has bigger binding ability to HSA than MY. However, the uorescence intensity of HSA is almost unchanged aer adding Ibf, which means that Ibf has no quenching effect on protein intrinsic uorescence. This phenomenon can be clearly illustrated by Fig. 2B, and these results are consistent with the previous reports.43,44 As shown in Fig. 2B, the F/F0 value of the HSA\u2013MY\u2013 Phz system is higher than HSA\u2013Phz system and lower than HSA\u2013 MY system. Since the binding constant of Phz/Ibf (105 M\u22121) is higher than MY (104 M\u22121),45,46 Phz competes with MY with the adding of Phz, resulting in a complex system of HSA\u2013MY and HSA\u2013Phz. Thus, the F/F0 value of HSA\u2013MY\u2013Phz complex system sits between the two blank systems when it reaches dynamic equilibrium. Also, the uorescence intensity of the system will not change with the addition of Ibf. When system equilibrium reaches, Ibf does not compete with MY, HSA\u2013MY\u2013Ibf system that two ligands bind to a protein at the same time forms. Because Ibf is not a quencher, the F/F0 value remains the same as that ofHSA\u2013 MY before adding Ibf. Thus, in this work, MY competes with only Phz on site I of HSA. In addition, the structural characteristics of MY can also provide information about binding sites. Conjugated molecules such as benzene rings are more likely to site I, while\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nothers, such as long chain fatty acids aremore easily bound to site II,14,47\u201349 MY is azobenzene derivative molecule, which is more likely to bind at the site I. In a word, MY and Phz have a competitive binding in the same region on HSA, namely site I."

A decrease of the ahelix illustrated that MY induced a change in the HSA conformation. However, the information about peak shape and location did not dramatically alter, the situation indicated that the combination of MY was mild and ensured the overall stability of HSA.\n3.2.3. PSH determination. The transporter HSA's hydrophobicity on the surface affects the interaction of ligands. ANS can monitor changes in surface hydrophobicity, because its uorescence is signicantly enhanced when it combines with the corresponding hydrophobic region of HSA that relevant hydrophobic characteristic information can be measured by the numerical value of PSH.53 The following equationmight be used to calculate PSH:\nPSH \u00bc Fmax\u00bdHSA Kappd (14)\nwhere Fmax is the maximum uorescence intensity when ANS is combined with HSA to saturation state, and 1/Kappd is the affinity degree of ANS in HSA\u2013MY system, and these two parameters can be obtained by using the eqn (15):\nF \u00bdANS free \u00bc F K app d \u00fe Fmax K app d\n(15)\nwhere [ANS]free is the concentration of free ANS. Similarly, the other related parameters are related as follows: ([ANS]bound = F/ B in which F is uorescence intensity, B is a dimensionless factor coefficient. In other words, F and bound ANS concentration exhibit a linear connection when the concentration of ANS is very low. Based on the correlation between total ANS concentration and bound ANS concentration, free ANS concentration is calculated. [ANS]free = [ANS]total \u2212 [ANS]bound). Fig. 4A's curve illustrated the increase in uorescence intensity when ANS and HSA\u2013MY bind to saturation. The Fmax was 288.06 \u00b1 0.105 with MY and 211.82 \u00b1 0.149 without MY respectively (Table 4). Notably, the values of 1/Kappd fell when MY was present, indicating that the competitive combination of MY and ANS in the drainage area leaded to the decrease of the combination amount of ANS and HSA, resulting in the above changes. A 68% decrease was also found in DPSH in the presence of MY. This result may be due to the tight binding between MY and HSA, made the hydrophobic cavity of the site shrink spatially.

By using urea-induced denaturation, the impact of MY binding on the stability and unfolding characteristics of HSA was investigated. Denaturation increased the exposure of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan in protein molecules to water, thereby changing the emission characteristics of uorescence properties.54,55 Compared with HSA, a new tyrosine peak with a slight red shi was found at 308 nm (Fig. 4B), indicating a change in the polar environment, which may be due to the increased distance between Trp and Tyr leading to a decrease or stop of energy transfer. Addition of exogenous urea reduced the uorescence intensity characteristics of HSA (Fig. 4B), whichmay be due to its interaction with HSA and structural changes. Meanwhile, the change of uorescence intensity was very weak, indicating that MY could not effectively quench the uorescence of denatured HSA. Adding urea, the hydrophobicity around the interaction residues of MY and protein decreased, and Ka decreased signicantly, that is, the hydrophobic force was more important in the binding process."

To examine the HSA\u2013MY system's natural dynamics, MD simulation was carried out under articially realistic physiological settings that the optimal conformation comes from the docking experiment. The purpose was to obtain details about the information about the dynamic stability of the HSA\u2013MY system (Fig. 5).\nIn MD simulations, the deviation of protein skeleton atoms in the HSA\u2013MY system is measured by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), and it is also used to assess if the system is in equilibrium.56 The RMSD values of Ca atoms for the HSA\u2013MY systems were shown during the simulation in Fig. 6A. In the process of 0\u201386 ns, the overall trend of RMSD of HSA\u2013MY and HSA system is increasing, and the maximum values of RMSD are 4.99 \u00c5 and 3.94 \u00c5 respectively, which means that the skeleton structure of the two systems has experienced some dynamic changes. Meanwhile, the RMSD of HSA\u2013MY system decreases during the process of 80\u201386 ns, contrary to that of HSA system, which shows the inuence of MY on the skeleton structure of HSA. In the process of 86\u2013100 ns, the RMSDs of the two systems are lower than the maximum value of the RMSD of each system, and the uctuation range of RMSD of the two systems is within 1.8 \u00c5, then the RMSD curves tend to be at. According to the literature, the uctuation range of the RMSD of the system was lower than 2 \u00c5, indicating that the system was well equilibrated.57 Thus, the two systems reach dynamic equilibrium aer 86 ns. Meanwhile, the structure of HSA was marginally more stable than that of HSA\u2013MY, as evidenced by the fact that compared to HSA the RMSD of HSA\u2013MY was lower.

The skeleton of HSA\u2013MY was looser during the simulation process, keeping the Rg of HSA high throughout (Fig. 6B), indicating that the addition of MY altered the amino acid environment surrounding the binding site, leading to the results mentioned above. This result was in line with those from 3D uorescence experiments. Aer 90 ns, there is a narrow range of variation in the Rg of the two systems, indicating that the steady-state equilibrium has been reached.\nRoot-mean-square uctuation (RMSF) could further reect the degree of deviation freedom of skeleton atoms in supramolecular system. In the simulation procedure, a bigger RMSF was associated with a higher divergence of the corresponding amino acid residues compared to the initial state. Before and aer the introduction of MY, RMSF has great similarity of continuous change (Fig. 6C). However, in the terminal region, i.e., the region with amino acid sequence over 500, RMSF produced a large uctuation, indicating that the amino acids of the terminal region had a higher degree of freedom. Further analysis of the RMSF of amino acid residues near the binding site of MY on HSA, as shown in Fig. 6D, indicated that the RMSF value of HSA\u2013 MY was slightly higher than that of HSA, which increased the degree of freedom of related amino acid residues.

            "text": "HSA serves as a transport protein in the majority, but it also acts as a catalyst for esterase-like activity,59 which means that it can be effectively affected by small molecules such as drugs. For example, the binding of noscapine to proteins resulted in decreased esterase-like activity of HSA. Among the process of HSA exerting esterase activity, Arg410 and Tyr411 play an important role that Tyr411 is closely related to p-NPA acetylation.60 For the HSA\u2013MY system, v0 and [S] are substituted into the Michaelis equation for tting under different molar ratios (Fig. 7A), and Phz/Ibf as control, relevant kinetic parameters are listed in Table 5. When MY/Phz/Ibf is added individually, the value of Km increases in three systems. Kmis related to the nature of HSA, the result indicates that the affinity of HSA decreases. And the value of vmax remains almost unchanged, as shown in Fig. 7B, the intercept (1/vmax) of the straight line is basically unchanged, but the slope (Km/vmax) gradually increases (Ibf > Phz >MY). This shows that when addingMY/Phz/Ibf, their inhibition mode is competitive inhibition.61 Meanwhile, higher Km means lower affinity, which shows that Ibf has stronger inhibitory effect than Phz or MY group. Because Ibf interacts with Tyr411 and Arg410, which affects the esterase-like activity.62,63 Thus, Phz/Ibf will reduce the enzyme activity of HSA by binding. Compared with MY/Phz binding to site I, Ibf binding to site II has the strongest inhibitory effect. In addition, the kcat/Km decreases with the addition of MY/Phz/Ibf, which implies that the binding ability of HSA and substrate p-NPA decreases with the order of Ibf > Phz > MY. Interestingly, when MY\u2013Phz or MY\u2013Ibf mixed, the values of v0 and vmax decrease, the values of Km are basically unchanged, which is a noncompetitive inhibition mechanism.64 When multiple inhibitors interact with HSA, the structure of HSA will be more exible, which may interfere with the binding process of substrate and cause the change of inhibition mechanism.
