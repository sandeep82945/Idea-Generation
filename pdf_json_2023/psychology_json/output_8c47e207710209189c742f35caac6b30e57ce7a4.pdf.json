    "abstractText": "Alkanes are the most energy-rich form of carbon and are widely dispersed in the environment. Their transformation by microbes represents a key step in the global carbon cycle. Alkanemonooxygenase (AlkB), amembrane-spanning metalloenzyme, converts straight chain alkanes to alcohols in the first step of themicrobially-mediateddegradationof alkanes, therebyplaying a critical role in the global cycling of carbon and the bioremediation of oil. AlkB biodiversity is attributed to its ability to oxidize alkanes of various chain lengths, while individual AlkBs target a relatively narrow range. Mechanisms of substrate selectivity and catalytic activity remain elusive. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of AlkB, which provides a distinct architecture for membrane enzymes. Our structure and functional studies reveal an unexpected diiron center configuration and identify molecular determinants for substrate selectivity. These findings provide insight into the catalyticmechanismof AlkB and shed light on its function in alkane-degrading microorganisms.",

Their transformation by microbes represents a key step in the global carbon cycle. Alkanemonooxygenase (AlkB), amembrane-spanning metalloenzyme, converts straight chain alkanes to alcohols in the first step of themicrobially-mediateddegradationof alkanes, therebyplaying a critical role in the global cycling of carbon and the bioremediation of oil. AlkB biodiversity is attributed to its ability to oxidize alkanes of various chain lengths, while individual AlkBs target a relatively narrow range. Mechanisms of substrate selectivity and catalytic activity remain elusive. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of AlkB, which provides a distinct architecture for membrane enzymes. Our structure and functional studies reveal an unexpected diiron center configuration and identify molecular determinants for substrate selectivity. These findings provide insight into the catalyticmechanismof AlkB and shed light on its function in alkane-degrading microorganisms.\nHydrocarbons are ubiquitous. Up to800million tons are released each year through a combination of natural seeps, accidental releases from the petroleum industry, and the biological activity of cyanobacteria1\u20133. Thesemolecules are a rich food source for hydrocarbon-metabolizing bacteria and have major impacts on ecosystems4,5. Accordingly, an indispensable step in the carbon cycle is the enzymatic transformation of liquid alkanes to render them biologically useful.\nBacteria that can metabolize liquid alkanes are found worldwide, from the equatorial region6,7 to oil-impacted gulfs8 to hydrocarbon-rich, pristine soils in the Arctic and Antarctica7,9\u201322. Across these environments, the primary enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of liquid alkanes is alkane monooxygenase (AlkB). AlkB oxidizes a range of straight-chain alkanes and is widespread in diverse bacteria that use alkanes as their sole carbon and energy source10,23\u201337. Indeed, it was the most differentially expressed gene in the microbial community that grew rapidly after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill38. AlkB belongs to the membrane fatty acid desaturase (FADS)-like superfamily, which represents a group of non-heme diiron monooxygenases that desaturate or hydroxylate fatty acyl aliphatic chains39. Reflecting the catalytic plasticity of the membrane FADS-like superfamily, AlkB selectively hydroxylates the terminal methyl group of straight-chain alkanes; other members of the family introduce either double bonds or hydroxyl groups into lipid-based substrates, respectively. The first glimpse into the structure of these unique biocatalysts was provided by structures of mammalian stearoyl-CoA desaturase SCD1 and yeast sphingolipid \u03b1-hydroxylase Scs7p40\u201343. Except for the signature histidine-rich motifs, AlkB does not share significant sequence similarities or electron transfer partners with those two fatty acid enzyme families. The exact configuration of AlkB\u2019s diiron center remains unclear. Functional AlkBs have also been identified in pathogenic genera, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37RV, Legionella pneumophilia strain Philadelphia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO131,36,44, which suggests AlkB may fuel pathogen growth36.

Central mechanistic questions remain unanswered: what features differentiate AlkB from the fatty-acid enzymes and enable it to selectively hydroxylate the terminal methyl group of linear alkanes; what features differentiate one AlkB from another, which, in turn, endow the entire family with the remarkably wide substrate range that makes it a cornerstone in the global carbon cycle. The paucity of information has left a substantial gap in our understanding of how AlkB\u2019s structure facilitates its function and has greatly hindered its application to biotechnology.\nAlkB is one of a relatively small number of enzymes whose established function is to transform alkanes into alcohols under ambient conditions (Fig. 1a). This is a chemically difficult reaction because of the non-polar nature of the C-H bond and its large dissociation energy, as well as the challenges associated with the selective activation of O2. Other alkane-oxidizing enzymes include particulate copper-containing methane monooxygenases (pMMO), heme-containing cytochrome P450 enzymes, two flavin-dependent enzymes LadA and AlmA45, and another non-heme diiron enzyme, soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO). AlkB is unique among alkane-oxidizing enzymes because it features a nitrogen-rich ligand environment surrounding the metal center; the other non-heme diiron enzymes have carboxylate-rich iron centers. This suggests AlkB has a distinct catalytic mechanism. Since\ndecades of functional studies have been unsuccessful in defining this mechanism, we sought to gain structural insights into its active site.\nHere, we report a cryo-EM structure of AlkB and concomitant characterizations of its catalytic activities. Our study reveals the architecture of this family of enzyme, key features of the diiron center, and molecular determinants of substate selectivity, which help reconcile >50 years of data on this important but elusive driver of the global carbon cycle."

Fontimonas thermophila AlkB (FtAlkB), which shares 62% sequence identity with the prototype Pseudomonas oleovorans AlkB (GPo1AlkB, Supplementary Fig. 1), was found promising in terms of protein yield and stability (Supplementary Fig. 2a). FtAlkB displayed robust alkane hydroxylase activities on amodel alkane octane (5\u03bcmoles product/mg protein), which compares favorably to the most active AlkB we had previously characterized (4.5\u03bcmoles product/mg protein for Alcanivorax borkumensis AlkB46) (Fig. 1b). These attributes marked FtAlkB as an excellent candidate for structural and mechanistic studies.\nSince the catalytic activity of AlkB depends on iron, we measured FtAlkB\u2019s iron content using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Our results showed that the purified FtAlkB is loaded with iron, while we did not detect any iron above the background in a control protein.

The specific iron content is roughly two iron ions per protein molecule, in line with the structural observations we present below.\nTo gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of the AlkBcatalyzed reaction, we carried out single-particle cryo-EM studies on FtAlkB purified in the detergent n-Dodecyl-\u03b2-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1). To overcome the protein\u2019s relatively small size (45 kD) and to facilitate particle alignment, we developed a nanobody that specifically binds to FtAlkB and forms a stable complex (Supplementary Fig. 2b).With the aid of a nanobody as a fiducial marker, we obtained 3D reconstructions of FtAlkB at a resolution of 3.45 \u00c5 (with amask on FtAlkB only; 3.59\u00c5 with amask on FtAlkBnanobody), and the local resolution of FtAlkB reaches 2.8\u00c5 to 3.2 \u00c5. The high-quality map of FtAlkB allowed us to unambiguously trace the protein and build a model (Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 4a)."

            "text": "The FtAlkB structure consists of a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a catalytic domain. The \u2018positive-inside\u2019 rule47 predicts that bothN- and C-termini of FtAlkB should reside on the intracellular side of the membrane, placing the catalytic domain intracellularly. This is consistent with the intracellular location of the redox partners that presumably interact near the catalytic domain. In the TMD, six TMs are arranged in a tent-like shape with their cytosolic ends apart from each other, creating a large interface to accommodate the catalytic domain (Fig. 1e). In addition, the H2 and H3 helices form a reentry loop that is inserted halfway into the membrane. At the membrane-cytosol interface, three helices parallel to the membrane surface help anchor the cytosolic domain onto the membrane and position the structural elements to support the formation of the active site. The cytoplasmic ends of TM4 and TM6protrude out of themembrane and provide two histidine-rich motifs that coordinate the two iron ions. The diiron site\nis further enclosed by two cytoplasmic segments where the other two histidine-rich motifs reside: a helix-turn-helix between TM4 and TM5, and a long C-terminus with short \u03b1-helices (Supplementary Fig. 4g).\nBased on a search of the Protein Data Bank using Dali server48, FtAlkB does not share significant structural similarity to other proteins with experimental structures. AlkB represents a fold that differs substantially from other known protein families, including those in FADSlike superfamily, such as fatty acid desaturase SCD1 and sphingolipid \u03b1-hydroxylase Scs7p (Supplementary Fig. 4e\u2013g)."

            "text": "In FtAlkB, two iron ions are coordinated by nine histidine residues from four conserved histidine-rich motifs (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). One iron is coordinated by five imidazole rings while the other is bound by four (Supplementary Fig. 4b). These histidine residues are invariant across species and were found to be indispensable for the enzymatic functions in GPo1AlkB39,49. The coordination geometry for both irons exhibits some characteristics of an octahedral arrangement, with the other iron appearing along the axis where a ligand is missing; this leaves the two iron ions separated by ~5.4 \u00c5. Our structure directly depicts a nitrogen-rich environment of the diiron center in AlkB. This corroborates the identity of metal ligands surmised from previous spectroscopic studies of AlkB50, and it contrasts sharply with the oxygen-rich coordination found in other known non-heme diiron alkane monooxygenases. We also observed fundamental differences in the configuration of the diiron centers between AlkB and other diiron alkane monooxygenases, such as sMMO. First, the distance between the two ions in FtAlkB is longer at ~5.4 \u00c5 compared to the iron-iron distance of 3 \u00c5 in sMMO. Second, no bridging ligand is observed for FtAlkB, whereas sMMO has carboxylate and hydroxide groups bridging two iron ions. These key differences indicate that AlkB may use a previously unreported mechanism for alkane oxygenation.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2180 3\nThis di-metal configuration of AlkB is supported by observations in other lipid-metabolizing proteins in FADS-like superfamily, including fatty acid desaturases and sphingolipid \u03b1-hydroxylases. Although AlkB shares limited overall sequence and structural similarity with them, AlkB\u2019s signature histidine-rich motifs are organized similarly in space, and iron-coordinating histidine residues form a diiron binding site that resembles those in fatty acid desaturases and sphingolipid \u03b1hydroxylases (Fig. 2b, c). The varying spacing between histidine residues is compensated by distinct helical conformations. These observations suggest a certain degree of shared catalyticmechanismamong these nitrogen-rich diiron centers.\nNevertheless, there are important differences: there is a carboxyl group of a conserved glutamate residue, E281, in AlkB that is near Fe1 (the iron coordinated by four histidine residues) that could potentially interact with that iron and nearby histidine residues, although the side chain of E281 is not sufficiently resolved in the cryo-EM map. In contrast, a water molecule occupies a similar position in SCD1 while Scs7p has one additional histidine forming five histidine coordination for both irons (Fig. 2c). These differences in irons\u2019 surrounding environment may affect the reactivity of irons and the stability of reaction intermediates, whichmayplay a role in the distinct reactions catalyzed by these enzymes."

            "text": "Understanding how inert hydrophobic substrates reach AlkB\u2019s active site is critical to elucidating its hydrocarbon processing ability. TM2, TM4, and TM6 form an elongated vestibule that extends from the TM domain into the catalytic domain and reaches just above the active site. The vestibule is lined mostly by hydrophobic residues, and the vestibule\u2019s diameter is compatible with alkane binding (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, we found an elongated tubular non-protein density occupying the vestibule (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4c). One end of the tubular density is near the active site and the distal end is close toW62. The shape of the density is compatible with an acyl chain, and the surrounding hydrophobic residues could help to accommodate an alkane. We tentatively placed dodecane into the density based on the length match, although the density\u2019s molecular identity cannot be unambiguously resolved at this resolution. The end of the alkane is positioned at a similar distance to the two irons (~5.1 \u00c5 and ~5.7 \u00c5, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 4d).\nAmong vestibule-lining residues, three leucine residues, L274, L315, and L318, are highly conserved (Supplementary Fig. 1). L274 and L318 interact with alkane near its terminus (the site of oxidation) from the opposite side. These two residues thus help position the alkane\nproperly for the catalytic reaction. L315, located at the distal part of the hydrophobic cavity, also contacts the alkane (Fig. 3b). In addition, the conserved L315X2L\n318 motif links a hydrophobic helix (H4) to the last histidine-rich motif (H321X2HH\n325). In our functional studies, substituting tryptophan for L274 or L318 abolished FtAlkB\u2019s catalytic activity (Fig. 3c). On the other hand, L315W substitution had little effect on the activity. These results highlight the importance of sidechain size for L274 and L318, consistent with their proposed role in positioning the substrate for the active site. The distal region of the substrate channel, where L315 is located, may accommodate more variability during the catalysis."

            "text": "In the substrate vestibule, W62 sits at a strategic position, packing against the last segment of the alkane. W62 and L141 (which interact with the alkane\u2019s terminus from the other side) define a narrowportion of the vestibule. This narrow region may present a hurdle to accommodating alkanes with more than 12 carbons. Notably, previous studies showed that the equivalent position of W62 in GPo1AlkB (W55) is correlated with the differential ability of bacteria to grow on alkanes: GPo1AlkB and its close homologs with tryptophan in this position can grow on alkanes with 5 to 12 carbons, with the optimal alkane chain length being close to 8. In contrast, AlkBs that possess a small hydrophobic residue (A, V, L, or I) at the sameposition canmetabolize longer alkanes, specifically those with at least 12 carbons44,49,51. These observations are consistent with an important role for W62.\nTo further test the hypothesis that the residues that restrict the substrate channel dictate substrate selectivity, we assessed the activity of FtAlkB and its W62V variant on alkanes ranging from 5\u201314 carbons (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 5a). FtAlkB is active on alkanes with 6\u201312 carbons, with optimal activity onheptane and octane. For alkanes with >12 carbons, we observed no detectable activity. The W62V variant clearly shifted the substrate selectivity: it showed significantly increased relative activities for longer-chain alkanes such as decane, undecane, and dodecane. TheW62Vmutant can also oxidize tridecane and tetradecane. Our experiments using GPo1AlkB showed a similar trend (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Interestingly, a recent mutagenesis study on D. cinnamea AlkB showed that changing a less bulky amino acid at the position equivalent to FtAlkB\u2019s W62 into a bulkier one (V91W) decreased activities on longer alkanes52. These results underscore the important role the sidechain size of this position plays in determining the length of optimal substrates.\nAll of these results together are consistent with a model in which eachAlkB hasevolved a substrate channel that closelymatches the size\nSource Data file.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2180 4\nof its target alkanes,much like a long eveningglove tightlyfits thehand and arm that slides into it."

            "text": "Our structure of FtAlkB reveals the architecture of this family of important enzymes. AlkB adopts a protein fold not previously observed experimentally, while sharing an overall conserved di-metal coordination geometry with membrane fatty acid desaturases and sphingolipid\u03b1-hydroxylases. The AlphaFold53model (AF-A0A1I2KHB9F1) aligns well with our FtAlkB structure (root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d) = 1.163 \u00c5, Supplementary Fig. 4e), demonstrating its ability in predicting an unknown structural fold. On the other hand, the lack of metal ions in the AlphaFold predicted structure limits its catalytic insights.\nOur structure and functional studies provide important insights into how AlkB achieves substrate selectivity. The substrate\u2019s terminal methyl group is positioned near the diiron active site. A bulky amino acid ~13 \u00c5 from the active site differentiates AlkBs that preferentially oxidize alkanes of approximately eight carbons from those that efficiently oxidize longer alkanes (and concomitantly less efficiently oxidize shorter alkanes54), which have a less bulky residue in that position. It is conceivable that the bulky amino acid may serve as a barrier to\nlonger alkanes while also helping to hold optimally sized non-polar alkanes in place54. Potentially, other structural features in the substrate channel might provide additional discrimination. Our structure thus provides a foundation for future efforts to engineer AlkB for biotechnology applications.\nIn our AlkB structure, TM2, which anchors the distal end of the substrate, does not interact with adjacent TMs on the cytosolic side, leaving lateral openings to the lipidbilayer. Each opening is guardedby a hydrophobic helix parallel to the membrane, suggesting a possible gate that allows substrate entrance or product release (Fig. 4c). This suggests TM2might control a lateral pathway that allows substrates to enter the channel and products to exit it. Such a lateral gate would allow alkanes that partition into the membrane to reach the active site via the shape-matched substrate channels of AlkB. Similarly, after the reaction, the alcohol products would be released through the same pathway so they can be further oxidized via the fatty acid oxidation system to provide energy and a carbon source to the bacterium.\nSelective C-H bond activation is a holy grail of chemistry55. Thus, how members of the FADS-like superfamily do C-H activation chemistry has long been amatter of intense interest. Our structure provides valuable insights into this process. In our structure, AlkB positions the terminal methyl group near the diiron active site. For the fatty acid desaturases, internal C-C bonds are positioned to be desaturated. These observations together suggest that members of the FADS-like superfamily position long alkyl chain substrates in a substrate channel in such a way that the bonds to be broken are adjacent to the active site. Catalysis is thought to create a common high-valent intermediate that can bifurcate to desaturate or hydroxylate.\nWe and others had hypothesized that the FADS-like superfamily generates a catalytically competent intermediate that is similar to compound Q of the other well-characterized diiron C-H activating enzyme, sMMO54,56\u201359. It was thought that two iron ions of AlkB would be electronically connected to provide an energetic advantage in sharing the electron-deficient intermediates that are required to abstract a hydrogen atom from a strong C-H bond. Unexpectedly, our structure shows AlkB\u2019s nitrogen-rich active site has a long distance between the two iron ions and lacks a bridging ligand. This configuration is fundamentally different from the oxygen-rich non-heme diiron center of sMMO. Instead, AlkB\u2019s active site resembles that of membrane fatty acid desaturases and sphingolipid \u03b1-hydroxylases (irrespective of bound iron or incidentally incorporated zinc ion in those two enzymes). These observed comparable active site configurations from multiple distinct enzymes under different conditions strongly suggest that the diiron center formed by histidine residues in the FADS-like superfamily differs sufficiently from that of sMMO to require a distinct catalytic intermediate.\nThe structure presented here, combined with prior mechanistic work from our group, enables us to speculate on AlkB\u2019s mechanism46,54,58\u201361 (Supplementary Fig. 6). The long-distance observed between the two iron ions suggests a mechanism in which the two irons play different roles, with one iron serving as an electron relay and a site for water binding, while the other iron ion serves as the site of catalysis. Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) from a Fe(II)OH2 species on iron one to the second iron ion where O2 is bound, would form a ferric peroxo species and a ferric hydroxide species, which would be readily protonated. Heterolytic cleavage of the O-O bond would form a ferric hydroxo species on one iron, water, and the catalytically competent Fe(V) oxo on the other iron. Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that the one other metalloenzyme with a substrate radical lifetime comparably long to AlkB is naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO), where a formally Fe(V) oxo species is postulated to be the active species62. As has been seen with Mn(V) oxo species, the electronic structure of the rebounding species (in the case of AlkB, Fe(IV)-OH) impacts the radical lifetime63. It also remains possible that there might be a substantial rearrangement of the active site during\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2180 5\nthe reaction, not seen in our structure, which could lead to a more sMMO-like reaction mechanism64. Detailed spectroscopic characterization of reaction intermediates will be the subject of future work."

Images with a CTF resolution better than 8 \u00c5 were selected, yielding 4,965 images. A half dataset was used to auto-pick by templates generated from Blob picker. After 2D classification, 51,617 particles with different views were used for training in Topaz v0.2.470. Subsequently, 1,739,854 total particles were extracted with a box size of 160 pixels and 2 \u00d7 2 binning and subjected to 2D classification, heterogeneous refinement, and Ab-Initio reconstruction. The well-defined subset of 242,089 particles was reextracted with a box size of 224 pixels and refined to yield 4.47 \u00c5 map in non-uniform refinement with the settings of 12 \u00c5 initial lowpass resolution, minimization over per-particle scale enabled and five extra final passes. For further improving the density, seedfacilitated guided multi-reference 3D classification was performed71. The multi-references include accurate and biased references generated by Ab-Initio reconstruction, resolution gradient maps (4.47 \u00c5 map and other two maps with low-pass filtered resolution of 10 \u00c5 and 20 \u00c5), and noise re-weighted maps (4.47 \u00c5 map and other two maps that micelle was downscaled by a factor of 0.3 and 0.7). After Ab-Initio reconstruction and removal of duplicated particles, 253,772 particles were re-extracted and subjected to heterogeneous refinement with only noise re-weighted maps, resulting in 3.84 \u00c5. The resulted 145,869 particles and 242,089 particles from the initial processing were combined. Duplicates were removed after one round of heterogeneous refinement. After another two rounds of heterogeneous refinement, a total of 107,776 particles yielded amap at 3.72 \u00c5. The final map was reconstructed (FSC = 0.143) at 3.59 \u00c5 for FtAlkB-nanobody or 3.45 \u00c5 for FtAlkB via Local refinement and Local CTF refinement. This map was sharpened respectively by DeepEMhancer72 for better nanobody density and cryoSPARC for better ligand density. Local resolution was calculated by BlocRes in cryoSRARC.\nModel building and refinement The AlphaFold253 FtAlkB model was fitted into the density in Chimera andmanually rebuilt in Coot73. A nanobodymodel from PDB 7SL8 was fitted into the cryo-EM map, and the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) were manually rebuilt with the assistance of AlphaFold2 prediction. The FtAlkB-nanobody model was refined in Phenix74 andwas evaluated byMolProbity. The refinement statistics reported in Supplementary Table 1 is based on the DeepEMhancer sharpend map. Figures were prepared using PyMOL (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC)75, UCSF Chimera76, or ChimeraX77."
