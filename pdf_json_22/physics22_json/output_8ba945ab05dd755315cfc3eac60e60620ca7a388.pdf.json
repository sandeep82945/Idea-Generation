Email: phjwang@ust.hk\nStrain in two-dimensional (2D) materials has attracted particular attention owing to the\nremarkable modification of electronic and optical properties. However, emergent\nelectromechanical phenomena and hidden mechanisms remain under debate. Here, using\nscanning photocurrent microscopy, we observe significant photocurrent enhancement in\nhybrid vertical junction devices made of strained few-layer graphene and InGaN quantum\ndots. Optoelectronic response and photoluminescence measurements demonstrate a\nmechanism closely tied to the flexoelectric effect in few-layer graphene, where the strain can\ninduce a lateral built-in electric field and assist the separation of electron-hole pairs.\nPhotocurrent mapping reveals an unprecedentedly ordered hexagonal network, suggesting\nthe potential to create a superlattice by strain engineering. Our work provides insights into\noptoelectronic phenomena in the presence of strain and paves the way for practical\napplications associated with strained 2D materials.\nKEYWORDS: strain, graphene, InGaN quantum dots, optoelectronics, flexoelectricity,\nelectromechanical coupling\nMechanical strain provides an extra degree of freedom to manipulate the intrinsic electronic\nand optical properties, as well as structural phase transitions1-11. Of particular interest are the two-\ndimensional (2D) materials, which can withstand deformation over 10 % before fracture, substantially larger than the bulk counterparts1, 12. The flexibility to create strain in 2D materials\nhas stimulated much effort with numerous strain-induced phenomena. For example, modification of the bandgap2, 3 and structural phase transitions4 are found in 2D semiconductors in the presence\nof strain. In gapless graphene, strain can open an energy gap with pseudogauge fields and topological behaviors6, 7, 9-11. Mechanical deformation is thus an effective approach to control the\nphysical properties and phase transitions of 2D materials.\nThe flexoelectric effect is one of the critical electromechanical couplings behind strain-related\nphenomena. Compared to the piezoelectricity under uniform strain, flexoelectricity describes the\nspontaneous electrical polarization induced by the strain gradient. Recent advances in 2D materials and nanotechnology allow strain gradients to universally exist at corrugations10, 13, domain walls14 or dislocations15, which are usually orders of magnitude stronger than macroscopic bending16.\nSuch a large strain gradient at the nanoscale makes the flexoelectric effect increasingly dominant\nin the physical properties. Among 2D materials, nonpiezoelectric graphene is an ideal platform to\nstudy the flexoelectric effect17-19. The strain gradient can change the ionic positions and lead to asymmetric distributions of the electron density in graphene17, 18 , which can be exploited to control\noptoelectronic responses. Therefore, experimental manifestations are highly desired. On the other\nhand, traditional piezoelectricity measurements such as piezoelectric force microscopy are generally used to characterize the flexoelectric effect14, 20, 21. However, it is challenging to decouple the intrinsic flexoelectric response from the substrate effect or electrostatic interactions14, 20. In this\nregard, the exploration of optoelectronic phenomena in the presence of strain can shed light on the\nfundamental understanding of electromechanical couplings. In this work, we combine strained\nfew-layer graphene (FLG) with InGaN quantum dots (QDs), a representative optoelectronic\nmaterial, and investigate the strain-related optoelectronic behaviors. We find significant\nenhancement of the photocurrent which arises from the strain-gradient-induced polarization and\nlateral built-in field in FLG. The photocurrent mapping reveals an unprecedentedly ordered\nhexagonal network, suggesting the potential of constructing long-range superstructures by\nmodulating the spatial distribution of local strain in 2D materials.\nHybrid structures are prepared using dry-transfer techniques to integrate exfoliated FLG and\nMOCVD-grown InGaN QDs on sapphire. The structural characterizations of InGaN QDs are\nshown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. The deposition of an ~40 nm amorphous Si3N4 film is performed by PECVD. Due to different thermal expansion coefficients, strain can be readily\nintroduced to FLG by thermal cycles during deposition. (see Methods for details)\nFigure 1a shows the optical micrograph of a typical vertical junction device based on\nFLG/InGaN QDs (device 1). The thickness of FLG is ~6.4 nm, as confirmed by atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM). Two-terminal electrodes are fabricated with a bottom ohmic contact to n-GaN\n(Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) and a top contact to FLG, with the latter shown by the\nyellow bar in the image. The schematic device cross-section and the photocurrent mapping setup\nare illustrated in Figure 1b. A transparent Si3N4 layer is deposited to isolate the top electrode from the substrate and particularly to induce strain in FLG. Due to the negative thermal expansion coefficient of FLG compared to the positive value of Si3N4 22, 23, it is expected that a compressive strain is induced in FLG during cooling after the growth of the Si3N4 film at 300 \u00b0C. We employ scanning photocurrent microscopy to probe the spatially resolved photocurrent response of the\njunction (see Methods). A 400-nm laser is focused onto the sample surface with a 100\u00d7 objective.\nSamples are placed in an optical cryostat, and the data are obtained at a temperature of 6 K unless\notherwise specified.\n3.1-eV photons transmit through the junction and are absorbed by InGaN QDs (optical\nbandgap ~ 2.38 eV estimated from photoluminescence spectra in Figure S3 in the Supporting\nInformation). The asymmetric potential across the vertical FLG/InGaN QD junction leads to the\nseparation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs and a finite short-circuit photocurrent Isc. Typical spatial mapping of Isc under a laser power of 30 \u00b5W is shown in Figure 1c. Remarkably, the spatially resolved Isc shows a profound enhancement at particular positions, marked by the dashed lines. Isc along the lines (red/yellow colors) can be up to four times larger than the interior parts (cyan/green colors). Considering the limited spatial resolution of the laser spot, this enhancement\nis underestimated. More strikingly, these line-like enhanced Isc regions form a hexagonal network structure with a length scale of ~10 \u00b5m.\nAn intuitive statistical analysis of the intersection angle \u03b1 and line angular coordinate \u03b2 is\nperformed, as shown in Figures 1d and 1e. The angle \u03b1 is distributed primarily at ~60\u00b0 and ~120\u00b0,\nindicating an essential hexagonal structure. Consistent results are observed for \u03b2, showing 60\u00b0\nangular periodicity. These observations suggest a sixfold rotational symmetry of the pattern, which\nsuggests the potential to form a hexagonal superlattice. Such a pattern excludes the origin of domain boundaries in graphene, which are reported to break translational or rotational symmetry24.\nWe further perform photoluminescence (PL) mapping on device 1 (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information) and demonstrate that the structural stoichiometric nonuniformity or local defects25 in\nInGaN QDs do not play an important role in the observed photocurrent enhancement pattern.\nThe hexagonal pattern is consistent with the graphene honeycomb lattice, which suggests its\norigin of strain engineering in FLG. We perform AFM measurements on device 1 (Figure S4 in\nthe Supporting Information) and find a uniform topography without any sign of hexagonal ripples.\nThis implies the in-plane deformation of FLG in our case, in contrast to the out-of-plane strains such as wrinkles and ripples usually reported in graphene9-11, 13, 26. The inconsistency of\nphotocurrent mapping and topography also suggests that ripples gapping the junction and blocking\nthe conductance of the photocurrent are unlikely.\nTo characterize the strain in the hybrid structure, Raman spectroscopy has been measured\nwhere the strain leads to peak shifts and intensity modulation of typical graphene Raman modes26, 27. Figure 2a shows an optical micrograph of FLG/InGaN QD device 2 with the same fabrication\nprocesses as device 1. The AFM measurements performed in the dashed rectangular area are\nshown in Figure 2b. White and red dashed lines represent the wrinkles and undistinguishable in-\nplane strain, respectively. Both types of strain strongly affect the 2D Raman mode of FLG, as\nshown in Figure 2c. Compared to the unstrained position \u2460, we observed blueshifts for both the primary peak (5.5 cm-1 and 4.7 cm-1) and shoulder peak (10.1 cm-1, 8.9 cm-1) for positions \u2461 and \u2462, respectively. Based on the reported dependence of Raman spectra on the strain27, 28, the strain\nin our structure is determined to be compressive type with estimated strengths of ~0.2 % and ~0.1 %\nfor positions \u2461 and \u2462, respectively. Moreover, the spatial distribution of strain can be visualized\nin Raman intensity mapping of the 2D mode of FLG (Figure 2d). Red and white dashed lines mark\nthe same strained positions as in the AFM image in Figure 2b. The above characterizations indicate\nthat compressive strain is induced at certain locations in the FLG of our hybrid structure.\nprocesses for the cases of Vds < Voc and Vds > Voc. Electrons and holes are denoted by red and blue balls, respectively.\nTo gain an in-depth understanding of the enhanced photocurrent at strain locations, we\nexplore the photocurrent generation mechanism in the FLG/InGaN QD junction device. Two-\nterminal I-V characteristics are obtained with the bottom contact grounded, as shown in Figure 3a.\nConsiderable current rectification is observed. Figure 3b shows the photoresponse of I-V curves\nunder a 400-nm laser with the total illumination power indicated. The laser spot is fixed at the\ncenter of the FLG flake, covering both unstrained and strained areas due to the spatial distribution\nof the laser spot. As it can be seen, short-circuit photocurrent Isc is up to ~ -8 nA, and open-circuit photovoltaic Voc is up to ~ 0.2 V as the illumination power increases. Figure 3c shows Isc as a function of excitation photon energies normalized by the incident photon numbers. The monotonic\ndrop of Isc with decreasing photon energy agrees with the interband transition of InGaN QDs (optical bandgap ~2.38 eV). Isc reaches zero at the resonant energy of InGaN QDs because the electron-hole separation process is strongly suppressed by the resonant recombination process in\nInGaN QDs. The band diagrams are depicted in Figure 3d, based on the reported affinity energies, bandgaps and InGaN polarization field29, 30 (see detailed analysis in Supporting Information Note\n1). The thin InGaN wetting layer is not considered here due to the fast relaxation of photocarriers to the lower-lying QD levels31. For Vds < Voc including the short-circuit case, the negative polarity of the photocurrent indicates that the photoholes and photoelectrons generated in the InGaN QDs\nare collected by the top FLG and the bottom metal electrode, respectively. A portion of the\nphotoelectrons can be injected into the FLG and recombine with holes. For Vds > Voc, the external electric field strongly tilts the bands. Photoexcited electron-hole pairs in InGaN QDs separate\nfollowing the external field, leading to a positive photocurrent.\nFigure 4a shows the flow diagram of photocarrier conversion processes in the FLG/InGaN\nQD junction. Following blue arrows, the optically excited electron-hole pairs (excitons) in InGaN\nQDs are partially separated and contribute to the photocurrent. Other pairs go through radiative or\nnonradiative recombination processes either in QDs or in FLG. The exciton transfer from QDs to\nFLG and then recombination in FLG are verified by the decreased radiative lifetime in the\nFLG/InGaN QD junction using time-resolved PL measurements (Figure S5 in the Supporting\nInformation).\nBased on the above characterization of strain and optoelectronic responses, the enhancement\nof photocurrent can now be understood based on the flexoelectric effect, as shown in Figure 4b.\nThe inhomogeneous interactions of FLG with the Si3N4 film cause strain to accumulate along the stiff directions of the FLG lattice, presumably along the armchair or zigzag directions with a lower\nformation energy 32-34, in agreement with previous experimental observations35, 36. This is also\nconsistent with the observed hexagonal network of the enhanced photocurrent. The structural deformation in the FLG lattice can change the local charge distributions9, 17, 18, 37 and generate an\nin-plane electric field along the strain gradient. This strain-induced built-in field can efficiently\nseparate electron-hole pairs transferred from QDs to FLG, which is in contrast to regions without strain where the transferred electron-hole pairs tend to recombine nonradiatively in FLG38, 39. The\nseparated carriers can contribute to the photocurrent under the asymmetric potential of the vertical\njunction, resulting in a hexagonal network of photocurrent enhancement (see red dashed arrow in\nFigure 4a). We note that the observed hexagonal pattern suggests the potential to realize a strain superlattice in a more controlled manner36. Similar to moir\u00e9 physics40, 41, the periodic potential\nenabled by the strain superlattice can be a robust and feasible way to discover and control new phases of matter in materials research 6, 9, 42.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrate significant strain-induced photocurrent enhancement in the\nFLG/InGaN QD junction, which is associated with a flexoelectric-driven mechanism. Our findings\nprovide insights into the optoelectronic behaviors of 2D materials in the presence of a strain\ngradient. The unraveled electromechanical coupling provides exciting implications for\nelectromechanically active materials and nanodevices based on graphene."

            "text": "InGaN QD growth. The InGaN QD samples were grown in an Aixtron close-coupled showerhead\n(CCS) MOCVD reactor. Trimethylgallium (TMGa), trimethylindium (TMIn), and ammonia (NH3) were employed as sources for Ga, In, and elemental N, respectively. Thermal cleaning was\nperformed to desorb the residual native oxides at the surface of the c-plane sapphire substrate\nfollowed by a GaN nucleation layer, an unintentionally doped GaN layer, and a 3 \u03bcm silicon-doped\nGaN layer to form a GaN pseudosubstrate. Prior to the growth of InGaN QDs, a 600 nm silicon-\ndoped GaN connecting layer was grown to bury the regrowth interface and provide a smooth surface. An uncapped layer of InGaN QDs was grown at 670 \u00b0C with a V-to-III ratio of 1.02 \u00d7 104.\nThe self-assembled quantum dots are formed by the Stranski\u2212Krastanov (SK) growth mode. The structural characterizations of InGaN QDs can be found in our previous work29 and in Figure S1\nin the Supporting Information.\nVertical junction fabrication. Before transferring FLG, we first used optical lithography and\nBCl3/Cl2-based ICP etching to remove the quantum dot layer and wetting layer to expose the nGaN layer near the sample edge. The bottom contact is fabricated by electron-beam lithography\nand metal deposition to make contact with n-GaN, followed by the surface cleaning process. FLG\nflakes are mechanically exfoliated onto a thin layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and the\nthicknesses are confirmed by optical contrast and later by AFM. With the aid of an optical\nmicroscope and micromanipulators, the selected FLG flake was placed in contact with the QDs to\nform the hybrid structure depicted in the main text. Transfer processes were carried out in a\nnitrogen-filled glovebox. A rectangle-shaped top electrode is fabricated by standard electron-beam\nlithography to make contact with FLG and later acts as the anti-etching pad. A 40-nm amorphous\nSi3N4 film was then deposited on the whole sample surface by PECVD with a growth temperature of 300 \u00b0C. Finally, we used electron-beam lithography, reactive ion etching, and metal deposition\nto etch through Si3N4 and make contact with the top FLG, acting as the top contact.\nOptical/optoelectronic characterization and scanning photocurrent microscopy. Samples are\nplaced in an optical cryostat and the data are obtained at a temperature of 6 K unless otherwise\nspecified. A 400-nm laser was focused onto the sample surface with a 100\u00d7 objective. For PL\nmeasurements, emitting photons are detected by monochromator and photomultiplier tubes. For\nthe time-resolved PL measurement, a pulsed 400-nm femtosecond laser and streak camera system\nare employed for PL excitation and detection, respectively. The scanning photocurrent and I-V\ncharacteristics are measured by the AC lock-in technique at 17 Hz and a Keithley 2636B source\nmeter, respectively. The two methods show consistent results. Precise motorized actuators are\nemployed to mechanically move the sample cryostat to realize the scanning function."
