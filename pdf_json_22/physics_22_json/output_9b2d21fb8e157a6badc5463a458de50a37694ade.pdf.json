Gal. Milton Tavares de Souza s/n, Gragoat\u00e1 24210-346, Niter\u00f3i, RJ, Brazil (Dated: May 18, 2022)\nThe characterization of physical systems relies on the observable properties which are measured, and how such measurements are performed. Here we analyze two ways of assigning a description to a quantum system assuming that we only have access to coarse-grained properties. More specifically, we compare the Maximum Entropy Principle method, with the Bayesian-inspired recently proposed Average Assignment Map method [P. S. Correia et al, Phys. Rev. A 103, 052210 (2021)]. Despite the fact that the assigned descriptions by both methods respect the measured constraints, and that they share the same conceptual foundations, the descriptions differ in scenarios that go beyond the traditional system-environment structure. The Average Assignment Map is thus shown to be a more sensible choice for the ever more prevalent scenario of complex quantum systems. We discuss the physics behind such a difference, and further exploit it in a quantum thermodynamics process.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWhether considering our everyday perception of the surrounding environment or a sophisticated experimental setup, a characterization of a physical system is given in terms of measurement results of its observable properties. The characterization of a physical system is thus not unique: besides considering which features are being observed, it is also necessary to take into account how these features are being observed.\nFor the first consideration, the \u201cwhich features\u201d part, given a set of observed properties \u2013 say a set O = {oi} of expected values oi \u2013, the objective of state inference is to assign to the system a description that abides by the known data. However, more often than not, the number of constraints is not sufficient to single out an unique state for the system, i.e., there are many states which are compatible with the known data. Let \u2126(O) be the set of all descriptions which are consistent with the knowledge about the system. Back all the way to Laplace\u2019s Principle of Indifference, it is only reasonable to appoint the same probability for each description in \u2126(O), and to assign the average description, \u2126(O), to the system. The use of the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) [1, 2], i.e., to assign to the system the description in \u2126(O) which has the maximum Shannon entropy, made this intuitive idea more mathematically concrete \u2013 allowing for the inclusion of constraints and symmetries, and extending its reach to continuous sets. The MEP has found applications in fields as diverse as biology, computer science, and financial markets [3\u201311]. Within Physics, the MEP received a great deal of attention as it recovers the ensembles of statistical physics [12]. The same success is observed in the quantum realm, where one now assigns to the system the quantum state that maximizes the von Neumann entropy, while respecting the known constraints [13, 14].\n\u2217 vallejos@cbpf.br \u2020 fmelo@cbpf.br\nConcerning \u201chow\u201d features are measured, most inference methods, and the MEP in particular, are somewhat reticent. For quantum systems \u2013 which are the subject of the present contribution \u2013, the only point which is systematically taken care of is the locality of the observables. Consider for instance the scenarios described by the theory of open quantum systems [15, 16]. In such a cases it is possible to split the total system into two parts: the system of interest S, which we assume to have access to; and the environment E, whose degrees of freedom we have no control of. Besides a possible restriction on the full system (like the total energy), when inferring the total system description, one usually only knows about local properties of the system.\nMore concretely, associate to the total system a Hilbert space HS \u2297HE , and assume that we know the expected values for a set O of subsystem S properties. Quantum mechanics tells us that there exists a set of observables {Oi} and a density matrix %S , acting onHS , such that oi = tr(Oi%S) for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , |O|}. As the total system lives in L(HS\u2297HE) \u2013 with L(H) representing the set of linear operators acting on H\u2013 the reduced density matrix %S is obtained from the total one, %SE , by \u201ctracing out\u201d system E degrees of freedom, i.e., %S = \u039btrE [%SE ]. Here, the map \u039btrE : L(HS \u2297 HE) 7\u2192 L(HS) is the partial-trace map. If one wants to assign a description to the total system, the local constraints can be extended to the full system as follows:\noi = tr(Oi %S);\n= tr(Oi \u039btrE [%SE ]); = tr(\u039b\u2217trE [Oi] %SE); = tr(Oi \u2297 1E %SE).\nIn the above, \u039b\u2217trE : L(HS) 7\u2192 L(HS\u2297HE) is the trace-dual map associated to the partial-trace operation, which only augments the observable with the identity matrix in the E sector. One can now use an inference method to assign a description the total system, which should abide by the constraints oi = tr(Oi \u2297 1E %SE) for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , |O|}.\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n07 95\n6v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 6\nM ay\n2 02\n2\n2 (a) Open quantum system (b) Generalized coarse-grained scenario\nFIG. 1. Here we represent a quantum system composed of a set of spins with the interaction among them represented by lines. In a fully microscopic description we must take into account all degrees of freedom (a single spin representing one local degree of freedom). (a) In the open quantum system scenario the effective description of a system is given by splitting the microscopic degrees of freedom between into those we have access to \u2013 the red spins identified as the system \u2013, from those we don\u2019t have access to \u2013 the blue spins identified as the environment \u2013 which are removed by the partial-trace map. (b) Example of a scenario where, depending on how coarsegrained is the effective description, the open quantum system scenario cannot be applied. In this case the effective description of the underlying microscopic system is given by effective spins, each one related to a coarse-grained detection of two underlying spins. Physically speaking, such a scenario can model a situation where we do not resolve any individual microscopic degree of freedom of the system, but we only have access to the effective description that emerges from a blurry detection of the whole system.\nHowever, with the control of quantum systems reaching unprecedented levels, as driven by the development of modern quantum technologies, a new scenario comes forth. In this new picture, highly isolated complex quantum systems are produced whose microscopic description is experimentally challenging \u2013 requiring single particle addressing \u2013, and theoretically hopeless \u2013 due to the exponential increase of system dimension with the number of particles. In this new scenario, not only the observed data is local, but it also stems from an effective description of the system.\nIn order to deal with this new class of phenomena, quantum channels with the output dimension smaller than the input dimension, dubbed coarse-graining channels, were used to obtain a system\u2019s effective description [17\u201331]. In this formalism, a coarse-graining map is thus a completely positive map \u039b : L(HD) 7\u2192 L(Hd) such that dim(HD) > dim(Hd). Very much like the partial trace map, the output description has fewer degrees of freedom than the total description. Differently from the partial trace, general coarse-graining maps do not require a clear-cut split between system and environment, being thus more appropriate to effectively describe complex highly interacting isolated quantum systems. See Fig. 1 for an\nexample of effective description possible to be characterized by general coarse-graining maps, and how it differs from the usual partial-trace situation.\nIn the proposed framework, suppose that to a system\u2019s effective description we associate a Hilbert space Hd, and that we know the expected values for a set O of effective properties. As before, there exists a set of observables Oi and a density matrix %d, in L(Hd), such that oi = tr(Oi%d) for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , |O|}. Since %d is an effective description, we can assume that it is the result of a coarse-graining map acting on a microscopic description %D \u2208 L(HD), i.e., %d = \u039b[%D]. If we want to infer the microscopic description, we can extend the known constraints as previously:\noi = tr(Oi %d);\n= tr(Oi \u039b[%D]); = tr(\u039b\u2217[Oi] %D).\nIn the above, \u039b\u2217 : L(Hd) 7\u2192 L(HD) is the trace-dual map associated with the coarse-graining channel map \u039b. These constraints can now be included in an inference method to obtain a microscopic description that abides by the coarsegrained data.\nWhile in principle one could use the MEP to assign a description to the microscopic state, when studying the effective dynamics that might emerge from a coarse-grained dynamics [32], an assignment map naturally surfaced. Consider the set of all states which are consistent with the coarse-grained data, i.e., the set\n\u2126\u039b(O) = {\u03c8 \u2208 L(HD) | tr(Oi\u039b[\u03c8]) = oi, \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , |O|}}. (1) As in the foundations of the MEP, in Ref. [32] it was suggested to assign to the underlying system the description given by the uniform average of the states, \u2126\u039b(O) \u03c8 . The map A\u039b : O 7\u2192 L(HD) that takes the known coarse-grained data and assigns to the system a uniform average among all the fine-grained descriptions that agree with the data was named Average Assignment Map (AAM) \u2013 more details below.\nDue to the undeniable importance of the Maximum Entropy Principle in the whole Physics, it is the aim of the present contribution to compare the assignments inferred by the MEP with those inferred by the AAM. Furthermore, we explore the difference between these two assignment maps in a simple thermodynamical process."

Moreover, we will use that the system effective description is generated by a coarse-graining map \u039b : L(HD)\u2192 L(Hd).\n3 In the scenario pictured above, notice that a fine-grained state \u03c8 satisfying the coarse-grained constraints O is in general not unique. The set of all fine-grained states in L(HD) that abide by the coarse-grained constraints is then \u2126\u039b(O) \u2013 see Eq.(1)."

Due to the linearity of the expectation value, this perspective suggests an averaging map A\u039b : O \u2192 L(HD) that assigns the appropriate description to the microscopic ensemble [32]:\nA\u039b[O] \u2261 \u2126\u039b(O) \u03c8 = \u222b d\u00b5\u03c8Pr\u039b(\u03c8|O)\u03c8 (2)\nwhere d\u00b5\u03c8 is a prior uniform measure over states in L(HD), and Pr\u039b(\u03c8|O) is a probability density of having the microscopic state \u03c8 given the macroscopic constraints imposed by O and the coarse-graining map \u039b. Note that Pr\u039b(\u03c8|O) = 0 for any \u03c8 6\u2208 \u2126\u039b(O).\nIn the particular case where the set O is big enough as to allow for the full state reconstruction of % in L(Hd), that is O is a tomographically complete set of values, then we can see A\u039b as a map between states, A\u039b : L(Hd) \u2192 L(HD). In this case, that without loss of generality we hereafter concentrate on, the AAM map can be more directly written as\nA\u039b[%] = \u222b d\u00b5\u03c8\u03b4(\u039b[\u03c8]\u2212 %)\u03c8 . (3)\nThe delta distribution makes clear that all states in \u2126\u039b(%) are taken with the same weight in the convex sum.\nIt is important to discuss the role of the measure \u00b5\u03c8 . In a situation where the microscopic system is very well isolated, all the ignorance about the system state is classical. In this case, one can consider that the set \u2126\u039b(%) contains only pure states, and the measure d\u00b5\u03c8 will be the Haar measure over pure states inHD. However, if the coupling to the environment cannot be neglected, then one needs to include mixed states in \u2126\u039b(%), and the choice of the measure \u00b5\u03c8 is no longer unique. Below we explore different measures, and see how they change the assigned description. The important point, nonetheless, is to realize that the measure \u00b5\u03c8 allows one to include prior knowledge about the way the system is being prepared.\nWe used two different methods for calculating the integral in (3) above, the choice of method depending on \u039b and \u00b5\u03c8 . The first method consists in direct calculation of the integral using some representation of the \u03b4 (to be described later).\nAn alternative method takes advantage of the symmetries of \u039b, and we briefly introduce it in what follows.\nDefinition 1 (Channel symmetry). Let U be a unitary operator in L(HD). We say that U is a symmetry of \u039b if\n\u039b[U\u03c8U\u2020] = \u039b[\u03c8] (4)\nfor all \u03c8 \u2208 L(HD).\nIt is sufficient to require that identity above holds for all pure states, for its validity is extended to all linear operators by linearity. Moreover, it is easy to see that all the symmetries of \u039b form a group.\nAssume that \u00b5\u03c8 is unitarily invariant, i.e.,\n\u00b5\u03c8 = \u00b5V \u03c8V \u2020 (5)\nfor all unitary V in L(HD). Then, let U be a symmetry of \u039b, and make the change of variables \u03c8 \u2192 U\u03c8U\u2020 in Eq.(3), to obtain\nA\u039b[%] = \u222b d\u00b5\u03c8\u03b4(\u039b[\u03c8]\u2212 %)U\u03c8U\u2020 . (6)\nAs the assigned state does not change by the application of the symmetry on the fine-grained states, we can average \u2013 with an arbitrary measure \u2013 over a subset of symmetries and still have the same assignment.\nGiven that averages are linear functions, we can perform the average over the symmetries before the average over the micro-states. In some special cases (we exhibit two examples below) it turns out that such an average over some symmetries presents a remarkable property:\nU\u03c8U\u2020 = f(\u039b[\u03c8]) , (7)\nwith f some function (possibly nonlinear). That is, the average over the symmetries is only a function of the coarsegrained data, as f(\u039b[\u03c8]) = f(%). If that is the case, inserting this result into (6), and using the normalization of the measure, we arrive at\nA\u039b[%] = f(%) . (8)"

The scenario described by the blurred and saturated coarsegraining map \u039bBnS, is suggested by optical-lattices experiments [33\u201335]. In such experiments cold atoms are trapped in optical potential wells. Quantum information processing is done by encoding qubits in the atomic energy levels. The read-out of information is commonly carried out by a fluorescence technique [36], which for our illustrative purposes can be described, in the single atom case, as follows: a laser with a well-defined frequency is shone over the atom; if the atom is in the excited state, represented by |1\u3009, a rapidly decaying transition is resonantly stimulated and the atom scatters light in all directions; if the atom is the ground state, state |0\u3009, the laser is far from resonance, and no light is scattered.\nNow imagine that two neighboring atoms are present in the optical lattice, but due to experimental issues it is not possible to distinguish from which atom the light scattered in the fluorescence measurement comes from. In this situation, the two atoms are seeing as an effective single two-level atom. The full coarse-graining map modelling this situation is given\n5 below (details can be found in [24, 29, 32, 37]):\n\u039bBnS[|00\u3009\u300800|] = |0\u3009\u30080| \u039bBnS[|10\u3009\u300800|] = 1\u221a3 |1\u3009\u30080| \u039bBnS[|00\u3009\u300801|] = 1\u221a3 |0\u3009\u30081| \u039bBnS[|10\u3009\u300801|] = 0 \u039bBnS[|00\u3009\u300810|] = 1\u221a3 |0\u3009\u30081| \u039bBnS[|10\u3009\u300810|] = |1\u3009\u30081| \u039bBnS[|00\u3009\u300811|] = 1\u221a3 |0\u3009\u30081| \u039bBnS[|10\u3009\u300811|] = 0 \u039bBnS[|01\u3009\u300800|] = 1\u221a3 |1\u3009\u30080| \u039bBnS[|11\u3009\u300800|] = 1\u221a 3 |1\u3009\u30080| \u039bBnS[|01\u3009\u300801|] = |1\u3009\u30081| \u039bBnS[|11\u3009\u300801|] = 0 \u039bBnS[|01\u3009\u300810|] = 0 \u039bBnS[|11\u3009\u300810|] = 0 \u039bBnS[|01\u3009\u300811|] = 0 \u039bBnS[|11\u3009\u300811|] = |1\u3009\u30081| (17) Although inspired by the resonance fluorescence measurement of cold atoms in optical lattices, the above map has no intention to fully capture all the experimental nuances. Nevertheless, it is worth stressing that \u039bBnS cannot be reduced to a simple partial trace of one of the subsystems. This can be immediately apprehended by observing the diagonal elements \u039bBnS[|01\u3009\u300801|] = \u039bBnS[|10\u3009\u300810|] = |1\u3009\u30081| \u2013 the equalities here are not compatible with the partial trace of either subsystem.\nWe then proceed to contrast the AAM and the MEP assignments for this, physically inspired, but not traditionally described situation. As for the partial trace case, we will assume to have a tomographic description of the effective system, i.e., we will assume that to know % \u2208 L(H2), and we want to determine an assignment in L(H4) which abide by the constraints. The set of fine-grained states that are compatible with the effective system is now:\n\u2126\u039bBnS(%) = {\u03c8 \u2208 L(H4) | \u039bBnS[\u03c8] = %}."

            "text": "In what follows we obtain the AAM assignment considering both pure and mixed states in the set \u2126BnS(%). We start by employing the symmetry method for pure states, and then continue with direct integration for both cases.\na. Symmetry method \u2013 pure-state measure. Let \u03c8 = [\u03c8]ij , with i, j \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}, be the matrix representation in the computational basis of a generic state in L(H4) \u2013 where for the moment we ignore the trace, positivity, and purity constraints that a pure quantum state must fulfill. For the present coarse-graining map, we have\n\u039bBnS[\u03c8] =  \u03c800 \u03c801 + \u03c802 + \u03c803\u221a\n3 \u03c810 + \u03c820 + \u03c830\u221a\n3 \u03c811 + \u03c822 + \u03c833  . (18)\nUsing the above expression in the definition of a channel symmetry Eq.(4), as we show in Appendix A, the symmetries of \u039bBnS can be written as\nU = 1\u2295 1\u2295 V,\nwhere the operators on the RHS act on the following subspaces: the first subspace is given by the span{|0\u3009}, the second one by span{(0, 1, 1, 1)T / \u221a 3}, and the third one is an arbitrary two-dimensional subspace orthogonal to the first two.\nIn this way, V is an arbitrary unitary matrix in two dimensions, such that the group of symmetries of \u039bBnS is isomorphic to U(2). Following the recipe of the symmetry method explained above, we chose a parameterization of V \u2208 U(2), and average over the symmetry group to obtain:\nU\u03c8U\u2020 =  # 4 4 44\u2217 3 4\u2217 3 4\u2217 3  , (19) where the symbols are given by\n# = \u03c800 , (20)\n4 = 1 3 (\u03c801 + \u03c802 + \u03c803) , (21) 3 = 1\n3 (\u03c811 + \u03c822 + \u03c833) , (22)\n= 1\n6 (\u03c812 + \u03c813 + \u03c823 + \u03c821 + \u03c831 + \u03c832) . (23)\nLooking at Eq.(18), and imposing \u039bBnS[\u03c8] = %, we note that for an arbitrary \u03c8 we must have:\n# = %00 , 3 = %11 3 , 4 = %01\u221a 3 , (24)\nwhere %mn, with m,n \u2208 {0, 1}, are the matrix coefficients of % in the computational basis.\nThe , however, cannot be directly written only in terms of the components of %. If we now assume that \u03c8 is a pure state, then we can write:\n\u03c8ij = cic \u2217 j ,where |\u03c8\u3009 = (c0, c1, c2, c3)T . (25)\nIn this case we have\n= 3 |4|2 2 # \u2212 3 2 = |%01|2 2 %00 \u2212 %11 6 . (26)\nPutting all together, when \u00b5\u03c8 is the uniform measure over pure states, then the average assignment map leads to:\nA\u039bBnS [%] =  %00 %01\u221a 3\n%01\u221a 3\n%01\u221a 3\n%\u221701\u221a 3\n%11\n3\n|%01|2\n2%00 \u2212\n%11\n6\n|%01|2\n2%00 \u2212\n%11\n6 %\u221701\u221a 3 |%01|2 2%00 \u2212 %11 6 %11 3 |%01|2 2%00 \u2212 %11\n6 %\u221701\u221a 3 |%01|2 2%00 \u2212 %11 6 |%01|2 2%00 \u2212 %11 6 %11 3\n .\n(27) It is interesting to realize that in this case the AAM depends in a non-linear way on the elements of %. This non-linearity was discussed in greater detail, and applied in an effective communication scenario, in Ref. [25].\nb. Explicit integration method \u2013 pure-state measure. Before using direct integration to calculate the matrix elements corresponding to in Eq.(19) for the case of a mixedstate measure, first we reproduce the pure-state measure result. This will allow us to exhibit the method in simpler setting. After that, the generalization to a mixed-state measure will be relatively straightforward.\n6 In what follows, in order to simplify the calculations\u2019 presentation, we employ a hybrid notation for the effective states % \u2208 L(H2): in part we use its computational basis elements, and in part its Bloch vector representation. Given a fixed effective state % we write it as:\n% = ( %00 0 0 %11 ) + 1 2 ( x \u03c3x + y \u03c3y ) . (28)\nIn the above expression, \u03c3i, with i \u2208 {x, y, z}, are the usual Pauli matrices, x = tr(% \u03c3x) = 12 Re(%01), and y = tr(% \u03c3y) = 1 2 Im(%01).\nAs we are performing the integration over the pure-state measure (the uniform Haar measure), we directly make use of the pure state structure, as specified in Eq.(25). The action of the coarse-graining map \u039bBnS in a generic pure state can then be explicitly written as:\n\u039bBnS[\u03c8] =\n( c\u22170c0 c0(c \u2217 1 + c \u2217 2 + c \u2217 3)/ \u221a 3\nc\u22170(c1 + c2 + c3)/ \u221a 3 c\u22171c1 + c \u2217 2c2 + c \u2217 3c3\n) .\n(29) With the above representations, the average assignment map, Eq.(3), can be expanded as follows for the present case:\nA\u039bBnS [%] \u221d \u222b d\u00b5\u03c8\u03b4 ( c\u22170c0 \u2212 %00 ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( c\u22171c1 + c \u2217 2c2 + c \u2217 3c3 \u2212 %11 ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( tr(\u039bBnS[\u03c8]\u03c3x)\u2212 x ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( tr(\u039bBnS[\u03c8]\u03c3y)\u2212 y ) \u03c8 \u2261 I , (30)\nwhere \u221d indicates that the average state given by the l.h.s, expression, named I, may not be normalized. The normalization constant N is given by\nN \u2261 \u222b d\u00b5\u03c8\u03b4 ( c\u22170c0 \u2212 %00 ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( c\u22171c1 + c \u2217 2c2 + c \u2217 3c3 \u2212 %11 ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( tr(\u039bBnS[\u03c8]\u03c3x)\u2212 x ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( tr(\u039bBnS[\u03c8]\u03c3y)\u2212 y ) . (31)\nThe average assignment will then be given as a quotient of two integrals\nABnS[%] = I N . (32)\nBoth integrals will be evaluated using the same scheme we now show. The first step is to write the integration measure as a function of the coefficients of |\u03c8\u3009 = (c0, c1, c2, c3)T \u2261 c:\nd\u00b5\u03c8 = \u220f i dRe(ci)dIm(ci) \u2261 d(c\u2020, c). (33)\nTo write the measure as d(c\u2020, c) is a reminder of its explicit dependence on the complex coefficients ci. Note that the normalization of |\u03c8\u3009 is implicit in the first two deltas in (30), as long as %00 + %11 = 1.\nFor the present scenario, the effective state % is fixed, and therefore its components in the computational basis, %ij , are also fixed. Nevertheless, for the sake of calculation we will take them as independent variables. As we are going to perform integral transformations, more specifically Laplace (L) and Fourier (F) transformations [38, 39], and then take their inverse transformations, their \u201ctemporary\u201d independence will be just a calculation artifact. Within this perspective, as %00 and %11 are positive valued, we can write:\n\u03b4(c\u22170c0\u2212%00) = = L\u22121{L{\u03b4(c\u22170c0 \u2212 %00)}(s0)}(%00);\n= L\u22121 {\u222b \u221e\n0\nd%00 e \u2212s0%00\u03b4(c\u22170c0 \u2212 %00) } (%00);\n= L\u22121 { e\u2212s0 c \u2217 0c0 } (%00). (34)\nSimilarly, for %11:\n\u03b4(c\u22171c1 + c \u2217 2c2 + c \u2217 3c3 \u2212 %11) = = L\u22121 { e\u2212s1 (c \u2217 1c1+c \u2217 2c2+c \u2217 3c3) } (%11). (35)\nFor the remaining components, x and y, as they might assume negative values, we perform Fourier transformations:\n\u03b4 ( tr(\u039bBnS[\u03c8]\u03c3x)\u2212 x ) =\n= F\u22121{F{\u03b4 ( tr(\u039bBnS[\u03c8]\u03c3x)\u2212 x ) }(kx)}(x);\n= F\u22121 {\u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dx e\u2212ikx x\u03b4 ( tr(\u039bBnS[\u03c8]\u03c3x)\u2212 x )} (x);\n= F\u22121 { e\u2212ikx tr(\u039bBnS[\u03c8]\u03c3x) } (x);\n= F\u22121 { e\u2212ikx c\u039b \u2217 BnS[\u03c3x] c \u2020) } (x). (36)\nIn the last line we employed the dual channel \u039b\u2217BnS, the definition of \u03c8 = cc\u2020, and the ciclic property of the trace. Proceeding exactly in the same fashion for the y component, we get:\n\u03b4 ( tr(\u039bBnS[\u03c8]\u03c3y)\u2212y ) = F\u22121 { e\u2212iky c\u039b \u2217 BnS[\u03c3y ] c \u2020) } (y). (37)\nAfter transforming all the deltas as shown above, and interchanging the order of integration between the inverse transformations and the integral over states, we can define the the Laplace/Fourier transformed versions of both I and N :\nI\u0303[s0, s1, kx, ky] = \u222b d(c\u2020, c) e\u2212c \u2020Ac c c\u2020 , (38)\nN\u0303 [s0, s1, kx, ky] = \u222b d(c\u2020, c) e\u2212c \u2020Ac , (39)\nwhere the matrix A is given by\nA = diag (s0, s1, s1, s1) + i\u039b \u2217[kx\u03c3x + ky\u03c3y] (40)\n=  s0\nikx+ky\u221a 3 ikx+ky\u221a 3 ikx+ky\u221a 3\nikx\u2212ky\u221a 3\ns1 0 0 ikx\u2212ky\u221a\n3 0 s1 0\nikx\u2212ky\u221a 3\n0 0 s1\n . (41)\n7 In this way, the integrals for I\u0303 and N\u0303 are well defined Gaussian integrals (as s0 and s1 are positive, A + A\u2020 is positive definite), which can be readily performed [40]:\nN\u0303 [s0, s1, kx, ky] = \u03c04\ndetA , (42) I\u0303ij = \u222b d(c\u2020, c) e\u2212c \u2020Acc\u2217i cj = \u03c04\ndetA A\u22121ji , (43)\nwhere A\u22121ji stands for the ji element of A \u22121.\nThe next step is to perform the inverse transforms. Although tedious, this step can be directly performed with the aid of a mathematical software like Mathematica [41]. Further details are to be found in the Appendix B.\nWith this final step, all the elements of A\u039bBnS(%), and in particular the one denoted by the , can be obtained. The result, as expected, is exactly the same as the one shown in Eq.(27).\nc. Explicit integration method \u2013 mixed-state measure. Up to now, when dealing with the \u039bBnS coarse-graining map, we assumed that the set \u2126\u039bBnS(%) contained only pure states. Now we deal with the situation where the fine-grained system might be coupled to some other system that we do not have control of, some environment E, and thus all the preparations of our system of interest in L(HD) are already intrinsically described by a mixed state. In such a situation, there exists no unique uniform measure over mixed states. One way to circumvent this is by employing the unique measure of pure states over the whole space, system and environment, and trace-out the environmental degrees of freedom[42].\nWithin this mindset, we write:\n\u2126\u039bBnS(%) = {trE(\u03a8) | \u03a8 \u2208 L(HD\u2297HE), \u039bBnS\u25e6trE [\u03a8] = %}, with \u03a8 a pure state inL(HD\u2297HE). The Average Assignment Map is then expressed as:\nA\u039bBnS [%] = \u222b d\u00b5\u03a8\u03b4(\u039b \u25e6 trE [\u03a8]\u2212 %) trE [\u03a8], (44)\nwith d\u00b5\u03a8 the Haar measure over HD \u2297 HE . It is important to notice that different environment dimensions will lead to different induced measures of mixed states in L(HD) [42]. This is physically related to \u201chow\u201d open our system of interest is, and its implication will be explored below.\nLet {|m\u3009}, with m \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}, be the computational basis in HD, and let {|\u03c6k\u3009}, with k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , dE}, be an orthonormal basis for HE , whose dimension is dE . Then, in order to follow the steps for the pure-measure case, we write:\n|\u03a8\u3009 = dE\u2211 k=1 3\u2211 m=0 ckm|m\u3009S \u2297 |\u03c6k\u3009E (45)\nand evaluate\ntrE |\u03a8\u3009\u3008\u03a8| =\n= dE\u2211 k=1\n( 3\u2211\nm=0\nckm|m\u3009\n)( 3\u2211\nm\u2032=0\nck\u2217m\u2032\u3008m\u2032|\n)\n\u2261 dE\u2211 k=1 |\u03c8k\u3009\u3008\u03c8k|. (46)\nIn the above,\n|\u03c8k\u3009 = 3\u2211\nm=0\nckm|m\u3009 (47)\nare sub-normalized pure states in HD. Associating to each pure state |\u03c8k\u3009 a coordinate vector, i.e., |\u03c8k\u3009 \u2192 ck = (ck0 , c k 1 , c k 2 , c k 3) T we can write trE |\u03a8\u3009\u3008\u03a8| = ckck\u2020, where the summation over repeated indices is assumed whenever it is not explicitly written.\nLike in the pure-state measure, we can split the deltas and define:\nA\u039bBnS [%] \u221d \u222b d\u00b5\u03a8\u03b4 ( ck\u22170 c k 0 \u2212 %00 ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( ck\u22171 c k 1 + c k\u2217 2 c k 2 + c k\u2217 3 c k 3 \u2212 %11 ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( ck\u2020 \u039b\u2217BnS[\u03c3x]c k \u2212 x ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( ck\u2020 \u039b\u2217BnS[\u03c3y]c k \u2212 y ) ck \u2032 ck \u2032\u2020 \u2261 Imixed ,\n(48)\nNmixed \u2261 \u222b d\u00b5\u03a8\u03b4 ( ck\u22170 c k 0 \u2212 %00 ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( ck\u22171 c k 1 + c k\u2217 2 c k 2 + c k\u2217 3 c k 3 \u2212 %11 ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( ck\u2020 \u039b\u2217BnS[\u03c3x]c k \u2212 x ) \u00d7\n\u03b4 ( ck\u2020 \u039b\u2217BnS[\u03c3y]c k \u2212 y ) , (49)\nwhere the integration measure now reads\nd\u00b5\u03a8 = dE\u220f k=1 d(ck\u2020, ck). (50)\nFollowing the pure-state measure recipe, we now perform the integral transformations to obtain:\nI\u0303mixed = dE\u2211 k\u2032=1 ( dE\u220f k=1 \u222b d(ck\u2020, ck) e\u2212c k\u2020Ack ) ck \u2032 ck \u2032\u2020\n= dE N\u0303 dE\u22121 I\u0303[s0, s1, kx, ky] , (51)\nand\nN\u0303mixed = ( dE\u220f k=1 \u222b d(ck\u2020, ck) e\u2212c k\u2020Ack ) (52)\n= N\u0303 dE [s0, s1, kx, ky] , (53)\nwith A, N\u0303 and I\u0303 as in the previous section (pure case). After doing the inverse transforms (see Appendix B), we arrive at the following result:\n=  dE 3dE \u2212 1 |%01|2 %00 \u2212 %11 3(3dE \u2212 1) mixed states |%01|2\n2%00 \u2212 %11 6 pure states\n.\n(54)\n8 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0 5 10 15\nFIG. 2. Comparison between pure and mixed priors. The curves represent the probability density Pr(\u2206|dE) of obtaining a distance \u2206 between the pure and mixed assignments, given a fixed environment dimension dE , when sampling effective states uniformly from the Bloch sphere. According to their probabilities at the origin, the curves correspond to dE = 2, 3, 4, 8, and\u221e (from top to bottom).\nWe included the expression for pure states for the sake of comparison. The pure case corresponds to dE = 1.\nIn Fig. 2 we show a comparison between pure- and mixedprior assignments using the trace distance (\u2206) as a measure of similarity. We plot the probability density Pr(\u2206|dE) of obtaining a distance \u2206 between the assignments using the pure-state measure and the mixed-state measure, given a fixed environment dimension dE . An analytical expression for Pr(\u2206|dE) is derived in Appendix C, and reads:\nPr(\u2206|dE) = 3(\u2206\u2212 2a)2\n8a3 , 0 \u2264 \u2206 \u2264 2a , (55)\nwhere\na = dE \u2212 1\n2(3dE \u2212 1) . (56)\nAs expected, and clearly shown in Fig. 2, the probability of large differences between the pure and mixed measures is greater for big environments. In other words, the error that one makes in assuming a closed system, and thus employing a pure-sate measure as prior, is smaller when the environment is small."

However, the size of the underlying system in the Blurred and Saturated detector scenario was small, a two spin-1/2 system. One may wonder whether such differences still prevail when the dimension of the fine-grained system is much larger than the coarse-grained description.\n9 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0 10 20 30 40\nFIG. 3. Comparison between the MEP and AAM assignments: \u039bBnS. The curves represent the probability density Pr(\u2206\u2032|dE) of obtaining a distance \u2206\u2032 between the MEP and AAM assignments, given a fixed environment dimension dE , when sampling effective states uniformly from the Bloch sphere. The distance between the MEP and the pure-prior AAM assignment corresponds to dE = 1 (red circles). The distance between the MEP and the mixed-prior AAM assignments are labeled according to the corresponding environmental dimension: dE = 4, 8, 16, and\u221e.\nTo address such issue, in this section we exploit the coarsegraining map \u039bJ : L(HD)\u2192 L(H2) introduced in Ref. [43]. The scenario described by \u039bJ is that of a system (that can be a single system, or a collection of subsystems) with total angular momentum J , which is then perceived as an effective single spin-1/2 system. The coarse-graining map \u039bJ is defined as\n\u039bJ [\u03c8] = 1\n2\n( 1+ 1\nj \u2211 i\u2208{x,y,z} tr(\u03c8Ji)\u03c3i ) , (65)\nwhere Ji are the angular momentum components, i.e., the generators of SU(2) rotations around the x, y, z axes in the D-dimensional Hilbert space HD, and \u03c3i are the usual Pauli matrices. In the above expression, j is the largest eigenvalue of Ji, thus fixing D = 2j + 1.\nAn important property of this coarse-graining channel is that it maps a rotated microscopic state in L(HD) to a rotated qubit in L(H2) around the same axis and by the same angle, i.e., \u039bJ preserves the SU(2) structure. Mathematically, this invariance is expressed by:\n\u039bJ [Rn\u0302(\u03b8)\u03c8Rn\u0302(\u03b8) \u2020] = R\u2032n\u0302(\u03b8)\u039bJ [\u03c8]R \u2032 n\u0302(\u03b8) \u2020 , (66)\nwhere Rn\u0302(\u03b8) \u2208 L(HD) and R\u2032n\u0302(\u03b8) \u2208 L(H2) are rotations by an angle \u03b8 around a given axis n\u0302:\nRn\u0302(\u03b8) = exp(\u2212i\u03b8Jn\u0302) , (67) R\u2032n\u0302(\u03b8) = exp(\u2212i\u03b8\u03c3n\u0302/2) , (68)\nwith Jn\u0302 = ~J \u00b7 n\u0302, \u03c3n\u0302 = ~\u03c3 \u00b7 n\u0302, and we are setting ~ = 1. As before we assume that an effective state % is prepared, and we want to determine which state we should assign to the\nunderlying system. Microscopically, the set of fine-grained states that abide by the constraints is written as:\n\u2126\u039bJ (%) = {\u03c8 \u2208 L(HD) | \u039bJ(\u03c8) = %}."

            "text": "Before we dive in the evaluation of the AAM assignments (pure and mixed priors), two general observations are in place. First, note that writing % in its Bloch representation,\n% = 1\n2 (1+ ~r.~\u03c3) ,\nwith ~r.~\u03c3 \u2261 rx\u03c3x+ry\u03c3y+rz\u03c3z , the coarse-graining constraint \u039bJ [\u03c8] = % can be expressed as\n1 j tr(\u03c8 ~J) = ~r. (69)\nSecond, notice that if \u03c8 \u2208 \u2126\u039bJ (%), then Rr\u0302(\u03b8)\u03c8Rr\u0302(\u03b8)\u2020 also belongs to \u2126\u039bJ (%). This follows from the rotational invariance, Eq.(66), when applied to a rotation around the axis defined by the effective state Bloch vector:\n\u039bJ [Rr\u0302(\u03b8)\u03c8Rr\u0302(\u03b8) \u2020] = R\u2032r\u0302(\u03b8)%R \u2032 r\u0302(\u03b8) \u2020 = %. (70)\nEven though Rr\u0302 is not a symmetry of \u039bJ , as defined in (4) (because it is \u03c8-dependent), the above property simplifies the calculation of average assignments.\nThis property can be applied in the general form of the AAM assignment, Eq. (3), by making the change of variables \u03c8 \u2192 Rr\u0302(\u03b8)\u03c8Rr\u0302(\u03b8)\u2020, to arrive at\nA\u039bJ [%] = \u222b d\u00b5\u03c8\u03b4(\u039bJ [\u03c8]\u2212 %)Rr\u0302(\u03b8)\u03c8Rr\u0302(\u03b8)\u2020 . (71)\nAs the assignment in this case, A\u039bJ [%], does not depend on \u03b8, we can average over the uniform distribution of rotations\naround the ~r axis, i.e., we can evaluate Rr\u0302(\u03b8)\u03c8Rr\u0302(\u03b8)\u2020 by integrating over \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. Although we will not explicitly evaluate such an average, by expressing \u03c8 in the common eigenbasis of Jr\u0302 and J2, which we denote simply by {|mr\u0302\u3009} \u2013 with \u2212j \u2264 m \u2264 j and where the sub-index r\u0302 reminds the basis dependence on the Bloch vector of the effective state\u2013, it is immediate to see that\nRr\u0302(\u03b8)\u03c8Rr\u0302(\u03b8) \u2020 = \u2211 m,n \u3008mr\u0302|\u03c8|nr\u0302\u3009e\u2212i\u03b8(m\u2212n) \u00b5\u03b8 |mr\u0302\u3009\u3008nr\u0302|\n= \u2211 m \u3008mr\u0302|\u03c8|mr\u0302\u3009|mr\u0302\u3009\u3008mr\u0302| .\nIn plain text, just using the invariance property, we determined that the AAM will assign to the fine-grained system a state which is diagonal in the basis {|mr\u0302\u3009}. We thus only need to calculate D = 2j + 1 averages.\nPutting these two observations together, we arrive to the conclusion that the AAM for the coarse-graining map \u039bJ can\n10\nbe seen as a function of the effective state % Bloch\u2019s vector (due to the rotational symmetry), and that it can be written as:\nA\u039bJ [~r] = \u2211 m pm(r)|mr\u0302\u3009\u3008mr\u0302| ,\nwith pm(r) \u2265 0 and \u2211 m pm(r) = 1 depending only on the modulus r = |~r| of the Bloch vector due to the rotational symmetry. In what follows, we obtain the pm coefficients as a function of r.\na. Explicit integration method \u2013 pure-state measure. The evaluation of the AAM assigned state now proceeds very closely to the previous calculations. For the present coarsegraining map, \u039bJ , using the observations above, we write\nA\u039bJ [~r] \u221d \u222b d\u00b5\u03c8\u03b4 ( 1\nj tr[\u03c8 ~J ]\u2212 ~r\n) \u03c8 . (72)\nwhere for the moment, d\u00b5\u03c8 , is taken as the uniform measure over pure states acting in L(HD).\nAs the AAM assigned state is diagonal in the common basis of Jr\u0302 and J2, i.e., the basis {|mr\u0302\u3009} defined above, we employ this basis to make the correspondence |\u03c8\u3009 \u2192 c = (c1, c2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , cD)T , and to write the angular-momentum matrices ~J. The integral above then becomes\nA\u039bJ [~r] \u221d \u222b d(c\u2020, c) \u03b4 ( c\u2020c\u2212 E ) \u03b4 ( 1\nj c\u2020~Jc\u2212 ~r\n) c c\u2020 \u2261 I .\n(73) Given that the condition tr[\u03c8 ~J ] = j~r does not directly imposes the normalization of \u03c8, we explicitly included it with the first \u03b4. In the above, we introduced the variable E > 0 for mathematical convenience; at the end of calculations it will be set E = 1 [39].\nAs before, we momentarily take E and ~r as variables. We then perform a Laplace transform, and its inverse, in the normalization condition\n\u03b4(c\u2020c\u2212 E) = L\u22121 { e\u2212s c \u2020c } (E),\nand a Fourier transformation, and its inverse, in the angular momentum constraints:\n\u03b4\n( 1\nj c\u2020~Jc\u2212 ~r\n) = F\u22121 { e\u2212i c \u2020 ~k.~J c/j } (~r).\nIn the above, s and ~k = (kx, ky, kz) are the transformations variables.\nExchanging the order of integration between the inverse transforms and the d(c\u2020, c), we obtain equations analogous to Eqs. (42) and (43):\nI\u0303ij [s,~k] = \u222b d(c\u2020, c) e\u2212c \u2020Ac c\u2217i cj = \u03c0D\ndetA A\u22121ji , (74)\nwith the corresponding normalization\nN\u0303 [s,~k] = \u222b d(c\u2020, c\u2020) e\u2212c \u2020Ac = \u03c0D\ndetA . (75)\nFor the present case, the matrix A is given by\nA(s,~k) = s1+ i k\nj Jk\u0302 , (76)\nwith Jk\u0302 = ~J \u00b7 k\u0302. The next step is to calculate the inverse transforms. We were able to obtain analytical results, but the corresponding expressions are too lengthy to be shown here. Some details are presented in Appendix D. Additionally, Figure 4 shows the diagonal elements pm of the pure-prior average assignment A\u039b[~r] for several values of j.\nb. Explicit integration method \u2013 mixed-state measure The evaluation of the AAM for the \u039bJ coarse-graining averaging over mixed states proceeds in complete analogy to the case of the Blurred and Saturated detector (Sec. III B). As in that case, here we express the results for mixed-states average, in terms of the pure-state case. The results are as follows:\nI\u0303mixed = dE N\u0303 dE\u22121 I\u0303[s,~k] , (77)\nand\nN\u0303mixed = N\u0303 dE [s,~k] , (78)\nwith A, N\u0303 and I\u0303 as in the previous section (pure case). We present some details about the inverse transformations and final results in Appendix D. Diagonal elements pm of this assignment as a function of r are plotted in Fig. 5. We chose\n11\nto show the special case dE = D because that is the minimal dimension for which any mixed state that satisfies the constraints can be purified.\nSome general features of the plots in Fig. 4 and in Fig. 5 can be readily understood. When r = 0, i.e., the effective state is the maximally mixed state, no preferred direction is established. As such the fine-grained state, for both priors, is the maximally mixed state in L(HD), and thus pm(0) = 1/D for all m. On the other extreme, when the effective state is a pure state, r = 1, then the set \u2126\u039bJ (%) contains a single state, which is the state with maximum angular momentum in the same direction as the Bloch vector of %, namely |mr\u0302\u3009\u3008mr\u0302|."

As for the AAM assignment, we assume knowledge of the effective state % \u2208 L(H2). The MEP assignment for this case can then be expressed as the following optimization:\n\u03c8%MEP = arg maxS(\u03c8) (79) s.t. tr(\u03c3i\u039bJ [\u03c8]) = tr(\u03c3i%) = ri ,\u2200i \u2208 {x, y, z}.\nAs explained in II B, under the above constraints, the MEP assignment is given by:\n\u03c8%MEP = 1\nZ exp ( \u2212 \u2211 i \u03bbi\u039b \u2217 J [\u03c3i] ) , (80)\nwith the \u03bbi related to the accessible values via:\n\u2212 \u2202 \u2202~\u03bb lnZ = ~r . (81)\nTo determine the action of the dual coarse-graining channel on the Pauli matrices, it is sufficient to notice that for any \u03c8 \u2208 L(HD), we have\ntr(\u039bJ [\u03c8]\u03c3i) = 1\nj tr(\u03c8 Ji). (82)\nIt then follows that\n\u039b\u2217[\u03c3i] = Ji j . (83)\nThat, in fact, is an alternative way of stating the rotational symmetry of \u039bJ . Hence, the microscopic state that maximizes the entropy is given by\n\u03c8%MEP = 1\nZ exp ( \u22121 j \u2211 i \u03bbiJi ) = 1 Z exp ( \u22121 j \u03bbJ\u03bb\u0302 ) ,\n(84) where J\u03bb\u0302 = ~J \u00b7 \u03bb\u0302, and \u03bb is the modulus of ~\u03bb\nImposing the constraint (81) we obtain at\n\u2212 \u2202 \u2202~\u03bb lnZ = \u2212 \u2202 \u2202\u03bb (lnZ) \u03bb\u0302 = ~r . (85)\nFrom the above expression, we see that ~\u03bb and ~r are parallel. Without loss of generality, we choose \u03bb\u0302 = \u2212r\u0302 and arrive at\n\u03c8%MEP = 1\nZ exp\n( 1\nj \u03bbJr\u0302\n) . (86)\nAt the formal level this state is identical to the canonical ensemble of the Brillouin paramagnet [12], with ~\u03bb playing the role of the magnetic field ~B = Br\u0302 (modulo some constant). Using this equivalence we can readily write the relation between \u03bb and r:\nr = 1 j {(j + 1 2 ) coth [(j + 1 2 ) \u03bb j ]\u2212 1 2 coth \u03bb 2j } = Bj(\u03bb) ,\n(87) where Bj is the so-called Brillouin function of j-th order.\nWith the above we have all the elements to construct \u03c8MEP for the present case. Like for the AAM assignment, the state \u03c8MEP is diagonal in the eigenbasis of Jr\u0302 (and J2), with matrix elements\npm(r) = 1\nZ exp\n( \u03bb m\nj\n) , (88)\n12\nwith m = \u2212j,\u2212j + 1, . . . , j \u2212 1, j, and\nZ = sinh [(j + 1/2)\u03bbj ]\nsinh [ \u03bb2j ] . (89)\nHere we did not explicitly show the r dependence of \u03bb to avoid cluttering notation. Thus, the diagonal elements pm of the MEP assignment can be calculated from Eqs. (87) and (88). The results, for several values of j, are shown in Fig. 6.\nOverall, the MEP assignments are similar to the AAM assignments \u2013 with the same asymptotic behaviours at r = 0 and r = 1. A quantitative comparison is presented in Figure 7, where we show the trace distance \u2206\u2032 between MEP and AAM assigned states as a function of r.\nBoth cases, pure- or mixed-prior are similar, the trace distance being somewhat smaller for the mixed-case. However, as the dimension of microscopic system j is increased, \u2206\u2032 keeps growing, with no sign of slowing-down. In Fig.7 the environmental dimension was chosen to be dE = 2j+ 1, i.e., the same as the system dimension. In Fig. 8 we show that the environment dimension plays no significant role in the distance between the MEP and AAM assignments \u2013 a small decrease is observed, but the distance between the assignments is still appreciable, and it seems to saturate for large dE .

            "text": "In the previous sections we have analyzed different schemes of quantum-state inference from coarse-grained information. This lead to different fine-grained states: the Average Assignment Map (AAM) \u2013 both pure and mixed priors\u2013, and the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) assigned states. The aim of this section is to evaluate the observational consequences of these alternative assignments. In what follows, we exploit a thermodynamical process for which we assume that the effective state is given by the SU(2) preserving coarse-graining map, and inspect the impact of the different assignments in the amount of quantum work that can be extracted from the system.\nLet us consider a microscopic quantum system composed of a particle, or system of particles, with total angular momentum j, which is thermally isolated. Furthermore, suppose that the underlying dynamics is given by the time-dependent Hamiltonian:\nH(t) = \u03b3 cos(\u03c9t)J2z , (90)\nwith \u03b3 > 0, and \u03c9 an external driving frequency. Now assume that we have access to this system only via the coarse-graining map \u039bJ , defined in (65), with effective initial state given by:\n%o = 1\n2 (1+ 0.7\u03c3z) . (91)\nThis initial state is chosen for two reasons. First, as we can see from Fig.(7), the difference between the AAM and MEP assignments is considerable for all values of j. Second, the AAM and MEP procedures will lead to assigned states which are diagonal in the Jz basis, and as such the assigned states will commute with the Hamiltonian. In this situation the quantum work is uncontroversially defined by [44\u201347]:\nW = tr ( \u03c80 (HF \u2212HI) ) , (92)\nwith \u03c80 an initial assigned state (AAM-pure, AAM-mixed, or MEP) and\nHI \u2261 H(0), HF = U\u2020\u03c4H(\u03c4)U\u03c4 , (93)\nwith U\u03c4 the usual time-ordered evolution operator. In such a scenario, the average quantum work reads\nW = \u03b3 (cos\u03c9\u03c4 \u2212 1) tr ( \u03c80J 2 z ) . (94)\nFrom the expression above, it is clear that the difference between the assignments will translate into different values of average work. The results for the quantum work are shown in Fig. (9).\nIt is clear from Fig. (9) that using the MEP assignment always leads to the least amount of work that can be extracted from the system. Moreover, among the AAM assignments, to use the average over pure states is always more beneficial, in terms of extracted work, than using the average over mixed states. This ordering can be understood by the knowledge\nof the physical scenario that each choice entails. While the MEP assignment is fixed given the constraints and the coarsegraining map, for the AAM assignments we still need to specify the measure (the prior) over the microscopic states that abide by the constraints. Choosing a pure state prior is consistent with an experimental setup where the microscopic system is fully isolated. A mixed state prior with a given environment dimension, on the other hand, assumes some lack of control about the microscopic system and some information about the environment. It is then reasonable to expect that from a situation where a pure state prior applies, one can extract more work from the quantum system, as it is the situation where more control about the system is present. Of course, using a prior which is not consistent with the experimental situation will lead to a mismatch between the amount of work predicted, and the one in fact extracted/produced."

            "text": "The maximum entropy principle (MEP) is ubiquitous, and rightly so as it is a cornerstone of thermodynamics and, more generally, of quantum statistical mechanics. Nevertheless, with the raise of complex quantum systems, new scenarios come into play.\nHere we analyzed how an assignment map, which shares some foundational ingredients with the MEP, namely the Average Assignment Map (AAM) behaves in various situations. As expected, in the scenario where only local access to a physical system is granted, the so called Open Quantum System picture, both assignments coincide.\nHowever, in situations that go beyond the systemenvironment split, the two assignment strategies may differ.\n14\nAs we explicitly showed, in the case where two spin-1/2 particles, due to experimental constraints, are seen as an effective single spin-1/2, the two assignments differ \u2013 see Eq. 64 and Fig. 3.\nAs the underlying system is small, a two spin-1/2 particles, one may expect that such a difference would disappear for larger systems. With the coarse-graining map introduced in III C, we discredited this possibility. Even for increasing microscopic system dimensions, the difference between the MEP and the AAM assignments remains \u2013 see Fig. 7. As it can be seen, the difference in fact increases with the underlying system dimension in this situation.\nWhere does the difference come from? Both assignments originate from the same idea: there are many microscopic states that abide by some few coarse-grained constraints. If no further constraints are present, the way we evaluate the expectation value of observable quantities in quantum mechanics suggests that an uniform average among all the states that satisfy the constraints is a sensible assignment. The MEP employs an entropic function to obtain such an assignment, with the idea that uniform mixtures maximize the entropy.\nThe AAM, on the other hand, makes this averaging process explicit. In doing so it becomes evident that an uniform measure over the microscopic states must be chosen. As there is no unique uniform measure among mixed states, the AAM allows for the introduction of some prior knowledge about the experimental condition \u2013 how isolated is the underlying system. If the microscopic system is very well isolated, one can take the average over pure states. If the environmental influence cannot be disregarded, an averaging over mixed states is more judicious. At this point the AAM connects to Bayesian inference methods [48, 49], and we show \u2013 see for instance Figures 2 and 8 \u2013 how the assignments differ for each prior knowledge situation.\nFinally, when should one use the MEP or the AAM? We showed that depending on the access one has of the system, the assigned states may differ. Using the knowledge about how one access the system, and how the system interacts with its environment, if known, can only be beneficial. As different levels of knowledge about an experimental situation are often tied together with more efficient processes, we showed a thermodynamical process where the benefit of employing the AAM assignment is unmistakable (see Fig. 9). The gain of using the AAM assignment, instead of the MEP one, is specially clear in the case where one knows that the system is highly isolated. It should be remarked that choosing an assignment which theoretically would allow for a greater extraction of work, in an experiment scenario which is not befitting with such a choice, will only lead to a poor description and no gain."

As this identity must hold for all Hermitian matrices \u03c7 \u2208 L(H4), the U dependent coefficients ofDij must all vanish. FromD00 = 0, and assuming tr(\u03c7) = 1, we obtain |U00| = 1.

These quantities, related to the average over pure states, are the basis also for the mixed case calculations [see Eqs. (51) and (53].\nWe begin by doing the inverse transforms in the normalization factor N\u0303 . The determinant of the matrix A reads:\ndetA = s21(k 2 x + k 2 y + s0s1) \u2261 s21(\u03ba2 + s0s1) , (B1)\n15\nthe last equality defining \u03ba. We first do the Laplace inversetransform of N\u0303mixed in the variable s0:\nL\u22121s0\n{ \u03c04dE\n(detA)dE\n} (%00) =\n\u03c04dE%dE\u2212100 exp (\u2212\u03ba2%00/s1) s3dE1 \u0393(dE) .\n(B2) Then, we Laplace inverse-transform the RHS above in s1:\nL\u22121s1 {. . .} (%11) = \u03c04dE%\n(3dE\u22121)/2 11 J3dE\u22121(2\u03ba \u221a %00%11) \u03ba3dE\u22121% (dE+1)/2 00 \u0393(dE) ,\n(B3) where J3dE\u22121 is a Bessel function. Now we must do the inverse Fourier transforms on the last expression. Note that such expression only depends on the polar radius \u03ba in the plane (kx, ky). Using r\u22a5 = \u221a x2 + y2, we have\nNmixed(%) = \u222b dkx dkye i(kxx+kyy)(. . .) (B4)\n= 2\u03c0 \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03ba\u03baJ0(\u03bar\u22a5)(. . .)

(B3).\nIn the following we apply the same succession of inverse transforms as above (in the same order) to I\u0303mixed. We focus on the elements the six elements denoted with a square in Eq. (19), as those, for the mixed prior, cannot be calculated using the symmetry method. If we choose, say, A\u039b,23 as a representative, we must inverse-transform I\u0303mixed,23. Combining Eqs. (42), (43), and (51), we obtain:\nI\u0303mixed,23 = dE ( \u03c04\ndetA\n)dE A\u2212132 (B7)\n= dE \u03c0\n4dE\n(detA)dE+1 C23 , (B8)\nwhere C23 is the appropriate cofactor of A, which reads\nC23 = \u2212 \u03ba2s1\n3 . (B9)\nThe first Laplace inverse-transform, in the variable s0, gives\nL\u22121s0 { I\u0303mixed,23 } (%00) = \u2212\n\u03c04dE\u03ba2%dE00 exp (\u2212\u03ba2%00/s1) 3 \u0393(dE)s 2(dE+1) 1 .\n(B10) Transforming the expression above, now in s1, produces\nL\u22121s1 {. . .} (%11) = \u2212 \u03c04dE% (3dE+1)/2 11 J3dE+1(2\u03ba\n\u221a %00%11)\n3\u03ba3dE\u22121% (dE+1)/2 00 \u0393(dE)\n,\n(B11)\nNow we calculate the inverse Fourier transform of the last expression:\nImixed,23(%) =\ndE2 3\u22124dE\u03c04dE\u22121(1\u2212 r2)3dE\u22122[3dE(x2 + y2) + z2 \u2212 1]\n3 \u0393(dE + 1)\u0393(3dE)(1 + z)2dE+1 .\n(B12)\nFinally, forming the quotient I/N , we recover the result of Eq. (54):\nA\u039b,23(%) = 3dE\n( x2 + y2 ) + z2 \u2212 1\n6(3dE \u2212 1)(z + 1) (B13)\n= dE 3dE \u2212 1 |%01|2 %00 \u2212 %11 3(3dE \u2212 1) . (B14)\nAppendix C: Distance between Amixed\u039bBnS and A pure \u039bBnS\nThe trace distance is just half of the trace norm of the difference of the matrices:\n\u2206(%, \u03c3) = 1\n2 ||%\u2212 \u03c3||1 =\n1 2 tr\n[\u221a (%\u2212 \u03c3)\u2020(%\u2212 \u03c3) ] . (C1)\nThe purpose of the factor of two is to restrict the trace distance between two normalized density matrices to the range [0, 1]. Since density matrices are Hermitian,\n\u2206(%, \u03c3) = 1\n2 \u2211 i |\u03bbi| , (C2)\nwhere the \u03bbi are eigenvalues of the Hermitian, but not necessarily positive, matrix (%\u2212 \u03c3).\nThe trace distance between average (over pure or mixed states) assignments can be calculated from Eq. (54). The difference between assignments has the following structure:\nAmixed\u039bBnS [%]\u2212A pure \u039bBnS [%] = 0 0 0 00 0 \u00b5 \u00b50 \u00b5 0 \u00b5 0 \u00b5 \u00b5 0  . (C3) From Eq. (54) we obtain\n\u00b5 = (dE \u2212 1)(1\u2212 r2)\n4(3dE \u2212 1)(1 + z) . (C4)\nThe eigenvalues of the difference matrix (C3) are {2\u00b5,\u2212\u00b5,\u2212\u00b5, 0}. Then, the trace distance \u2206 is\n\u2206 = 2\u00b5 = (dE \u2212 1)(1\u2212 r2)\n2(3dE \u2212 1)(1 + z) . (C5)\nIn order calculate the probability distribution of \u2206 we must compute the following integral over the Bloch ball:\nPr(\u2206|dE) = 3\n4\u03c0\n\u222b dxdydz \u03b4 (\u2206\u2212 2\u00b5(x, y, z; dE)) ,\n(C6) which leads to Eq.

            "text": "In the case of the present coarse graining it is not possible to obtain general formulae of the average assignments for arbitrary j and dE . Each case must be handled separately. In the following we show some details of the calculation of the inverse Fourier- and Laplace-transforms of the quantities I\u0303 and N\u0303 , whose quotient, I(~r)/N (~r), determines the average assignment.\nWe start by calculating the norm N (~r). The determinant (76) reads\ndetA = j\u220f m=\u2212j ( s+ ikm j ) . (D1)\nNote that detA is even function of k. We do first the inverse Fourier transform of N\u0303 (s,~k). As detA only depends on k = |~k|, it is convenient to use spherical coordinates in ~k-space; without loss of generality, we choose z\u0302 = r\u0302. Then, the Fourier transform is given by\nNmixed(s, ~r) = 4\u03c0DdE+1\nr\n\u222b \u221e 0 dk k sin(k r) (detA)dE . (D2)\nNext, we Laplace transform:\nNmixed(~r) = L\u22121s {Nmixed(s, ~r)} (E)|E=1 . (D3)\nBy virtue of the SU(2) symmetry, the norm only depends on the modulus of ~r, for all j and dE . We show one example, for j = 3/2 and dE = 2:\nNmixed(s, r) = 27\u03c010e\u22123rs 128 rs6 [ 2rs+ e2rs(6rs\u2212 3) + 3 ] ,\n(D4)\nNmixed(r) = 9\u03c010\n5120r\n[ 3(1\u2212 3r)5\u03b8(1\u2212 3r)+\n10r(1\u2212 3r)4\u03b8(1\u2212 3r) + 3(r \u2212 1)5 + 30(r \u2212 1)4r ] .\n(D5)\nAs j and/or dE are increased, the expressions above grow rapidly, though preserving the structure: Nmixed(r) is a sum of Heaviside theta functions multiplied by polinomials of r; the theta functions increase in number with j, the polinomials increase in degree with j and dE .\nNow, let us turn to I\u0303mixed. Using Eqs. (75) and (74) into (77), we arrive at\nI\u0303mixed,mm(s,~k) = dE \u03c0dED Cmm\n(detA)dE+1 . (D6)\nWe have observed that Cmm, the diagonal cofactors of A, do not depend on the azimuthal angle \u03c6; then, the inverse Fourier transform reads\nI\u0303mixed,mm(s, r) = 2dE \u03c0dED+1 \u222b \u221e\n0\ndk k2\n(detA)dE+1 \u00d7 \u222b \u03c0\n0\nd\u03b8 sin \u03b8 exp (ikr cos \u03b8)Cmm . (D7)\nThe last step consists in inverse-transforming Laplace (s \u2192 E) the expression above, and setting E = 1. The result, Imixed,mm(r), has the same structure as the norm Nmixed(r), but appreciably more complex. Finally, dividing Imixed,mm(r) byNmixed(r) we obtain the probabilities pm(r) plotted in the Figures 4 and 5."

            "text": "In the main text we showed that, for a fixed coarse-graining map \u039b and fixed effective state %, the assignments when employing pure or mixed priors are in general different \u2013 with the exception of the partial trace map. This conclusion can be visually apprehended, for instance, from Figs. 2 and 7. For \u039bBnS the analytical evaluation of the trace distance between Apure\u039bBnS(%) and A mixed \u039bBnS\n(%) is presented in AppendixC. In the above discussion it was, nevertheless, assumed that the effective state % could be perfectly prepared, which of course it is not the case in a realistic scenario. Two points could then be raised: i) How close the error-free analytical assignment A\u039b is from the one obtained when preparation errors are allowed? ii) Does the difference between the assigned states for pure and mixed priors prevail when errors in the preparation of % are allowed?\nTo address these points, we extended the definition of the set of states that abide by the constraints, as to allow for a preparation error :\n\u2126 \u039b(%) = {\u03c8 \u2208 L(HD) | ||\u039b(\u03c8)\u2212 %||1 \u2264 }. (E1)\nWe then proceed by the way of a simple Rejection Sampling algorithm: for fixed %, \u039b and , we uniformly sampled a large number (to be specified later) of states in L(HD) and checked which ones belong to \u2126 \u039b(%). With the ones that are selected, we estimate the assigned state with preparation error as the average state, A \u039b[%] = \u2126 \u039b(%).\nNumerically, we generated a database of 106 pure 2 qubits states, and 106 pure 3 qubits states, sampled from their respective Haar measure. These databases were used both for \u039bBnS and \u039bJ=3/2. With the two qubit sample we obtained A ,pure\u039bBnS and A ,pure\u039bJ=3/2 for selected effective states (see below). With the database of 3 qubits, after performing the partial trace on the third qubit, we estimatedA ,mixed\u039bBnS andA ,mixed \u039bJ=3/2\n. In all cases we set the preparation error as = 0.025.\nFigures 10 and 11 summarize the obtained results. In both plots, the blue bars (left bar for each point in the horizontal axis) quantify the total difference between the analytical expression and the ones obtained numerically, i.e., for each % it equals ||A ,pure\u039b [%]\u2212A pure \u039b [%]||1 + ||A ,mixed \u039b [%]\u2212Amixed\u039b [%]||1. The orange bars (right bar for each point in the horizontal axis) quantify the difference between the pure and mixed prior analytical states for each %, i.e., ||Apure\u039b [%]\u2212Amixed\u039b [%]||1.\nThis choice of presentation allows us to address both raised points. From the small values obtained for the blue bars we observe that the analytical error-free results are close to the ones when preparation errors are allowed. By comparing the height of the orange bars with the blue ones, we appreciate\n17\n\u039b [%]\u2212A\nmixed\n\u039b [%]||1; while the\norange bars quantify the distance between the error-free analytical results, ||Apure\u039b [%] \u2212 A mixed \u039b [%]||1. The horizontal axis represents the index of the effective state \u2013 see table I.\n\u039b [%]\u2212A\nmixed\n\u039b [%]||1; while the\norange bars quantify the distance between the error-free analytical results, ||Apure\u039b [%] \u2212 A mixed \u039b [%]||1. The horizontal axis represents the Bloch vector length r of the effective state.\nthat the estimated average states with error are closer to their respective analytical result, than the distance between the analytical results for pure and mixed priors. In other words, the pure and mixed prior assigned states could be distinguished even if preparation errors are allowed.\nAs can be seen from the plot for \u039bBnS, Fig. 10, for all randomly selected states (see Table I) the total error is always much smaller than the difference between the error-free analytical results. That confirms that when preparation errors are allowed, the assigned state does not change appreciably, and that pure and mixed prior assignments can be distinguished.\nFor \u039bJ, Fig. 11, as expected, the difference between the error-free pure and mixed priors is small for almost pure effective states (r ' 1), and highly mixed effective states (r ' 0). For such cases, the preparation error might not permit the distinction between pure and mixed prior assignments. This distinction is however possible for intermediate purity effective states. In all the cases, given the small size of the blue bars, the assigned states when = 0.025 are close to the ones when = 0.\n18\n[1] E. T. Jaynes. Information theory and statistical mechanics. Phys.
