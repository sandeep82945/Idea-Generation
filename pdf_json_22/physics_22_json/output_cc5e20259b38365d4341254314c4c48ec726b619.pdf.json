INTRODUCTION\nGate-based quantum computers are promising platforms to realize a wide range of arbitrary unitary matrices not accessible via classical computers due mostly to memory-size restrictions. The fundamental idea is that any unitary operator U can be decomposed as a series of products of smaller unitary operations, known as quantum gates, which can be directly implemented on a quantum computer. A unitary operator U is then equivalent to a quantum circuit constructed from those quantum gates. An approach being considered is a parametric quantum circuit (PQC), where a series of adjustable (parametric) quantum gates results in a unitary matrix with parameters y, namely, U(y). Given a quantum computer, the natural question is what can be computed and how to instruct the machine, that is, which quantum algorithm to use. A major class of quantum algorithms for state preparation is based on the variational principle [1]. The idea is to minimize a cost function such that U(y) |r\u3009 closely approximates a target state |\u03c8\u3009 for a suitable initial state |r\u3009. Algorithms in this class are generally referred to as a variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) [2]. In the current era of noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) processors [3], VQAs are considered less costly in terms of circuit depth. However, it is still unclear how to choose and design the arrangement of PQC gates in general and how to avoid the appearance of barren plateaus during the optimization process [4, 5]. There is growing interest in quantum algorithms that are based instead on classical imaginary-time evolution\n\u2217 Corresponding author, email: jouzdanip@fusion.gat.com\n(ITE). The basic idea is to replace the real time t with an imaginary time \u03c4 = it, so that the initial state is projected onto the ground state with exponential accuracy. Since ITE is a non-unitary evolution, direct implementation on a quantum computer is impossible. Recently, the variational principle was used to optimize a PQC [6, 7] such that the ITE is replicated by a unitary evolution of the quantum circuit. In an other attempt [8], a quantum version of ITE (named QITE) was introduced where quantum gates are chosen at every time step. Others approaches utilize ancillary qubits where the algorithm operates on the probability of measuring a correct outcome [9, 10]. Efforts to further compress the quantum circuit have been reported as well [11, 12].\nApplications of ITE in physics and chemistry are many, from directly finding the ground state of a target Hamiltonian to the computation of the energy spectra, which can be achieved by quantum and Krylov subspace [8] expansions. The implementation of ITE on quantum computers would also allow the computation of Green\u2019s functions [13], the biggest bottleneck in dynamical meanfield theory calculations [14]. This possibility has motivated the pursue of hybrid quantum-classical simulations of correlated materials [15\u201317].\nIn this paper, we propose a modified implementation of ITE. Our proposal is inspired by the QITE of Ref. [8], but with a major modification that circumvents the main challenge of that method. In QITE, a quantum circuit U\u03c4 is used to connect an initial state |0\u3009 to the final state |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 that would have resulted from an imaginary time evolution, namely, |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 = U\u03c4 |0\u3009. In other words, the imaginary time evolution is replaced by an equivalent unitary operation. To obtain the quantum state at a time \u03c4 + \u03b4, |\u03c8\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009, an additional quantum circuit U\u03b4 must be\n2 found and applied to U\u03c4 |0\u3009, that is, |\u03c8\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 = U\u03b4 |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 = U\u03b4 U\u03c4 |0\u3009 . (1) The challenge is to identify the gates involved in U\u03b4 and the corresponding parameters. The authors of Ref. [8] propose the following solution to the above challenge: Consider the difference between the two states |d\u03c8\u3009 = |\u03c8\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 \u2212 |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009, which is known in terms of the Hamiltonian and |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009. Assume a unitary U\u03b4 comprising of a set of parametric gates. These gates are limited in number due to a bounded correlation length. Once U\u03b4 is chosen, U\u03b4 |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 \u2212 |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 is expanded and set equal to |d\u03c8\u3009. Ultimately, by solving a set of linear equations on a classical computer the gate parameters are found. A major drawback of this method is that the matrix dimensions of this linear system of equations are not in general bounded and can easily exceed a classical computer capacity. In addition, in Ref. [8] |d\u03c8\u3009 is expressed in terms of a set of non-orthogonal and incomplete eigenvectors, making the solution of the linear system of equations difficult. A simple solution to avoid non-orthogonality is to append U\u03b4 differently: Consider swapping U\u03c4 and U\u03b4 in Eq. (1), that is,\n|\u03c8\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 = U\u03c4 U\u03b4 |0\u3009 = U\u03c4+\u03b4 |0\u3009 . (2)\nBy properly choosing the gates in U\u03b4, the expansion of U\u03b4 |0\u3009 can be found to be a sum of orthogonal states, which, consequently, results in an expansion of |\u03c8\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 in terms of some orthogonal basis. More specifically, this is accomplished by considering U\u03b4 = e\niyjPj , where Pj is a Pauli string operator, and by starting with a state |0\u3009 that is a product of individual qubit states. In the following sections, we outline the algorithm that identifies the gate parameter set y = {yj} and the corresponding set {Pj} of operators in U\u03b4 at every step of the evolution. We also show that, in this approach, there is no need to solve linear equations off-line or on a classical computer. Additionally, the necessary gates are naturally obtained and there is no requirement of locality of the Hamiltonian or bounded correlation length. Our algorithm is a modified version of QITE, and thus we call it MQITE. Our algorithm does make a few assumptions. It assumes that it is possible to measure an \u03b7 number of state vector components at every time step. The number \u03b7 is a function of \u03b4, the imaginary-time increment, and \u01eb, the desired precision in the measurement. For most examples we studied, \u03b7 is of order of n or n2, where n is the number of qubits. Generally implementing an algorithm that replicates an ITE on a quantum computer requires deep quantum circuits. In this paper, we assume that the quantum computer is noise-free and the decoherence time is long enough to allow for long-depth circuits, which may not yet be achievable in most NISQ device implementations at the moment.\nDefinitions and notations used in the paper are outlined in Sec. II. Readers familiar with those aspects may skip to Sec. III for a detailed presentation of the MQITE and its steps. In Sec. IV, numerical examples are provided. We show the efficiency of the algorithm for a range of problems, including a classical spin problems on arbitrary graphs, the so-called Max-Cut problem [18], as well as the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), and finally the configuration-interaction nuclear shell model in occupation space. A summary and an outlook are provided in Sec. V. A subroutine for the decomposition of the many-qubit gate used in the algorithm is provided in Appendix A. A sub-algorithm to compute the number of state vector components \u03b7 is presented in Appendix B."

A Pauli string operator P is a tensor product of Pauli operators {X,Y, Z} and the identity I. Specifically,\nPj = O (j) 1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297O(j)n , (3)\nwhere n is the number of qubits and O(j) \u2208 {X,Y, Z, I}. A Pauli string operator is Hermitian and unitary, that is, P = P \u2020 and (P )2 = I1 \u2297 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2297 In = I\u2297n. We may use Pauli string operator and Pauli string interchangeably. A Hamiltonian is considered to be a sum of Pauli string operators and thus defined by its set of Pauli strings and the corresponding coefficients. Thus a Hamiltonian H , defined over n qubits, is written as a weighted sum of all Pauli string operators (the identity included),\nH = \u2211\nk\nwkQk, (4)\nwhere Qk is a Pauli string and the weight wk is a real number. A unitary operator eiyjPj can be expressed as\neiyjPj = cos yj I \u2297n + i sin yj Pj , (5)\nwhere y is a real parameter. Throughout this paper, i is reserved for the imaginary number i = \u221a \u22121. Each unitary eiyjPj can be shown to be implemented by O(2n) one- and two-qubit gates on a fully-connected quantum device A. A generic unitary operator acting on n qubits is\nU = U(y)\n= ei \u22114n\u22121 j=1 yjPj ; Pj 6= I\u2297N , (6)\nwhere the exclusion of the identity ensures det(U) = 1. On gate-based quantum computers, any unitary operation is decomposed into smaller unitary gates which\n3 operate on only one or two qubits, at most. A usual way to decompose an arbitrary U is by performing trotterization:\nU = ( ei \u22114n\u22121 j=1 \u03b4jPj )m\u03c4\n\u2248\n\n\nnu \u220f\nj=1\nei\u03b4jPj\n\n\nm\u03c4 ,\n, (7)\nwhere nu is at most 4 n \u2212 1, m\u03c4 is the assumed number of trotterization steps, and \u03b4j = yj/m\u03c4 . Notice the approximate nature of Eq. (7), as the Pauli strings Pj do not necessarily commute. The error incurred in the approximation is O(m\u03c4 \u03b4 2 j )."

QITE, introduced in Ref. [8], is an attempt to replicate the ITE state at every time increment in the evolution process. Explicitly, one is interested in finding the unitary ei \u2211 j yjPj such that\ne\u2212\u03b4 H |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 ||e\u2212\u03b4 H |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 || = ei \u2211 j yjPj |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 (8)\nfor a small \u03b4. In the case when H = Q is a single Pauli string, and after expanding both sides of this equation, one arrives at a set of linear equations which is directly associated to the correlations \u3008\u03c8\u03c4 |PjPj\u2032 |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009. Upon solving the system of equations, the parameters yj are determined. However, the linear equations do not specify the set of {Pj} in Eq. (8). These operators are postulated based on the relevant correlation length in the problem, and recently suggested to be determined by combinatorial analysis [12] and other considerations [19]. The equations for a generic set of {Pj} may have a non-zero nullspace, and may require a generalized inversion method or an iterative algorithm such as conjugate gradient in order to be solved. This shortcoming of QITE is a direct consequence of the expansion of |\u03c8\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 in terms of an incomplete and non-orthogonal basis set, which in turn is due to the correlations amongst operators. To understand this point, consider the first-order expansion\nei \u2211 j yjPj |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 \u2248 |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009+ \u2211\nj\nyj |\u03c6j\u3009 , (9)\nwhere |\u03c6j\u3009 = iPj |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 and, in general, \u3008\u03c6j |\u03c6j\u2032 \u3009 6= 0. A similar situation arises in classical techniques based on neural networks that have been recently used to obtain the ground state of many-body quantum systems\n[20]. Within that context, the non-orthogonality was suggested to be associated with the geometry of the Hilbert space [21], but can in fact be traced back to the stochastic reconfiguration method of Sorella et al. [22]. One of the purported advantages of using a quantum computer and quantum algorithms is to avoid complications that exist in classical techniques such as the one noted. In this paper, with a simple rearrangement of factors, we arrive at an incomplete but orthogonal basis set {|\u03bej\u3009}. Due to this orthogonality, no correlations exist and the parameter values come directly from measurements in the quantum circuit."

(10)\nAs before, U\u03c4 is a known unitary that has been identified in the previous steps of the algorithm such that |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 = U\u03c4 |0\u3009. In contrast to Eq. (8), U\u03b4 appears to the right of U\u03c4 . Q is a single Pauli string operator. The initial state |0\u3009 = |01, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0n\u3009 is a product state. Upon expansion of the above,\n|\u03c8\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 \u2248 |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009+ i \u2211\nj\nyj U\u03c4 Pj |0\u3009\n\u2248 |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009+ \u2211\nj\nyj U\u03c4 |j\u3009\n\u2248 |\u03be0(\u03c4)\u3009+ \u2211\nj\nyj |\u03bej(\u03c4)\u3009 , (11)\nwhere |j\u3009 = iPj |0\u3009 is a computational basis state (by construction) and |\u03bej(\u03c4)\u3009 = U\u03c4 |j\u3009. The notable difference from the original QITE formulation is that \u3008\u03bej\u2032 (\u03c4)|\u03bej(\u03c4)\u3009 = \u3008j\u2032|j\u3009 = \u03b4j\u2032j if we choose a set {Pj} of Pauli string operators in Eq. (10) such that the generated bit strings {|j\u3009} are distinct. As a result, {|\u03bej(\u03c4)\u3009} is an orthogonal basis set. At first glance, Eq. (11) may suggest that there could be an exponential number of components to be evaluated. This is unlikely from a physical standpoint: Consider evolving the initial state |0\u3009 by a propagator U\u03c4 , then perturb the system by Q (a Pauli string) that could be interpreted physically as an external field, and finally evolve back to time \u03c4 = 0 with the propagator U\u2212\u03c4 = U \u2020 \u03c4 . At this time, the state should not significantly differ from |0\u3009, that is, the projection of the state outside of |0\u3009 should be small. This means, in an active picture, the state |\u03c8\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 differs from |\u03be0(\u03c4)\u3009 = |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 by some limited\n4 number of components, captured by projecting onto some limited eigenvectors {|\u03bej(\u03c4)\u3009 = U\u03c4 |j\u3009}, with j 6= 0. Based on this physical consideration, expanding Eq. (10) and multiplying both sides by U \u2020\u03c4 we arrive at\n|0\u3009 \u2212 \u03b4U \u2020\u03c4QU\u03c4 |0\u3009 n\u03c4 = |0\u3009+ i \u2211\nj\nyj Pj |0\u3009 .\n(12)\nHere, n\u03c4 is a normalization factor,\nn\u03c4 =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 2\u03b4 \u30080|U \u2020\u03c4 QU\u03c4 |0\u3009+ \u03b42. (13)\nAfter a Taylor expansion of n\u22121\u03c4 up to the order \u03b4, and inserting it in Eq. (12), we arrive at\n\u2212i \u2211\nj\nyj Pj |0\u3009 = \u03b4 \u2211\nj 6=0\n|j\u3009 \u3008j|U \u2020\u03c4 QU\u03c4 |0\u3009\n= \u03b4 \u2211\nj 6=0\ncj |j\u3009 (14)\nNotice that the state U \u2020\u03c4 QU\u03c4 |0\u3009 can be prepared on a quantum computer since U and Q are unitary. By preparing and executing this circuit a \u03c7 number of times and measuring qubits in the computational basis, a distribution over the bit-strings |j = 0\u3009 to |j = 2n \u2212 1\u3009 is obtained. Essentially, from the right-hand side (RHS) of Eq. (14), for every bit string |j\u3009, observed after measurements in a quantum computer, a Pauli string operator Pj can be construct to satisfy the left-hand-side (LHS) of the same equation. Pj generates |j\u3009 upon acting on |0\u3009. This allows us to relate the coefficient cj to the gate parameter yj . In practice, cj is in general a complex number while yj is a real parameter. Therefore, we assign two Pauli string operators to every single j bit-string: P (r) j |0\u3009 = i |j\u3009 and P (i) j |0\u3009 = |j\u3009. If the RHS of Eq. (14) is considered as a 2n \u00d7 1 vector \u2211\nj |cj | ei\u03b8j |j\u3009, after \u03c7 times running and sampling the quantum processor, there are at most \u03b7 \u2264 \u03c7 nonzero entries (i.e., bit strings), with \u03b7 \u226a 2n. Therefore, it is computationally inexpensive to design a set of measurements and obtain both the amplitude |cj | (already obtained from measurement in Z basis) and the phase \u03b8j , for all the \u03b7 observed j bit-strings. For more details see Appendix B. From Eq. (14) we can directly relate the real and imaginary parts of the coefficients cj to the gate parameters yj \u2019s. Explicitly:\ny (r) j = \u03b4 c (r) j (15)\nand\ny (i) j = \u2212\u03b4 c (i) j , (16)\nwhere y (r) j and y (i) j are the parameters associated with the Pauli operators P (r) j and P (i) j , respectively.

Next, one replaces U\u03c4 with U\u03c4+\u03b4 = U\u03c4U\u03b4, and proceed to the next step. The complete steps of the algorithm are shown in Fig. 1. A different derivation of Eqs (15) and (16) is provided in appendix C which takes the same approach as in [8], which is done by introducing a cost function based on the difference between the unitary and non-unitary evolved states. In contrast, we show in Appendix B that Eq. (10) for the unitary evolution does not require solving equations on a classical computer. In most real-world applications, the initial state is a product state. In quantum chemistry and for most fermionic problems the initial state is a Hartree-Fock state represented in terms of a second-quantized state (i.e., a Fock state). In spin problems such as Max-Cut, the initial state is one possible configuration of the vertices. It is straightforward to adjust the formalism introduced here to a case where the initial state is determined from |0\u3009 by some unitary transformation Um; \u2223 \u22230\u0303 \u232a\n= Um |0\u3009. This corresponds to initializing U as U = Um instead of U = I [see Fig. 1, line 1]."

(14), the circuit U \u2020QU |0\u3009 is executed \u03c7 times on a quantum computer; see lines 6-9. The outcome of measuring the qubits in the computational Z-basis is a distribution over bit strings |j\u3009. The circuit is executed \u03c7 \u2248 O(102\u01eb) times.\nThere are \u03b7 \u2264 \u03c7 number of components in U \u2020QU |0\u3009 that are dominant.

We assume the dominant components to correspond to the largest observed probabilities within the considered precision (or number of executions).

The \u03b7 bit strings with largest probabilities, or, equivalently, with largest amplitudes, are recorded for next steps; see lines 8 and 10.\nLines 12-18 compute the real and imaginary parts of cj for every observed j. For this purpose, further quantum circuit executions and instructions are needed (see line 13) for each j in order to compute all \u03b7 real and imaginary parts. A possible approach is introduced in Appendix B.\nOn line 17, unitary operators eiy (r) j P (r) j and eiy (i) j P (i) j are prepared in terms of one- and two-qubit gates, and are appended to the current circuit U . Implementation of eiy (r/i) j P (r/i) j in terms of elementary gates, under assumption of fully connected hardware, is straightforward and provided in Appendix A. Each unitary operator eiy (r/i) j P (r/i) j adds a maximum of O(2n) to the circuit\ndepth. In Fig. 1, the circuit parameters yj are computed more generally, i.e., beyond the first order in \u03b4 [compare lines 15 and 16 with Eqs.

The P (i)j satisfies P\n(i) j |0\u3009 = |j\u3009. P (r) j is constructed by replacing one\nX operator with Y . Finally, on line 19, the quantum circuit instruction is updated. The algorithm proceeds to the next (w,Q). Once all the terms inH are accounted for, |\u03c8\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 = U |0\u3009 is an approximation to e\u2212\u03b4H |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 that is obtained by unitary evolution from initial state |0\u3009. At this stage the relevant observables such as the total energy expectation value can be computed; see line 21."

In this ideal situation, only two steps are involved: (1) non-unitary propagation |\u03c6\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 = e\u2212\u03b4H |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 and (2) the normalization |\u03c8\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 = |\u03c6\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 /|| |\u03c6\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 ||. The ITE algorithm consists of m\u03c4 iterations over these two steps. By expanding |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 in the exact eigenstate basis of H , it is straightforward to show that |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 converges to the exact ground state (or a superposition of degenerate groundstates) when \u03c4\u22121 \u226a \u2206E , where \u2206E is the minimum gap between ground state and excited state energies of the Hamiltonian. Therefore,\nm\u03c4 \u226b 1\n\u2206E \u03b4 (17)\nmust be satisfied for a given (fixed) value of \u03b4. In an ideal scenario where e\u2212\u03b4H can be implemented with O(1) resources, this means that a circuit depth of at least O ( (\u2206E \u03b4) \u22121 ) is expected.\nIn practice, e\u2212\u03b4H must be discretized into pieces, a process known as trotterization:\ne\u2212\u03b4H \u2248 e\u2212\u03b41Q1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 e\u2212\u03b4nHQnH , (18)\nwhere \u03b4k = \u03b4 wk. The above is not exact since \u03b4k\u03b4k\u2032 [Qk, Qk\u2032 ] 6= 0 for most of Qk and Qk\u2032 in H , and therefore e\u2212\u03b4kQk \u2212\u03b4k\u2032Qk\u2032 6= e\u2212\u03b4kQk e\u2212\u03b4k\u2032Qk\u2032 . The missing terms on the RHS of Eq. (18) result in fluctuations around the ideal expected outcome e\u2212\u03b4H |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 /||e\u2212\u03b4H |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 || at every time step. We refer to these fluctuation as quantum fluctuations and denote the associated energy scale \u2013 the uncertainty in energy due to these fluctuation \u2013 by \u2206qfl. For a fixed \u03b4, the energy uncertainty \u2206qfl is not a function of number of steps m\u03c4 . Therefore, even if Eq. (17) is satisfied (for a fixed \u03b4)\n6 the quantum fluctuation can still induce an overlap with excited states. There are two ways to reduce \u2206qfl. First, one can decrease \u03b4. Since Eq. (17) must be simultaneously satisfied, a larger m\u03c4 is then required. Second, one can keep \u03b4 fixed but perform a higher-order trotterization, which adds more terms to the expansion of e\u2212\u03b4H and thus increases the circuit depth as well. For either way, quantum fluctuations are reduced at the expense of increasing circuit depth. Notice that in this analysis the impact of the initial state on \u2206qfl is not considered. In order to quantify the circuit depth at a fixed \u03b4 for a first-order trotterization, we need to access the required number of gates to implement e\u2212\u03b4 Q U |0\u3009. From Sec. III A, we know that exactly 2\u03b7 unitary operators are required and must be appended to the quantum circuit U , namely, U\u03b4k = [eiy (r) j1 P (r) j1 . eiy (i) j1 P (i) j1 ] \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 [eiy (r) j\u03b7 P (r) j\u03b7 . e iy (i) j\u03b7 P (i) j\u03b7 ] (see Fig. 1). Since each unitary operator eiy (r/i) j P (r/i) j needs at most 2n elementary gates (see Appendix A), 4\u03b7n elementary gates are added to the current quantum circuit U in order to implement e\u2212\u03b4QU |0\u3009. Furthermore, there are nH terms in H and thus a total number of\nngates = O(4\u03b7nnH) (19)\ngates per imaginary time step are added to the quantum circuit. While the above estimate is exact, the value \u03b7 is yet undefined. We conjecture that \u03b7 is a fraction of the full Hilbert space. This conjecture is based on the fact that the difference between the incrementally propagated state |\u03c8\u03c4+\u03b4\u3009 and |\u03c8\u03c4 \u3009 is not significant. Here we elaborate on this statement further. We then justify a cutoff value for \u03b7 based on the argument provided. As a result, a practical upper bound on the number of gates is obtained. The core task of the MQITE algorithm is to approximate U \u2020\u03c4 QU\u03c4 |0\u3009 at each imaginary time step, i.e., to determine the coefficients cj on the RHS of Eq. (14). We expect to need only few of these coefficients. To understand the reason, consider a local interaction Q (i.e., a Pauli string operator affecting only a small number of qubits). In this case, we expect Q |\u03be0(\u03c4)\u3009 = \u2211j=2n\nj=0 cj |\u03bej(\u03c4)\u3009 to result in a set of coefficients with amplitudes |cj | sharply distributed around a certain j\u22c6. Therefore, at finite precision, rather than including all 2n possible contributions to the sum, we need to consider only a small number of terms falling around the maximum of the distribution. In fact, at both short and large imaginary time limits, we expect the coefficients cj to be concentrated around a single j component. Consider the short-time regime \u03c4 = \u03b4 and a Hamiltonian H containing an O(n) number of local interactions. Because U\u03b4 \u2248 I, U \u2020\u03b4 H U\u03b4 |0\u3009 results in a superposition of very few other bit strings within a very short Hamming distance of the initial bit string j = 0. Thus the distribution of amplitudes |cj | is concen-\ntrated at around j = 0 in the beginning of the imaginary time evolution. At the opposite limit, at \u03c4 = \u221e, consider the state U \u2020\u221eH U\u221e |0\u3009. This state is also expected to involve a superposition very narrowly centered at |0\u3009 since, ideally, U\u221e |0\u3009 is the ground state of H . It is possible that along the path \u03c4 : 0 \u2192 \u221e the distribution of amplitudes |cj | broadens, deviating from what is observed at the two extreme limits. This behavior is captured by the dependence of the standard deviation of this distribution on the imaginary time \u03c4 . But there are other characteristics of the distribution that reveal additional information about the dominant number of components, \u03b7. These characteristics also can be used as performance metrics. A specific indicator is the difference between the largest |c\u22c6j | and the next largest amplitude for a given \u03c4 . We denote this quantity by \u2206\u22c6. In Sec. IVB, Fig. 4, it is shown that \u2206\u2217 clearly displays the transition from \u03c4 = 0 to \u03c4 = \u221e. In essence, the change in the statistics of amplitudes |cj | captures both thermal and quantum fluctuations.\nIn practice, the parameter \u03b7 is an input to the algorithm. We make the assumption that \u03b7 is a function of n, such as \u03b7 = \u03b1nd, where d and \u03b1 are constants. Thus \u03b7 plays the role of a cutoff and the number of gates can be upper bounded by\nngates = O(4nd+1nH) (20)\nat any \u03c4 .\nGiven \u03b7, to achieve a precision 10\u2212\u01eb, we estimate (see Appendix B 1) that \u03c7 \u2265 102\u01eb \u03b7 quantum circuit executions are needed, where \u01eb is the desired number of significant figures in the measurement of the amplitudes.\nIn Fig. 2, the evolution of the distribution of the amplitudes |cj(\u03c4)| is shown for the Max-Cut problem and the TFIM. These problems and the simulations are discussed in detail in Sec. IVB. Here the distribution of amplitudes |cj(\u03c4)| is associated to the last Q in H , that is, right before the loop on line 4 in Fig. 1 is complete. At this point, the quantum state U\u03c4 |0\u3009 represents closely e\u2212\u03c4H |0\u3009 /||e\u2212\u03c4H |0\u3009 ||. At the boundary \u03c4 = \u03b4, the distribution is sharply centered on a single j index for both problems. As the evolution continues, the distribution spreads over up to \u03b7 components. In these simulations, we set \u03b7 = 100 = n2.\nAt \u03c4 = 3, the maximum \u03c4 in these simulations, it is shown that the distribution {|cj(\u03c4)|} narrows and peaks at j = 0 again. For Max-Cut, where all the operators in H commute, there distribution is more concentrated around a well-defined value. In the TFIM problem, due to non-commutation of the terms in H , there is a wider spreading. The latter is a consequence of the quantum fluctuations, where the uncertainty in energy allows some components of excited states to appear even at large \u03c4 (with fixed \u03b4)."

            "text": "In order to verify and demonstrate the MQITE algorithm, three different aspects are studied numerically. All calculations are implemented using using the IBM Qiskit package [23]. The first aspect relates to whether the algorithm presented in Appendix B 1 can accurately compute the real and imaginary parts of a given cj component. The second aspect is to test the algorithm on two toy problems that are frequently explored in literature, namely, Max-Cut and the TFIM, with a focus on the number of gates needed per time step. Finally, the last aspect concerns the application of the algorithm to a nuclear physics problem. In this problem, the Hamiltonian consists of Pauli strings that are not k-local, where k-local is defined by having any Pauli string operator Q in H to have at most k operators from the set {X,Y, Z}, that is Q acting on at most on k qubits. The list of the Pauli string operators {Q} and corresponding weights {w} included in the Hamiltonian of this problem are tabulated in Appendix D. The translations from a secondquantized Hamiltonian to Pauli string operators are performed by a Jordan-Wigner transformation [24].\nA. Validation of the Phase Estimation:\nIn this numerical study, the goal is to illustrate that through the sub-algorithm presented in Appendix B one can estimate the phase \u03b8 of a component such as cj = |cj |ei\u03b8j = \u3008j|U \u2020QU |0\u3009, or, equivalently, its real and imaginary parts c\n(r) j and c (i) j , respectively.\nA circuit represented by U \u2020QU is prepared using Qiskit at every \u03c4 and for every Q operator. The circuit is then executed \u03c7 = 100 times. For every execution, the qubits are measured in the Z-computational basis and a bit string j is recorded. After \u03c7 executions, a set of bit strings is identified; this is the set {j}. Let \u03b7 = |{j}| be the number of observed components. The maximum value of \u03b7 through the entire simulation is \u03b7max = 7, which is much less than the \u03c7 = 100 shots used in the experiment. In the simulation, we obtain the value |cj | for every j in the observed bit strings from the state vector representation of U \u2020QU |0\u3009, and round this value to 10\u2212\u01eb precision. We note that to have |cj | determined with a precision of 10\u22123 requires \u03c7 \u223c O(106) circuit calls. The sets {|cj|} and {j} are used to obtain the real and imaginary parts (the phases) as explained in Appendix B: For each j component a separate circuit is prepared and executed \u03c7 times. However, since the number of runs necessary to reach the a desired precision (e.g., \u01eb = 2) are too many given our computational resources, a smaller\n8 number of runs is used instead, and the amplitudes are read directly from the state vector and then rounded to precision \u01eb, thus mimicking the results that would be obtained following the measurement-based procedure. The Hamiltonian is generated from 3-local interactions for a 6-qubit system. Thus every Q acts on half of the qubits. The Q operators are generated randomly from the set {I,X, Y }. The Hamiltonian has the form\nH = J (0.961XXY III + 0.853 Y IY IIY\n+ 0.137 Y IXY II + 0.980XIIIXY\n+ 0.712 Y IIIY X + 0.962XIY Y II) (21)\nThroughout the simulation \u03b4 = 0.3/J is used. Figure 3a displays the difference between the computed ground state energy of the Hamiltonian and the exact value (\u22123.118J) as a function of the imaginary time for both ITE and MQITE. Both methods reach an accuracy of a few percent. Notice that the gap between the computed and the exact ground state energies tends to stabilize for both methods, an effect mainly due to the trotterization of the evolution. The gap is twice as large for MQITE, in part due to finite number of quantum measurement samples. Figures 3b,c show the real and imaginary parts of the components of the ITE state vector \u2223\n\u2223\u03c8ITE\u03c4 \u232a =\ne\u2212\u03c4H |0\u3009 /||e\u2212\u03c4H |0\u3009 || and corresponding MQITE state vector \u2223\n\u2223\u03c8MQITE\u03c4 \u232a = \u2211 j |j\u3009 \u3008j|U\u03c4 |0\u3009 at the last imaginary-time evolution step of the simulation (\u03c4 = 3/J). Notice that only very few components are non zero. Real and imaginary parts obtained from the two methods match very closely. Throughout the entire simulation the fidelity between the ITE and the MQITE state vectors stays above 0.998."

            "text": "In the following studies, two model problems are considered. The objective of the numerical experiments in this section is to show that the MQITE evolution matches with high fidelity the ITE evolution, ensuring that MQITE performs as well as the classical ITE method. Max-Cut.\u2013 The Max-Cut problem is to find the partitioning of a graph that maximizes the number of edges between the two partition. The problem maps onto a system of classical spins on a graph, where each spin interacts with k other spins. An interaction is represented by an edge, and a spin by a vertex on a graph G with a cost function given by\nH = \u2211\n(tq)\u2208G\nJtq xt xq, (22)\nwhere the weight Jtq is the interaction strength between the spins at the vertexes t and q on the graphG. The classical spin x takes the discrete values {\u22121, 1}. The ground\nstate is a classical configuration of the spin variables; the edges between spins with opposite values represent a cut in the graph. The objective of the problem is to find the energy of the ground state. A quantum circuit solution to this problem was studied in Ref. [12], where the number of gates per time step was estimated to scale combinatorially with the number of bits n. To study this problem with a quantum algorithm, the x variables are replaced by Pauli operators. In our study, each x is replaced by a Pauli operator X . We randomly generated a graph with the property that each vertex is exactly linked to k vertices; we set k = 3. The weights Jtq are chosen randomly and uniformly from the interval [0, J ]. TFIM.\u2013 We also study the well-known TFIM problem in one dimension. The Hamiltonian is given by\nH = \u2212J n\u22121 \u2211\nt=1\nZtZt+1 + hx\nn \u2211\nt=1\nXt. (23)\nIn our numerical studies, we set hx = J , corresponding to the quantum critical point between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic ground states. Results.\u2013 For both Max-Cut and the TFIM, n = 10 qubits were used. A circuit U \u2020QU was prepared using Qiskit and applied \u03c7 = 1000 times to the initial state |0\u3009. The observed set of {j} bit strings corresponding to the first \u03b7 largest amplitudes |cj | was recorded for each value of \u03c4 . As noted earlier, for practical reasons, the amplitudes were computed directly from the state vectors instead of setting |cj | = \u221a\nnj/\u03c7, where nj is the number of times the bit string j is observed after \u03c7 executions of the circuit. The phases were also read off from the state vector and rounded to maintain 10\u2212\u01eb precision, with \u01eb = 2, although the results are not sensitive significantly to the choice of \u01eb. \u03b7 was bounded by n2 in these simulations. In the case of Max-Cut, the largest observed number of bit strings was 51 for \u03c7 = 1000 and at \u03c4 = 0.7/J . In the case of the TFIM, the number was 38 at \u03c4 = 2.9/J . The results of the numerical calculations are shown in Fig. 4 As Figs. 4a,d show, the difference between the calculated and the exact ground state energies for the MQIT follows closely that for the ITE. We observe a slower convergence in the case of the TFIM for the considered values of \u03b4 and T . The slow convergence relates primarily to quantum fluctuation that emerges as a result of the trotterization. We have verified that the convergence improves upon either reducing \u03b4 or employing higher-order trotterization. Any further discrepancy between ITE and the MQITE is solely due to the algorithm itself. The most important source of such errors is the way the \u03b7 components are selected after \u03c7 executions. We choose the first \u03b7 components with the largest |cj | values, as justified in previous sections. Errors intrinsic to MQITE require further investigations. The initial state of the qubits can improve the convergence of an ITE simulation, but may increase the number of terms in the set {j} observed bit strings in MQITE. This increase in circuit depth was observed in\nthe case of the TFIM when the initial stated was replaced by (|0\u3009 \u00b1 |1\u3009 / \u221a 2.\nAs argued in Sec. III C, we expect the distribution of amplitudes |cj | to follow a particular dynamics. At the two extremes, \u03c4 = 0 and \u03c4 = \u221e, ideally, this distribution is narrowly concentrated at j = 0. To illustrate this point, we define \u2206\u22c6 as the difference between the largest observed amplitude, |c\u22c6j |, and the next largest amplitude in the distribution. Thus, we expect to obtain \u2206\u22c6 \u2248 1 at \u03c4 = 0 and \u03c4 = \u221e. Between these two extremes, the distribution is expected to broaden and thus \u2206\u22c6 < 1. The larger the number of bit string j observed, the smaller the value of \u2206\u22c6. In Figs. 4b,e, the difference 1 \u2212 \u2206\u22c6 is plotted versus imaginary the time. For Max-Cut this quantity is nearly zero at both ends of the evolution, with a relatively sharp peak developing at intermediate times. For the TFIM the same quantity evolves slower, with broad maximum and a wider tail at long times.\nFigures 4c,f show the number of gates added to the circuit at every time step divided by the number of terms in the Hamiltonian. The gate count is obtained from the Qiskit package and it agrees with the estimate that for every eiyjPj operator used, there is approximately 2n elementary gates from the set {Rx, Ry, Rz, CNOT }. Here it is assumed that CNOT gates between any two qubits are possible.\nIn addition to MQITE, one can apply the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) introduced in Refs. [8, 25] (named QLanczos) to improve the accuracy of the ground state computation. This requires saving the circuit instruction of U\u03c4 at all time steps, namely, saving the set {(yj(\u03c4), Pj(\u03c4))} for all \u03c4 . This post-processing step requires solving a generalized eigenvalue problem using the correlation matrix C\u03c4,\u03c4 \u2032 = \u30080|U \u2020\u03c4 U\u03c4 \u2032 |0\u3009, and an effective Hamiltonian. The effective Hamiltonian is defined within the Krylov subspace of {U\u03c4 |0\u3009} as Heff\u03c4,\u03c4 \u2032 = \u30080|U \u2020\u03c4 H U\u03c4 \u2032 |0\u3009, where H is the original Hamiltonian of the problem. Technical details can be found in the literature [19, 26, 27] and are not provided in this paper. This quantum subspace expansion approach compliments ITE algorithm. In Figs. 4a,d, MQITE+QSE indicates the result of QSE-enhanced computations. Provided that enough memory to store all intermediate values for {(yj(\u03c4), Pj(\u03c4))}, there is a clear gain in post-processing with QSE."

(24)\nThe matrix elements may encode important symmetries such as rotational invariance, but otherwise are not restricted, and hence the resulting matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in a many-body system is sparse but very nonlocal. In classical calculations, the low-lying eigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian are efficiently found through the Lanczos algorithm or some of its variants [29].\nSuch configuration interaction calculations have many attractive qualities: the method (aside from the num-\n11\nber of iterations to convergence) is not dependent upon the states or interaction having special properties; it is almost as easy to generate low-lying eigenstates as it is to generate the ground state; and it is not restricted to, for example, even or odd number of particles. The method is not, however, size-extensive, and the basis grows exponentially with the number of particles and/or the number of single-particle states. Because of this exponential growth, such number-occupation-based configuration-interaction calculations are obvious targets for quantum computation efforts.\nIn Fig. 5, we show results for two neutrons in the 0p shell, that is, with the 0p3/2 and 0p1/2 orbitals, which have a total of six single-particle states for protons and for neutrons, using the empirical Cohen-Kurath interaction [28]. Because such nuclear shell-model Hamiltonians are rotationally invariant, the eigenstates have good total angular momentum J ; for a given J , the eigenstates are degenerate in the z-component of angular momentum M . Hence, in classical calculations, one often works in the so-called M -scheme basis, where total M is fixed. We are able to apply this scheme here. Fig. 5a has an initial configuration of two neutrons in the 0p3/2 orbital; one neutron has initial m = +3/2 and the other has m = \u22123/2, hence the total M = 0. Under our simulation we recover the ground state which happens to have J = 0. In Fig. 5b, while the initial configuration\nstill is two neutrons in the 0p3/2 orbital, the m-values are +1/2,+3/2, and hence the total M = 2. Thus the system can only access states with total J \u2265 2 (which in this case is the highest angular momentum available), and which is an excited state. Overall, there is a quite good agreement between ITE and MQITE for this problem, and a tendency for convergence to even more accurate ground state energy values for longer imaginary times. However, deviations do appear at longer times. As one may expect, noise can cause mixing with states of different M ; we leave an investigation of this issue to future work."

            "heading": "V. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION",
            "text": "In this section, we provide some comments about MQITE, its shortcomings and possible improvements, and its applicability to a wider range of problems than those studied in this paper.\nIdeally, a quantum computer should do as much possible the computations that are hard for a classical computer. A hybrid quantum-classical design where some hard computations are performed classically is a less desirable solution. In the majority of variational quantum algorithms, the ansatz is a hypothesized parametric\n12\nquantum circuit (PQC). A PQC is inevitably limited to a subspace of the full Hilbert space of the problem. Thus, for a generic problem where the solution is not in the image of the hypothesized ansatz, a classical optimizer or solver, no matter how precise it is, will never find the solution.\nIn this paper a quantum algorithm for quantum state preparation is presented where the ansatz is not a hypothesized PQC to be optimized. In contrary, in our approach PQC is built gradually based on direct measurements by the quantum computer, and without any classical optimizer or solver. Our algorithm is specifically demonstrated to implement ITE on a quantum computer where the target quantum state is the ground state.\nIn general, variational quantum algorithms require optimization. Optimization of a PQC can be difficult, as the gate parameters are not in general independent. Our algorithm builds the circuit layer by layer in a way that parameters in each layer are uncorrelated by construction \u2013 a consequence of working with an orthogonal basis set {|\u03be\u3009} where each basis state has an associated gate parameter.\nSimilarly to QITE, MQITE can be used as basis for a subspace expansion to obtain excited states. One of the advantages of complementing the MQITE with the Lanczos algorithm is the ability to rapidly converge toward low-lying excited states. This is particular important in nuclear physics, where low-lying spectra and transitions reveal much about the structure of nuclei. Here, we illustrated this strategy for the Max-Cut and the TFIM; we leave its application to nuclear physics problems to a future work.\nOther potential application of the MQITE algorithm is in machine learning (ML). Generally speaking, a typical task in ML is classification and prediction on incoming data, when the ML model is trained on some historical data. The algorithm presented here is anticipated to facilitate the preparation of input data as part of an quantum ML program.\nAnother area of applicability is in fusion energy science where the objective are mostly simulation of flows of Navier-Stokes fluids and equations [30, 31]. Recently, a quantum algorithm was presented to simulates a single time step of a Navier-Stokes fluid using a quantum simulator [32]. In that simulation, at every time step the circuit was initialized to the quantum state obtained in the previous step. In our approach, working in a differ-\nent basis ({|\u03bej\u3009}) rather than in the computational basis allows us to control the increase in complexity from one step to another. We thus expect MQITE to be a useful tool for simulations in the fusion energy area of research. In the current version of the algorithm, at every time step, the most dominant components are deemed to be the ones that have the largest amplitudes. This assumption may be intuitive, but is not necessarily and generally correct in every situation. An ML-assisting software could possibly infer a better image of the distribution of amplitudes {cj} that is obtained from measuring U \u2020QU |0\u3009, and thus improve the accuracy of MQITE. In our studies, the effect of hardware errors were not considered. However, we specifically take into consideration the precision required in the quantum measurements to achieve a certain precision in the computation. The constraints on the measurements translate directly into gate parameters. Hence it is implicitly assumed that any one- and two-qubit quantum gate can be performed up to the desired precision. Intrinsic to the classical ITE approach and to trotterization, an increase in the number of imaginary time steps often results in an increase in circuit depth. The number of gates per time step in our algorithm is estimated to be polynomial in the system size (number of qubits) for a fixed, reasonable precision. Nevertheless, even if such a favorable scaling, since relatively large circuit depths are expected even for low precision, the MQITE algorithm is not suitable for current NISQ systems."

In this Appendix, we show a way to obtain these two quantities using only a quantum computer, i.e, without classical optimization, up to a precision 10\u2212\u01eb.\n1.

We define the unitary Tts = e\ni\u03c04 Pts , where Pts is a Pauli string operator comprised of X and I such that Pts |t\u3009 = |s\u3009, where s and t are bit strings. Tts can be implemented using the decomposition scheme introduced in Appendix A. Using Tts and Eq. (B1), consider\n|\u03c8\u2032\u3009 = Tj1j2 [ U \u2020QU |0\u3009 ]\n= ( 1\u221a 2 + i 1\u221a 2 Pj1j2)\n\n\n\u2211\nj\ncj |j\u3009\n\n\n= 1\u221a 2 (cj1 + icj2) |j1\u3009+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .

Since mj1 = (1/2)|cj1 + icj2 |2, where the amplitudes |cj1 | and |cj2 | are already known from the execution of |\u03c8\u3009 = U \u2020QU |0\u3009, by measuring mj1\n15\nthe relative phase \u03b8j1 \u2212 \u03b8j2 is obtained,\nsin (\u03b8j1 \u2212 \u03b8j2) = 2mj \u2212 |cj1 |2 \u2212 |cj2 |2\n2|cj1 ||cj2 | . (B4)\nFurthermore, assuming \u03b8j1 = 0, \u03b8j2 is obtained from the above equation. In order to obtain all {\u03b8j2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03b8j\u03b7}, the the above experiment is repeated \u03b7 \u2212 1 times, that is, \u03b7 \u2212 1 different quantum circuits are employed, each time with a different Tj1j operator, j \u2208 {j2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , j\u03b7}. While this approach is in principle sufficient for finding the phases, in practice we employed a modified approach. The objective for this modification is to avoid reliance on the relative phase between two phases \u03b8j1 and \u03b8j2 , for the reason that the original approach may result in different global phases from one iteration of the algorithm to the next; that is, the global phase of U \u2020QU |0\u3009 in the inner loop on line 4 of Fig. 1 varies. In theory this should not be an issue, but we have numerical evidence that this can be a source of error. Further investigation is needed to clarify this issue. The modified approach is to assign the zero phase to a component that is not present in the set of {cj}, in Eq. (B1). In other words, a j1 is chosen such that cj1 = 0\n(within the assumed precision), and for this bit string \u03b8j1 = 0 is assumed. However, a glance at Eq. (B4) reveals that this results in a divergence, unless the limit of cj1 \u2192 0+ is taken. W then have\nlim cj1\u21920 + 2mj \u2212 |cj1 |2 \u2212 |cj2 |2 2|cj1 ||cj2 | = c (i) j2 |cj2 | , (B5)\nwhich is equivalent to the sin (\u03b8j2). The limit cj1 \u2192 0+ can be implemented with a quantum circuit that utilizes an ancillary qubit, as we shown below. Imaginary Part.\u2013 Consider the circuit in Fig. 8. Here R\u03b3 is a rotation on the ancillary qubit, with \u03b3 being a small positive value. In practice, \u03b3 = 10\u2212\u01eb is used and R\u03b3 is defined such that R\u03b3 |0\u3009 = cos (\u03b3) |0\u3009 + sin (\u03b3) |1\u3009 .

(B6) Here jref , is a bit string that is not in the set {j1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 j\u03b7} associated to U \u2020QU |0\u3009 = \u2211j cj |j\u3009, i.e., Eq. (B1). This\n16\nis the bit string for which we assume \u03b8ref = 0; the idea is that since physically no component in the |jref \u3009 direction exists, cref = 0, the phase should be irrelevant, thus \u03b8ref = 0. By measuring the mjref = | \u30080a jref |\u03a8\u2032\u3009 |2, and using the amplitude |cj |, in the limit of \u03b3 \u2192 0+, the desired c\n(i) j is computed.\nReal Part.\u2013 The quantum circuit to compute c (r) j follows the same procedure but with an additional phase gate S, as shown in the quantum circuit of Fig. 9."
