Argument mining is to analyze argument structure and extract important argument information from unstructured text. An argument mining system can help people automatically gain causal and logical information behind the text. As argumentative corpus gradually increases, like more people begin to argue and debate on social media, argument mining from them is becoming increasingly critical. However, argument mining is still a big challenge in natural language tasks due to its difficulty, and relative techniques are not mature. For example, research on non-tree argument mining needs to be done more. Most works just focus on extracting tree structure argument information. Moreover, current methods cannot accurately describe and capture argument relations and do not predict their types. In this paper, we propose a novel neural model called AutoAM to solve these problems. We first introduce the argument component attention mechanism in our model. It can capture the relevant information between argument components, so our model can better perform argument mining. Our model is a universal end-to-end framework, which can analyze argument structure without constraints like tree structure and complete three subtasks of argument mining in one model. The experiment results show that our model outperforms the existing works on several metrics in two public datasets. 1 conclusion and future work In this paper, we propose a novel method for argument mining and first introduce the argument component attention mechanism. This is the first end-to-end argument mining model that can extract argument information without any structured constraints and get argument relations of good quality. In the model, ArguAtten can better capture the correlation information of argument components in an argumentative paragraph so as to better explore the argumentative relationship. Our experiment results show that our method achieves the state of the art.
