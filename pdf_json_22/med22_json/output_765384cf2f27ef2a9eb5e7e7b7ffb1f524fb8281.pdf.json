    "abstractText": "As countries around the world pay more and more attention to the sustainable development of the construction industry, the prefabricated building model has become the best construction type to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction. However, the prefabricated building entails higher technical requirements, and the workers involved in the construction must be trained to reduce the risks. For China, where the demographic dividend is gradually disappearing, how to quickly promote the industrializing workers process has become an urgent issue. is research focuses on the training and management of industrializing workers in prefabricated building. First, the facial images of the participants were collected from the actual test data, and the changes of participants\u2019 facial expressions were analyzed through multitask convolutional neural network-Lighten Facial Expression Recognition (MTCNN-LFER). e results of the analysis were plugged into the facial expression recognition and evaluation model for industrializing workers training in this research to calculate the weights, and then all the weights were clustered through the improved SWEM-SAMmethod. e results show the following: (1) the values of objective data were used to judge the participating workers\u2019 mastery of each knowledge and to evaluate whether they are quali\u0097ed. (2) e evaluation results were used to analyze the risk events that may be caused by participating workers.",

            "text": "With the development of global economy and engineering technology, the urbanization and industrialization of each country are also advancing [1], and the advancement of electronic intelligence technology has enabled the world industrial level to move into a New Era of Industry 4.0. In today\u2019s world of advocating resource conservation and sustainable development, the traditional construction model consumes a large amount of resources [2, 3] and produces a huge amount of construction waste that causes great damage to the environment. \u00a0erefore, the Chinese government has proposed the 14th Five-Year Plan and the long-range goals\nfor 2035 [4], in which prefabricated building model was promoted widely to drive sustainable development of the world environment. Since the prefabricated building model is not yet mature in China, there is a high technical requirement for workers. Besides, as China\u2019s population distribution changes, China is gradually entering an ageing society and the demographic dividend is rapidly declining. \u00a0e Chinese government has proposed to accelerate the process of industrialized workers to ensure su\u00a1cient numbers of professionals and high-quality technologies in the construction industry.\nAccording to data released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the PRC, this study\nHindawi Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience Volume 2022, Article ID 9230412, 18 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/9230412\ninvestigated safety accidents in the construction industry between 2009 and 2020 [5]. 96.17% of accidents with casualties were caused by workers\u2019 unsafe behaviours. 284 safety accidents in prefabricated buildings were reported in 2020 alone, with an average casualty rate of 1.63 people per accident [6]. Besides, 72.64% of the economic and legal problems leading to project delays stemmed from the failure of relevant practitioners to fulfil their obligations in accordance with contracts and laws and regulations.*erefore, a strict control of the training and management system for industrialized workers in prefabricated building is of greater significance in origin-tracing of accidents in such projects and can promote the stable and standardized development of the construction industry as a whole [7].\nAt present, the construction of prefabricated buildings worldwide is through the combination of prefabricated components and cast-in-place technology, the design concept of which is similar to the structural strength of cast-inplace buildings. *e main design method is to connect the prefabricated elements to the cast-in-place structure by solid longitudinal reinforcement connections and then technical processes are implemented to the joints of the whole building structure in order to achieve safety and durability that match the architectural design level [8]. As finished products, prefabricated components have high requirements on humidity, storage space, and maintenance methods in terms of production, transportation, and storage. Considering construction, the longitudinal reinforcement connection technology of prefabricated buildings is quite complex with a large number of joints and splicing gaps, and the waterproofing and insulation of walls are technically challenging [9]. *erefore, prefabricated buildings require workers with higher technical skills.\n*e traditional worker training system is only a twophase process from training to employment, and the workers are rural migrant workers with a mobile work nature. As these workers are poorly educated generally, they usually rely on \u201cexperience\u201d and tend to ignore the correct mechanical operation steps or the standardized and safe construction sequence, which has posed great engineering hidden dangers to the whole project. In recent years, with the advancement of industrialized workers, the relevant training system has incorporated the concept of assessment. But the practice of determining whether the training standards are met only based on the workers\u2019 test scores leads to neglect of workers\u2019 mastery of knowledge in different situations. It results in redundant training or muddling through the test, which will cause economic losses to the company and even failure to detect safety hazards in time.\nIn summary, based on the development background of China\u2019s construction industry, how to establish a training system with sound risk control for industrialized workers to ensure the quality of the advancement of the industrializing workers and to reduce the incidence of various risks in the construction industry is an urgent problem to be solved at present. *is research uses human behaviour modelling as the grassroots theory, adopts a combination of artificial intelligence and machine vision to recognize and analyze the facial expressions of workers undergoing industrializing\nworker training tests, and decomposes the test results of workers in different emotional contexts, so as to establish a facial expression recognition and evaluation model for industrializing worker training. *en the calculation results were clustered through the improved SWEM-SAM method to evaluate the effects of the worker training and to uncover the hidden risks and hazards in this worker group.\n*e rest of the research is organized as follows. In Section 2, literature research on basic theory involved in this paper is conducted to find theoretical support. Section 3 introduces the methods adopted in this research and improvement points. In Section 4, a facial expression recognition and evaluation model for industrializing worker training is established and four different scenarios are analyzed. In Section 5, the actual test data are plugged into the model for analysis. Section 6 discusses the analysis results, the correctness of the model, and the trends of the interpretation results and concludes the research to provide theoretical directions for further research."

            "text": "2.1. Human Behaviour Modelling. Human behaviour modelling is an interdisciplinary mathematical modelling method that evaluates what is happening and predicts what will happen through the external behaviour of humans. It has been successfully applied in a number of disciplines. Human behaviour is modelled based on rationality to find optimal solutions [10, 11], but, in practice, much human behaviour is found to deviate from rationality.\nSteyn investigated contingency reserves in engineering projects and modelled workers\u2019 behaviour at construction sites, so as to use the model to predict contingency reserves and prevent economic overruns of the project and possible shortening of construction period [12]. Meel et al. investigated personnel management in chemical plants and analyzed the management relationship between plant risk calculations and human behaviour patterns to study the correlation between unsafe human behaviour and training the workers received [13, 14]. Zhang et al. analyzed risk factors of man-made accidents in underground engineering by modelling human behaviour from three aspects of safety cognition, behaviour, and physiological states of humans and proposed how to control man-made risk causes [15]. Ronchi modelled dynamic evacuation behaviour of the crowd in fire scenarios by starting with big data analysis. He put forward a theory of management and prevention of disasters caused by crowd gathering by the fitting analysis of large bulk of data of movement patterns of each individual in the crowd and their state performance [16]. AsilianMahabadi et al. surveyed a large number of relevant practitioners by studying the prerequisites for unsafe behaviour of front-line workers and managers in civil engineering and discussed the ability of human behaviour models to accurately expose the risk causes of unsafe worker behaviour [17]. van der Kleij and Leukfeldt analyzed the status quo of unsafe behaviour in cyberspace and proposed a new network resilience framework that integrates resilience engineering and human behaviour models. A pilot study of more than 60\nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises in the Netherlands was conducted, the results of which could provide solid recommendations for organizations to better address cyberthreats [18]. Bai and Qian conducted a study on the validity and reliability of the human behaviour cognition factor and found that higher ratings of the people involved in such models had a greater contribution to quality assurance and safety behaviour in construction projects [19].\n*ere are many similar studies that can reflect the existence of a management relationship between human behaviour modelling and accident risk, which means trends of human behaviour can be used to predict the likelihood of risk occurrence. *is study aims to identify hidden risks in engineering by analyzing the distribution of workers\u2019 test scores.\n2.2. Emotional Expressions in Facial Expressions. Human facial expressions vary significantly under different emotions and the changes in facial expressions caused by each emotion are basically the same regardless of the country to which the person belongs. *erefore, studies related to emotion communication through facial expressions are mostly associated with human behaviour. Words can sometimes deceive, but a momentary change in facial expressions is difficult to hide.\nSuhr et al. started with the rising crime rate of automated bank teller machines. As the machine\u2019s sensing system could not accurately determine sabotage, the offenders\u2019 facial expressions captured by the camera were identified, especially during the sabotage period, to build a model of facial expressions of emotion, and finally a correlation between facial expressions and insecure behaviour was identified [20]. Pantano collected data on the facial expressions of a large group of consumers when they were engaged in consumer behaviour to build a machine learning model and employed facial expression recognition system to evaluate consumer behaviour and activities, allowing salespeople to guide consumers according to their emotional activities [21]. Israel and Schonbrodt measured the physiological phenomena generated by changes in facial expressions (including facial electromyography, heart rate changes, and brain electrical changes) to create a benchmark test emotion evaluation system based on machine learning algorithms and found that human emotional changes could affect human behaviour [22]. Liu et al. proposed a multilabel and distributed learning approach to analyze students\u2019 facial expressions in the classroom and assessed teaching quality by observing respondents\u2019 facial expressions. Corresponding improvement suggestions on teaching models were proposed to educational administrators [23]. Monaro et al. used machine learning methods to identify facial microexpressions with the study subject of criminals in interrogation and introduced the concept of speaker cognitive load to determine whether criminals lied to conceal the truth during questioning with the help of machine vision. Given the same control group experiment, judgment by facial expressions was correct 78% of the time, compared to the 57% of human judges [24]. In the healthcare industry,\nAltameem and Altameem developed a multimodal visualization analysis method by detecting facial expressions on patients to provide emergency treatment for patients through facial expression changes caused by adverse emotions [25]. De la Torre-Luque et al. found that emotion recognition is a key process of social cognition which reflects a person\u2019s maximal social adaptability. By comparing the facial expressions of a great number of normal people with those of psychopaths, a theoretical model for emotional decoding of human behaviour and facial expressions was developed [26]. Riquelme et al. collected a large amount of facial expression data of drivers and extracted feature codes to develop a driver fatigue monitoring system, which detects the driver\u2019s mouth aspect ratio, blinking frequency, and head tilt angle to determine whether the driver is in fatigue and alerts control staff in time, so as to avoid traffic accidents [27]. In a study on classroom teaching, Schneider et al. found that facial expressions are expressions of mental activity and that different facial expressions have a greater impact on learning efficiency. *e analysis of the emotional state of facial expressions provides effective suggestions for educational administrators to improve students\u2019 learning efficiency [28].\n*rough the above scholars\u2019 research, it is found that changes in facial expressions can convey the inner activities of human beings, which is a great aid to judging the mental state of the test subjects."

            "text": "workers\u201d refers to, in China where the demographic dividend is gradually disappearing, the process by which construction worker teams, mainly migrant workers, are reeducated, assessed, and qualified to engage in industrial production with long-term work effectiveness. With 200 million mobile migrant workers in China, migrant workers need to receive instruction and education in industrial production ideas, science and technology, the use of wearable devices, and efficient and safe workforce regulations to become industrializing workers.\nHe\u2019s study found that vocational education occupies a greater proportion of worker industrialization, suggesting a connection model that combines higher vocational education and industrializing worker training in conjunction with the talent cultivation models in construction vocational colleges [29]. Wang and Ji conducted a research on the demand for construction workers in different development stages of construction industrialization, analyzed the differences between construction workers in developed countries and in China in various aspects, and pointed out the significance of safety education for industrializing workers and implementation of labor security system on promoting industrializing workers [30]. In a study on the risk cognition of Spanish workers, Rodriguez-Garzon et al. found that the industrial transformation efficiency of workers was related to working population mobility. By aggregation and clustering analysis, it was found that the worker groups who received multiple trainings had stronger risk perception ability [31]. In the industrial transformation\nof workers in the construction of a laboratory at the Graz University of Technology, Karre et al. found that the key to transformation lied in supervision system and technical training should be strengthened [32]. Ke analyzed the complexity of the evolution frommigrant workers to industrializing workers in the construction industry in China on the basis of CAS theory and made recommendations based on an agentbased modelling [33]. Hatami and Kakavand deemed that behaviour modification plays an indispensable part in worker industrialization and proposed the PRECEDE-PROCEED approach to evaluate the educational intervention effectiveness of occupational safety training on industrializing workers. As a result, the programme greatly reduced unsafe behaviour [34]. Radhakrishnan et al. combined the industrializing worker training system with artificial intelligence by using IVR technology to simulate accidents in a virtual environment and transmit the perception data of the trainers [35]. Cao et al. adopted a CHAID decision tree and chi-square analysis from the aspect of construction safety to explore the primary and secondary influencing factors and unrelated factors in education and training for industrializing workers. A five-factor method for training effectiveness was proposed [36].\nMost of the previous studies have applied methods of traditional education industry to industrializing worker training, exploring the potential correlation between worker training effects and the reduction of accident probability. Combined with previous findings, this research focuses on the management relationship between training effect and risk factors occurrence in engineering.\nIn the previous studies, the calculation of risk and effect assessment was often based on the experts\u2019 criteria and ignored the influence of subjective wills. For example, it is difficult to know whether an expert is sensitive to a certain influencing factor and therefore the objective rules of development are ignored in the scoring. Moreover, the common mathematical model evaluation methods do not take into account the randomness and ambiguity of the evaluated objects, so the evaluation results sometimes differ greatly from the real situation. With the reduction of China\u2019s demographic dividend, the policy of industrializing workers has become an excellent strategy for China to address the coming huge labor shortage. *ere is still a large research gap on how to ensure the quality of training and education for industrializing workers. To fill this gap and make a combination to the prospect of highly intelligent industrial development in the context of Industry 4.0, this paper combines AI machine vision with an evaluation system as a theoretical basis. *e industrial worker training evaluation system is improved by considering the combined effect of workers\u2019 personal influence and experts\u2019 subjective will, so that the industrial worker training evaluation results can make timely and effective rectification of hidden engineering problems in the existing project management process of prefabricated buildings construction projects."

A large number of algorithms for image segmentation and artificial intelligence\nrecognition already exist, and each algorithm is designed for different areas. For the background of this research, the MTCNN face recognition algorithm is selected for individual objects, and, because of the need for real-time evaluation of facial expressions, the Lighten Facial Expression Recognition (LFER) is chosen and improved as human facial expression recognition algorithm, and the FER2013 dataset is used for expression classification and recognition training.\n3.1.1. MTCNN Human Face Recognition Method. *e high accuracy of the MTCNN face recognition algorithm comes from the organic combination of face detection and facial landmark detection. In the face classification and boundingbox regression stage, the main framework of MTCNN is similar to that of the Cascade algorithm and can be decomposed into a three-layer network structure. Before detection, the images are transformed to different sizes and image pyramids are constructed to accommodate face images of different pixels.\n*eMTCNN implementation process mainly adopts the method of candidate box plus classifier to realize fast and efficient face detection. *e three cascade networks are P-Net for fast candidate box, R-Net for candidate box filtering selection, and O-Net for generating face landmarks and face boundaries [37].\n*e training data for theMTCNN algorithmwas sourced from the Wider and CelebA databases.

            "text": "Human facial expression recognition relies on the classification of human face images collected by face recognition algorithms, equivalent to adding a classifier to the face recognition algorithm. LFER uses an annual deep convolutional network to fuse face expression feature extraction and classification into an end-to-end network. VGG-16/19 and ResNet-18/101/164 are employed in expression recognition and classification. Dropout is added before the full linked layer to increase the robustness of the algorithm model and prevent overfitting. An increase in robustness will improve the stability of the model and increase its recognition ability. Overfitting will lead to a lack of dispersion, thus increasing the probability of misjudgment. *e seven categories of expressions were feeling disgusted, angry, sad, worried, neutral, happy, and surprised. *e full linked layer in VGG and ResNet is removed, and the concept of loss function and cross-entropy is introduced. *e calculation process of cross-entropy is shown in the following equation [39]:\nJ(\u03b8) \ufffd \u2212 1 m \nm\ni\ufffd1 y\nilog h\u03b8 x i    + 1 \u2212 yi log 1 \u2212 h\u03b8 x i    .\n(4)\n*e LFER algorithm uses Network Slimming and binarization methods for model compression to speed up recognition and employs Batch Normalization (BN) to reduce computation amount. *e images of low BN indicator will be removed. *e BN calculation formula is shown as follows:\nz \ufffd zin \u2212 \u03bc\u03b2( \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\u03c32\u03b2 + \u03b5  ; zout \ufffd cz + \u03b2 . (5)\n3.2. Structural Entropy Weight Method. In information theory, entropy represents the measure of uncertainty of a dataset. *e absolute value of entropy becomes larger as the uncertainty of the information expressed in the dataset increases, and the value of entropy contains more information. Correspondingly, the smaller the value of entropy is, the poorer the information it contains and the more homogeneous the meaning of the representative indicator is.\nSince SEWM has the function of both quantitative and qualitative analysis, it can be called an objective empowerment method in which the variation of values depends on the dispersion of the calculated dataset. *e basic process of SEWM calculation is as follows: firstly, making a combination with Delphi method and fuzzy analysis method. *e fuzzy analysis method is used to fuzzify the experts\u2019 scores and quantify the ranking according to the subjective will of the experts. After the quantification is completed, the normalization process is performed. *en, cognitive blindness degree analysis and entropy calculation are performed for the quantitative order of experts\u2019 judgments, and the possible bias due to the subjective opinions of experts is corrected. Finally, the weighting value is calculated [40]. *e detailed calculation and formula are shown below.\n3.2.1. Arranging the Quantization Order of the Datasets. According to the Delphi method, k experts in the relevant fields are selected to fill out the questionnaire. *e basis of data acquisition in this paper is built on machine vision, so the sample data of answers from k relevant workers can be used as the data source. *e questionnaire taken by the original Delphi method is replaced by a random fixed number of classified questions from the question bank.\n*e importance of the sample data is obtained by the positive and negative selection method considering facial expressions in this paper, where 1 is an important indicator and n unimportant. For the i samples and j indicators in the dataset, where 1\u2264 i\u2264 k and 1\u2264 j\u2264 n, the representation performed by the aij array is shown as follows:\naij \ufffd\na11 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a1n\n\u22ee \u22f1 \u22ee\nak1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 akn\n\u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6. (6)\n3.2.2. Making Normalization of Indicators: Homogenization of Heterogeneous Indicators. Each indicator may have inconsistent measurement units in statistical decision-making, so it is necessary to standardize the sorted datasets and convert the relative values of indicators into absolute values to solve inconsistent measurement methods for different indicators. Since the normalization of the data group value is an absolute value, the greater the difference in the Hamming distance of each normalized data, the greater the dispersion.\n*e normalization processing method is related to the calculation method, as shown in (7) and (8):\nPositive indicators:\na \u2019 ij \ufffd\naij \u2212 min a1j, a2j, . . . , anj \nmax a1j, a2j, . . . , anj  \u2212 min a1j, a2j, . . . , anj  .

(8)\nTo simplify the formula, the normalized data a\u2019ij is still denoted by aij.\n3.2.3. Weight Calculation for Qualitative Analysis and Quantitative Analysis. Relying on the concept of entropy weight method, the quantitative analysis data is revised, where I is the order in the data group andm is the conversion parameter whose values are usually equal to j + 2 (m \ufffd j + 2) [40]. *e quantitative analysis correction is shown as follows:\n\u03bc(I) \ufffd \u2212 ln(m \u2212 I) ln(m \u2212 1) . (9)\nSubstituting aij into the above formula, the quantitative analysis correction array bij is obtained. *e expert cognitive blindness degree analysis parameter Qj is introduced. *e calculation formula of Qj is shown as follows:\nQj \ufffd max b1j, b2j, . . . , bnj  \u2212 bj  + min b1j, b2j, . . . , bnj  \u2212 bj  \n2 \n .\n(10)\n*e perception of the relevant respondents for the indicator is defined as xj and the standardized weights are calculated. *e calculation process is shown in the two following equations:\nxj \ufffd bj 1 \u2212 Qj .

For the possibility of fuzzy numbers and uniform or normal distribution, the linguistic terms and sentiment labels of the relevant descriptions are expressible as affiliation functions of different values. In previous risk assessments, triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers were mostly used. For qualitative and comparative analysis, converting collected data into fuzzy numbers is more adaptable than converting them into probability distributions [41]. In this study, it is necessary to use the improved SAM to convert the data into fuzzy numbers for aggregation and then to evaluate the effect through weight calculation.\n*is study proposes an improved SAM that introduces the concept of emotional expression when inputting data and changes the previous expert evaluation system to the facial expression recognition dataset of the surveyed person. *e method quantifies the change in respondents\u2019 emotions during the test through human behaviourmodelling, and the resulting fuzzy numbers are corrected based on multiple factors. In previous studies, some scholars selected experts\u2019 position, duration of practice, age, and education as rank divisions [42].\n*e improved SAM calculation processes are as follows:\n(1) Suppose that there are Ei experts, where 1\u2264 i\u2264 k. Calculate the consistency S(Ru, Rv) of quantitative data for each expert (respondent), where Ru and Rv are the fuzzy numbers of S. *e formula of quantitative data consistency is shown as follows:\nS Ru, Rv  \ufffd 1 \u2212 1\n55i\ufffd1 ai \u2212 bi   , (13)"

Data Investigation and Collection. *e data for this study, done with the assistance of Python 3.8 programming language, were obtained from the results of the responses to the questions drawn from the question bank, which were all multiple-choice questions about knowledge related to safety in assembled buildings, divided into five sections: Knowledge about Engineering Project Management (KPM), Cautions at Construction Site (CCS), Prefabricated Component Hoisting and Installation (PHI) Knowledge, Emergency Accident Handling Methods (EAM), and Laws and Regulations Related to Construction (LRC). As respondents took the training test, cameras were used to capture their facial expressions, recorded at 30 frames per second, with a 10-second response time for each question and a final 2- second answer checking phase. *e footage is then split at 15-frame intervals. Twenty face images are collected for each question, and each respondent can provide 2000 face images for analysis. *e pseudocode of collecting facial expression data for the industrializing worker training test is shown in Algorithm 1.\nSubsequently, every 20 images were formed into a data group for expression analysis using the MTCNN-LFER model.

Evaluation Model of Facial Expression Recognition for IndustrializingWorkerTraining. Quantitative analysis of the collected data is required before the construction of the expression recognition evaluation model. *e difference between the data collection phase of this study and the establishment of previous evaluation models is that previous evaluation models mostly use the mechanism of expert scoring, while that in this study is derived from the respondents\u2019 status while taking the answer test. *is study uses the Likert\u2019s seven-level scale method to assign different categories of facial expression recognition (including disgusted, angry, sad, worried, neutral, happy, and surprised) from 1 to 7 points. *e formula for preliminary scoring is shown in Equation (15). t is the moment, pemo is the bias probability for each expression, and Sl7 is the assigned score on the 7-point Likert scale. Sr is the parameter for correct or incorrect answers, and when the answer is correct, Sr is 1.2; otherwise, Sr is 0.8. *e division of expression scores based on Likert\u2019s seven-level scale is shown in Figure 4 [43].\nWemo \ufffd \n20\nt\ufffd1 \n7\npemo\ufffd1\npemo \u00d7 Sl7\nn  Sr. (15)\nHowever, the assignment of expressions is not the final \u201cexpert score,\u201d because the data comes from training tests, and the answers will be right or wrong. However, in the process of testing, workers may be unskilled in the operation of electronic equipment or emotionally resulting in deviations in the visual area. Furthermore, there is a possibility that when a worker encounters an uncertain option, he guesses the correct option by luck. Monaro et al. [24] defined the concept of error and hesitation degree in the research of facial expression detection deception. *rough the survey, it was found that, due to differences in education, gender, age, and other influencing factors, different people will have abnormal facial expressions when they make judgment. According to the average conditions of Chinese workers, the range of the error degree \u03c4 is 0.6514 \u00b1 0.1343, and that of hesitation degree \u03c5 is 0.4875 \u00b1 0.098 [24].\nIn view of the above situation, this article expresses the worker\u2019s facial expression changes and corresponding moments of each question with images and selects 4 curved surfaces and curves under abnormal mood fluctuations as special images for analysis. *e four abnormal images are shown in Figure 5. According to the fluctuation trend of the four curves, it can be analyzed as the four following situations.\nSituation 1. When the respondents first saw the topic, the expression was worried, indicating that the worker did not understand the randomly selected topic and felt worried. But, in the subsequent reading stage, workers who are skilled in training knowledge tend to be natural in their expressions. After finishing reading the questions, if the workers have a good memory of the correct answers, their facial expressions will turn into a happy state and will turn into a natural look during the answer verification stage.\nSituation 2. Before the answer verification, it is the same as situation 1.When checking the answers, if the worker is fully sure of the knowledge points involved in the question, but when making choices, it may be due to operational errors or incorrect memory, which may cause the worker to have a short period of frustration during the test. In order to eliminate the worker\u2019s wrong operation and memory error, the error degree \u03c4 (\u03c4 \ufffd 0.7) is introduced for the first time to correct the evaluation score of the worker\u2019s answers.\nSituation 3. When workers are not very familiar with randomly selected questions, they will maintain a worried look at the initial reading stage; then when thinking about the questions further, they will show sadness and regret expressions due to the vague memory. In the answer verification stage, as the\nwrong answer is expected, the worker\u2019s expression will return to a sad look, worrying about the next question.\nSituation 4. Before the answer verification stage, it is similar to situation 3. When checking the answers, they will feel surprised because of the unexpected correct answers. However, the workers\u2019 choices under this emotion are only done through luck and guessing, so this study introduces hesitation degree \u03c5 (\u03c5 \ufffd 0.45) to modify the evaluation score of the workers\u2019 answers [44].\nBased on the four situations of emotional changes in industrializing workers training test under normal conditions, this paper establishes an emotional analysis and evaluation process for industrializing workers training test. *e process is shown in Figure 6.\nAccording to process analysis, (15) is improved with the introduction of the concepts of error and hesitancy degree.\n*e improved expression score division weight calculation method is shown as follows:\nWemo \ufffd  4\nt\ufffd1 \n7\npemo\ufffd1\npemo \u00d7 Sl7\nn   + \n16\nt\ufffd5 \n7\npemo\ufffd1\npemo \u00d7 Sl7\nn \u03c4  + \n20\nt\ufffd17 \n7\npemo\ufffd1\npemo \u00d7 Sl7\nn \u03c5 \u239b\u239d \u239e\u23a0Sr. (16)\nAll data collected in this study were entered into the evaluation process, and the results were calculated with SEWM-SAM to derive the final weight ranking. *e highest weight value is themost significant point of themodel source data."

            "text": "6.1. Discussion. In the process of building the model, MTCNN-LFER was used to analyze the respondents\u2019 facial expressions in real time in order to conform to objective facts, and four situations were analyzed according to the characteristics of expression changes under different mental activities. In previous evaluation system, respondents\u2019 feedback was only scored based on their performance results. For example, in Scenario 2, the respondents\u2019 misselection would be directly judged as a wrong situation according to the conventional evaluation system. However, their initial judgments are valid. Inaccurate evaluation results will lead to wrong final rating, thus affecting workers\u2019 training enthusiasm. For construction units, wrong evaluation leads to redundant training course arrangement, which affects the efficiency of workers\u2019 industrialization process and also wastes a lot of financial and material resources [33].\nHowever, there is another situation, such as Situation 4, where the worker guesses the correct option. For this case, the traditional evaluation method does not consider whether the worker has a solid knowledge of the question but only recognizes that the worker\u2019s choices are correct and thus determines that the worker has a high level of mastery of such knowledge. According to the description of human behaviour, humans always make constant rather than consistent and repetitive guesses about the unknown. *e worker will choose another answer when the correctly guessed question is retested in a short time. For workers, with the help of good luck to save time and effort, they do not need to master engineering-related knowledge. However, for construction units, workers who muddle through with this trick may cause greater property damage or even affect engineering safety and cause malignant casualty accidents. *erefore, it is necessary to introduce relevant parameters to modify the model to ensure that the model is suitable for the development rule of objective facts, so that the applicability of the evaluation system is stronger, which will have guiding significance for similar industries.\nAccording to the final weight calculation and cluster analysis results, it was found that, in some knowledge sections, although a small number of them scored high and the final composite score was higher compared with other sections, there was a large dispersion, which proved that workers did not have a firm grasp of such knowledge and still many knowledge points needed to be checked and remedied. *erefore, even though the overall score is the highest, there is still a need for training and education. In engineering construction, muddling through is never an option, as workers with poor knowledge may have a great impact on the entire project. In Li et al.\u2019s study, it was noted that unsafe behaviour in engineering is related not only to the workers\u2019 own behaviour but also to cognitive biases in different contexts. Poor worker handling can also contribute to engineering accidents; however, the correctness of the\nhandling is related to the way the worker chooses to deal with the problem [45].\n*e weight solution of this study for each question can also give feedback on the proficiency of the question in the section to which it belongs; in particular, the test after training can reflect whether workers have evasive behaviour for a certain knowledge point. Chen has suggested in previous research that workers will often adopt unsafe behaviours to ensure that progress is efficient [46]. *is type of problem can be explained by the pattern presented by the group industrial worker training test to explain the current engineering safety climate problem that exists in the group of industrial workers.\nFor example, a worker has insufficient knowledge about construction phase reports when answering questions, and most of the workers in the construction team have this situation; then it can be inferred that the construction is in poor quality.*e root of this can be found to be a hidden line of conflict of interest between the worker, the construction unit, and the regulator [47]. *e quality of training of the group can thus be screened to identify more hidden dangers that affect the economy and safety of engineering under the policy of industrializing worker training process.\nAccording to the model validation, it can be seen from the calculation and analysis of the evaluation results of the trainingmanagement of industrializing workers in this study that hidden dangers and accidents in engineering projects are closely related to the skills mastered by workers. In all construction stages of engineering projects, the management of industrializing worker training can be improved to eliminate possible hazards and stop accidents in time to ensure safe, economical, and stable construction and production of the engineering project.\n6.2. Conclusion. *is paper is based on the background that the Chinese government proposes to accelerate the process of industrializing workers in response to the rapid reduction of the domestic demographic dividend and the rapid weakening of the labor advantage in the era of Industry 4.0. *e artificial intelligence machine vision and fuzzy mathematical evaluation system are combined to test the workers who receive industrializing training and record the information related to the change of facial expressions and the correct rate of assessment when the workers receive the test assessment. In addition, the evaluation model of facial expression recognition for industrializing worker training is used to conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis and finally arrive at the aggregated information results.*emain conclusions of this study are as follows:\n(1) *e expert scoring mechanism in the evaluation model is improved by using machine vision to analyze the changes in workers\u2019 facial expressions during the test to determine their mental activities, effectively preventing the waste of money and time for subsequent training due to wrong operations. It also prevents workers from guessing the answers and ignoring the forgotten knowledge points, which reduces the possibility of more safety accidents and property damage to the project.\n(2) *e questions of each section are converted into primary and secondary indicators to conduct an aggregation consistency analysis, and the weight of each indicator and the significance of the aggregation analysis are used to indicate the degree of mastery of the tested workers on the knowledge of each section. According to the discrete degree of each question, we can check whether it is a common problem of the construction workers and can timely find out the safety, economic, or management hazards.\nIn this paper, although the necessity of objective facts is considered to the greatest extent when analyzing and mathematically modelling the changes in facial expressions of workers doing the test, there still exist the following deficiencies:\n(1) *ere is no evaluation or research analysis of workers\u2019 psychological states. Actually, the differences in personalities and psychological states may affect the accuracy of emotions conveyed through facial expressions during the test.\n(2) In analyzing the dispersion of each knowledge point, only the problems of the workers were considered, but, in fact, it is possible that some irregularities caused by \u201ctraditional experience\u201d of the industry lead to workers not recognizing the standardized operation, or some people with management authority forbid workers to follow the standardized practice of construction or project handling.\n*ese deficiencies can be refined in future research and solved by multiobjective optimization methods."
