    "abstractText": "In this paper, the fundamental statistics of fluctuating Beckmann shadowed (FBS) fading model which is composite of fluctuating Beckmann (FB) and inverse Nakagami-m distributions, are provided. Accordingly, a wide range of composite generalized fading distributions can be obtained as special cases of the proposed distribution, such as, double shadowed \u03ba \u2212 \u03bc fading Type I. To this effect, mathematically tractable expressions of both the exact and asymptotic at high signal-to-noise (SNR) regime of the probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and generalised-moment generating function (G-MGF) are derived. In addition, the fundamental statistics for integer m and even value of \u03bc that represent the shadowing of the dominant components and real extension of the number of the multipath clusters, respectively, are given in simple closed-from formats. These statistical characterizations are then used to evaluate the performance of the wireless communications in terms of the outage probability (OP), average bit error probability (ABEP), amount-of-fading (AF), channel quality estimation index (CQEI), error vector magnitude (EVM), average channel capacity (ACC), and effective throughput (ET). Furthermore, the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curve of the energy detection based spectrum sensing and the secure outage probability (SOP) as well as the lower bound of SOP (SOP) of the physical layer are also analysed. The validation of the derived expressions is verified via comparing the numerical results with the Monte-Carlo simulations for different values of the fading parameters.",

INTRODUCTION\nTHE shadowing has been widely considered as a large-scale fading that may affect on the wireless communications channel at the same time with the small-scale fading, namely, multipath [1]. Hence, many efforts have been dedicated in the state-of-the-art to provide the composite fading distributions. For instance, the authors in [1] derived the probability density function (PDF) of the composite Rayleigh/lognormal fading distribution. Due to the high computational intricacy of the fundamental statistics as well as the performance metrics that is yielded by the log-normal model, the gamma distribution was then used to represent the shadowing impact. Hence, the K distribution was introduced in [2] as composite of Rayleigh/gamma distributions and used in [3] to analyse the outage probability (OP) and average bit error rate (ABER) of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) and minimum shift keying digital modulation schemes. The performance of digital communications systems in terms of the ABER and average channel capacity (ACC) over composite\nManuscript received December 00, 2022. The authors are with the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Brunel University London, London, UK, e-mail: Hussien.AlHmood@brunel.ac.uk, Hamed.Al-Raweshidy@brunel.ac.uk.\nof Nakagami-m/gamma model, namely, KG distribution was studied in [4]. The PDF, cumulative distribution function (CDF), and moment generating function (MGF) of Rician shadowed fading conditions were provided in [5] and [6].\nRecently, different composite generalised/gamma distributions have been presented in the technical literature to obtain results with better fitting to the empirical measurements than the classical models. In addition, most of the well-known composite fading distributions can be derived from these generalised models via inserting special values for the fading parameters. Accordingly, in [7] and [8], the authors proposed the \u03ba\u2212\u00b5/gamma fading model as a composite of \u03ba\u2212\u00b5 fading [9] which is used to model the line-of-sight (LoS) communications scenario and gamma distribution that represents the shadowing impact. The authors in [10] derived the statistics of the \u03ba-\u00b5 shadowed fading that represents a unified approach of both the \u03ba\u2212\u00b5 and \u03b7\u2212\u00b5 distributions [11] where the dominant of both the in-phase and quadrature components are shadowed by a Nakagami-m distribution. Hence, the performance of energy detection (ED) based spectrum sensing, error vector magnitude (EVM) and physical layer security over \u03ba-\u00b5 shadowed fading channels were studied in [12], [13], and [14], respectively. The \u03ba-\u00b5 shadowed fading of [10] was then extended by [15] to obtain the fluctuating Beckmann (FB) fading model that unifies the \u03ba-\u00b5 [9] and Beckmann [16], [17] distributions in a single representation (see [15, Table I]). Consequently, the secrecy of the physical layer and effective rate of FB fading were analysed in [18] and [19], respectively. On the other side, the influence of the shadowing on the non-LoS (NLoS) communications condition was represented by the composite of \u03b7 \u2212 \u00b5/gamma fading model [8], [20], [21].\nMore recently, the inverse gamma (IG) distribution has been given a special attention by several works to model the influence of the shadowing. This is because the inverse distribution provides highly accurate results with simple mathematically tractable statistical properties in comparison with the gamma model [22]. For example, the authors in [23] derived the PDF, CDF, and MGF of both the signal envelope and instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over Fisher-Snedecor F fading in which the multipath is modelled by a Nakagami-m distribution whereas the shadowing is represented by an inverse Nakagamim distribution. Based on these statistics, the capacity of the channel with different transmission policies, such as, ACC and effective throughput (ET), and physical layer security in terms of the secure outage probability (SOP) and its lower bound (SOPL) over Fisher-Snedecor F fading channels, were analysed in [24] and [25], respectively. Furthermore, the behaviour of an energy detector over Fisher-Snedecor F fading channels was analysed in [26]. The PDF and CDF of both \u03ba-\u00b5/IG and \u03b7\u2212\u00b5/IG composite fading distributions were given in [27] with practical validations for different communications scenarios.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

See: https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/rights-policies.html\nThe applications of these statistical characterisations for the performance analysis of wireless communications systems in terms of the average symbol error rate (ASER), ACC, and ET were investigated in [28], [29]-[30], and [31], respectively.\nBased on the empirical advantages of IG distribution in modelling of the large-scale fading, in this paper, the fluctuating Beckmann shadowed (FBS) fading model is suggested as a generalised composite distribution. Moreover, this model reduces to the double shadowed of Rician [32] and \u03ba-\u00b5 Type I [33]-[34] fading scenarios after a proper selection for the values of the fading parameters.\nThe novel contributions of this paper are listed as follows: \u2022 Deriving the PDF, CDF, generalised-MGF (G-MGF) of\nFBS fading model for both the signal envelope and instantaneous SNR. To this end, novel exact mathematically tractable expressions are obtained in terms of the Lauricella hypergeometric function as well as the Meijer\u2019s G-function (MGF) of four variables. \u2022 Providing novel simple exact closed-form expressions of the aforementioned statistics via assuming the shadowing severity index m and \u00b5 are integer and even values, respectively. \u2022 The asymptotic expressions of the PDF, CDF, and GMGF at high average SNR regime are also given. These expressions are then used to earn further insights into the impact of the channel parameters on the behaviour of the communications systems . \u2022 Leveraging our new statistical properties, we analyse the OP, ABEP, amount-of-fading (AoF), channel quality estimation index (CQEI), EVM, ACC, and ET of the wireless communications systems. Moreover, the AUC curve of the energy detection based spectrum sensing and the lower bound SOP are studied. \u2022 Capitalising on the above, the asymptotic expressions for all the exact performance metrics at high average SNR values are derived. Accordingly, more insights are obtained when the transmitted signal is subject to double shadowing impacts simultaneously.\nOrganization: Section II provides some principles about the FB fading distribution. The exact and asymptotic statistical characterizations of FBS fading condition are derived in Section III which is divided into two subsections. These statistics are given for arbitrary values of \u00b5 and m in the Subsection III.A. However, in the Subsection III.B, the PDF, CDF, and G-MGF are presented for even \u00b5 and integer m. Section IV demonstrates the special fading models that can be extracted from the FBS fading. The exact and asymptotic expressions of the OP, ABEP, AF, CQEI, EVM, ACC, ET, average AUC of ED, and lower bound of SOP are derived in Section V as applications of FBS fading channel in the performance evaluation of wireless communications systems. In Section VI, the numerical results and Monte Carlo simulations are presented for different shadowing scenarios. Finally, some conclusion remarks about the statistical properties of the proposed model and their applications are highlighted in Section VII.\nNotations: j = \u221a \u22121, ln(.) is the natural logarithm, E[.] indicates the expectation process of the random variable (RV), Var[.] denotes the variance of the RV, \u0393(.) is the Gamma\nfunction [35, eq.

            "heading": "IV. SPECIAL CASES OF FBS FADING MODEL",
            "text": "The derived statistics of the FBS fading model represent the unified expressions for number of well-known fading distributions. For instance, the statistical properties of the FBS fading model become identical with that of the double shadowed \u03ba-\u00b5 Type I (example 1) fading [33] and FB [15] fading distributions via inserting \u03b7 = 1 and ms \u2192 \u221e, respectively. Additionally, the FBS reduces to \u03ba-\u00b5 shadowed fading [10] via setting \u03b7 = 1 and ms \u2192 \u221e. The Beckmann distribution [16] is obtained from the FBS fading model by letting \u03ba = K, \u00b5 = 1, m\u2192\u221e, \u03b7 = q, % = r, and ms \u2192\u221e. Similarly, the first order statistics of the \u03b7-\u00b5/inverse gamma [27] fading can be deduced from the expressions of Section III via employing r\u03022 = msms\u22121 r\u0302\n2, \u03ba = 0, \u00b5 = \u00b5, \u03b7 = \u03b7, and ms = ms. All the fading models that can be extracted from the FBS distribution via selecting certain values for the fading parameters are shown in Table I. As explained in this table, the FBS fading distribution is extremely versatile as it inherit all of the generality of the double shadowed \u03ba-\u00b5 Type I (example 1) [33] and FB [15] fading distributions.\nFig. 1 shows the PDF of the signal envelope R of FBS fading distribution for \u03ba = 2.9 (moderate LoS scenario), \u00b5 = 4, m = 2.3 (mild fluctuation of the LoS component), \u03b7 = 0.1 (the NLoS components is imbalanced by 10), %2 = 0.1 (moderately large power imbalance of the LoS components), ms = 3.8 (moderate shadowing), and r\u0302 = 0.8. In this figure, the numerical results and Monte-Carlo simulations are represented by the solid lines and markers, respectively. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the increasing in \u03b7 of the FBS fading from 0.1 to 1 (double shadowed \u03ba-\u00b5 Type I (example 1) [33])\nwould lead to move the amplitude of the PDF towards its mean value. The reason of this observation that is consistent with the results of [15], refers to the impact of the imbalance of the NLoS components in the case of \u03b7 6= 1 which is more noticeable than \u03b7 6= 0.1. Besides, the amplitude of the PDF of the double shadowed \u03ba-\u00b5 Type I slightly increases as well as shifts it to the rightwards and becomes more closer to the mean value when ms approaches to infinity, namely, \u03ba-\u00b5 shadowed fading [10]. It is worth remarking that Fig. 1 also includes the PDF of the signal envelope R of double shadowed Rician Type I [32], \u03ba-\u00b5 [9], \u03b7-\u00b5/inverse gamma [27], and Nakagamim [41] fading distributions which are deduced from the FBS fading model via setting the parameters for specific values as demonstrated in Table I."

            "heading": "VI. NUMERICAL AND SIMULATION RESULTS",
            "text": "In this section, the influence of the shadowing parameter ms on the derived performance metrics over FBS fading channel is studied via comparing the numerical results with the Monte Carlo simulations which are obtained by 106 realizations. In all figures, the theoretical, simulation and asymptotic results are represented by the markers, solid and dashed lines, respectively. Three different scenarios which are heavy, moderate, and light shadowing with ms = 1.5, ms = 5.5, and ms = 50, respectively, are analysed. Additionally, in all figures, excluding the special cases, \u03ba = 2, \u00b5 = 1.5, m = 2.5, \u03b7 = 0.1, and %2 = 0.2. Furthermore, all the figures include the result of some special cases of the FBS fading, such as, FB, Rayleigh, \u03ba-\u00b5, and double Rician shadowed, that are given in Table I.1\nFigs. 2 and 3 illustrate the OP for \u03b3th = 0 dB and \u03b3th = 10 dB and ABEP for BPSK and BFSK modulation schemes, respectively, versus the average SNR, \u03b3\u0304. As expected, both the OP and ABEP diminish when ms increases. This improvement in the system performance refers to the reduction in the impact of the shadowing on the total received signal power. For example, at \u03b3th = 10 dB and SNR = 20 dB (fixed), the OP for ms = 1.5 is approximately 0.1545 whereas the values of the OP for ms = 5.5 and ms = 50 are nearly 0.0433 and 0.0318, respectively. Similarly, when SNR is constant at 20 dB, the ABEP of BPSK with ms = 50 is roughly 27.75% less than that of ms = 5.5. Besides, for all cases of ms of Fig. 2, the OP of \u03b3th = 0 dB is lower than that of \u03b3th = 10 dB which is consistent with the results of [41]. This is because the range of the average SNR of \u03b3th = 0 dB is smaller than that of \u03b3th = 10 dB which would lead to decrease the probability that depends on the comparison \u03b3\u0304 \u2264 \u03b3th. Additionally, Figs. 2 and 3 also plot the OP and ABEP for Rayleigh fading channel. From both figures and after a certain value of average SNR, it can be noticed that the values of the OP and ABEP of Rayleigh fading are higher than that of the FBS fading model\n1It is worth mentioning that the impact of the other fading parameters, namely, \u03ba, \u00b5, \u03b7, m, and %, on the performance of FB fading condition has been extensively explained in the technical literature (please refer to [15], [18], and [19]). Therefore, in this work, we have focused on the index ms.\nwith ms = 1.5. This change in the behaviour is due to the effect of the parameter \u00b5 that increases with the high value of \u03b3\u0304 . This fact proves the correctness of our derived expressions of the diversity order of the OP and ABEP which depend on \u00b5 that is 1 for Rayleigh and 1.5 for other cases.\nFig. 4 depicts the EVM versus instantaneous SNR, \u03b3, for r\u0302 = 1 and r\u0302 = 0.5. As anticipated, the EVM reduces when r\u0302 and/or ms increase. The reason for the influence of r\u0302 refers to the increasing in the mean value of the received signal power whereas the explanation for the impact of ms on the EVM is the same as that of the OP and ABEP. For instance, at \u03b3 = \u22126 dB and ms = 5.5, the EVM is decreased by approximately\n29.25% when r\u0302 changes from 0.5 to 1. The CQEI versus \u03b3\u0304 is shown in Fig. 5 for ms = 2.1, ms = 6.1, and ms = 50. It is clear that as ms decreases, the CQEI increases. This is because the diminishing in ms would lead to increase the AF. From Fig. 5 and at \u03b3\u0304 = 15 dB (fixed), when ms reduces from 6.1 to 2.1, the CQEI is increased by nearly 44.83%. For further validation of the derived expressions, the curves of the CQEI of \u03ba-\u00b5 and Nakagami-1.5 fading conditions are also presented in Fig. 5. It can be noticed that \u03ba-\u00b5 has better performance than Nakagami-1.5. This superiority is the result of the influence of the parameter \u03ba which is 2 for \u03ba-\u00b5 fading and \u03ba \u2192 0 for Nakagami-1.5 fading.\nFig. 6 portrays the ACC versus \u03b3\u0304 for \u00b5 = 2 and m = 3. Like the OP, ABEP, EVM, and CQEI, the ACC improves with the increasing in ms and/or m and for the same reasons that have been explained before. For example, when ms = 1.5 and \u03b3\u0304 = 20 dB are fixed, the values of the ACC of m = 3 and m = 1 are approximately 5.195 and 4.732, respectively.\nThe ACC of \u03ba-\u00b5 fading model is also given in Fig. 6 for the validation as well as comparison purposes.\nIn Fig. 7, the ET versus \u03b3\u0304 is plotted for A = 3.5 and A = 4.5. Similar to the previous performance measures, the ET enhances when the shadowing changes form heavy to moderate and light. As one can observe, that moving from ms = 1.5 to ms = 5.5 and ms = 50, 4.5 dB and 6 dB are respectively needed to obtain ET = 4 bits/s/Hz. Moreover, it is interesting to notice that the moving from A = 4.5 to A = 3.5, 4.36 dB and 4.37 dB are roughly required to achieve ET = 5 bits/s/Hz for ms = 5.5 and ms = 50, respectively. The decreasing in A is yielded due to the diminishing in the delay exponent of the received signal. These observations are matched with the results reported in [46] and [47]. Additionally, Fig. 5 plots the ET for the double Rician shadowed Type I fading model which is extracted from the FBS fading model via inserting K = \u03ba (K stands for the Rician factor), \u00b5 = 1, \u03b7 = 1, m = 2.5, and ms = 1.5. This curve shows the degradation in the performance of an ET due\nto the diminishing in \u00b5 from \u00b5 = 1.5 to \u00b5 which confirms the correctness of our derived expression.\nFig. 8 portrays the complementary AUC (CAUC) which equals to 1 \u2212 A\u0304 versus \u03b3\u0304 for different ms and u. From this figure, it is obvious that the CAUC reduces, i.e., A\u0304 becomes better, when ms increases and/or u decreases. The reason for the impact of ms has been comprehensively explained in the analysis of the results of Figs. 2-7 whereas the influence of u refers to the faster increasing in the average detection probability in comparison with the false alarm probability. At constant u = 5 and \u03b3\u0304 = 25 dB, the CAUC of ms = 1.5 is approximately 79.79% lower than that of ms = 5.5. At the same value of \u03b3\u0304 and ms = 50, the variation in u from 5 to 2 decreases the CAUC by nearly 58.21%. It is worth interesting that the CAUC of FB fading condition is also presented in Fig. 8 via using ms = 50, i.e., ms \u2192\u221e.\nThe SOPL versus \u03b3\u0304 is depicted in Fig. 9 for different scenarios of the shadowing and values of \u03b3\u0304E . The parameters of both main and wiretap channels are supposed to be arbitrarily\ndistributed variates via using (\u03bal, \u00b5l, ml, \u03b7l, %2l ) = (2, 2, 1, 0.1, 0.2) with l \u2208 {D,E}, msE = 5.5, and msD = 1.5, 5.5, 50. From this figure, a clear improvement in the secrecy behaviour is noticed when msD , \u03b3\u0304D and/or \u03b3\u0304E become high, large, and/or low, respectively. Intuitively, the high increasing in \u03b3\u0304D refers to good quality of the main communication channel whereas the high decreasing in \u03b3\u0304E means a large degradation in the quality of the Alice-Eavesdropper link, namely, wiretap channel. To obtain 10\u22122 of SOPL at constant \u03b3\u0304E = 5 dB, it requires nearly 36 dB, 32 dB, and 31 dB, respectively, for ms = 1.5, ms = 5.5, and ms = 50. In addition, when ms = 1.5 and \u03b3\u0304D = 25 dB are fixed, the SOPL of \u03b3\u0304E = 5 and \u03b3\u0304E = \u22125 are 8.712\u00d710\u22122 and 1.199\u00d710\u22122, respectively. For comparison purpose, the SOPL over FB fading model that has been studied in [18] is also provided in Fig. 9.\nIn all figures, it can be seen that an excellent agreement between the numerical results and their Monte Carlo simulation counterparts which affirms the validation of our derived expressions. Besides, all the asymptotic at high average SNR and exact results are perfectly matched which represents another verification for the correctness of our analysis."

            "text": "This paper was devoted to provide the statistical properties of a new composite fading model, namely, FBS fading which is a composite of fluctuating Beckmann/inverse Nakagami-m distributions. To be specific, the PDF, CDF, and G-MGF of the received signal envelope as well as the instantaneous SNR were derived for two different cases. In the first case in which \u00b5 and m were assumed to be arbitrary values, the fundamental statistics were derived in novel exact mathematically tractable closed-form expressions in terms of the Lauricella hypergeometric and Fox\u2019s H functions of four variables. On the contrary, in the second case, simple exact closed-from PDF, CDF, and G-MGF were obtained via assuming even and integer numbers for \u00b5 and m, respectively. Additionally, to gain further insights into the system behaviour, the asymptotic expressions of the statistical characterizations at high average SNR values were provided for both cases of the fading parameters. These statistics were then employed to evaluate the performance of the wireless communications systems over FBS fading channels. In particular, the OP, ABEP, EVM, CQEI, ACC, ET, AUC of ED, SOPL were analysed for different scenarios of shadowing impact, namely, heavy, moderate, and light. From all the numerical results that are compared with the Monte-Carlo simulations, one can notice that the performance becomes better when ms increases. Furthermore, all the figures have included the results for some special models of the FBS fading channel, such as, FB, \u03ba-\u00b5, and Rayleigh, that are given in Table I for validation and comparison purposes. The expressions of this paper can be used for several scenarios of composite double shadowed multipath fading channels due to their including two fading parameters for the shadowing which are m and ms."
