    "abstractText": "The most abundant form of RNA editing in metazoa is the deamination of adenosines into inosines (A-to-I), catalyzed by ADAR enzymes. Inosines are read as guanosines by the translation machinery, and thus A-to-I may lead to protein recoding. The ability of ADARs to recode at the mRNA level makes them attractive therapeutic tools. Several approaches for Site-Directed RNA Editing (SDRE) are currently under development. A major challenge in this field is achieving high on-target editing efficiency, and thus it is of much interest to identify highly potent ADARs. To address this, we used the baker yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an editing-na\u00efve system. We exogenously expressed a range of heterologous ADARs and identified the hummingbird and primarily mallard-duck ADARs, which evolved at 40\u201342 \u030aC, as two exceptionally potent editors. ADARs bind to double-stranded RNA structures (dsRNAs), which in turn are temperature sensitive. Our results indicate that species evolved to live with higher core body temperatures have developed ADAR enzymes that target weaker dsRNA structures and would therefore be more effective than other ADARs. Further studies may use this approach to isolate additional ADARs with an editing profile of choice to meet specific requirements, thus broadening the applicability of SDRE.",

The most common type of RNA editing is the conversion of adenosine (A) to guanosine (G), which can lead to protein diversification beyond the genomic DNA blueprint.

            "text": "Over the last few years, RNA modifications have become a focus of attention in many research fields. RNA editing is unique among such modifications as it alters not only the cellular fate of RNA molecules but also the genomically-encoded sequence [1\u20134]. The most abundant form of RNA editing in metazoans, including the early-diverged Cnidaria (corals), is deamination of adenosines into inosines (A-to-I) [5\u201310]. Inosines are processed as guanosines during translation, thus making A-to-I editing a powerful endogenous means of creating inner transcriptome diversity.\nA-to-I editing is mediated by members of the Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA\n(ADAR) enzyme family, which bind to specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures [11, 12]. The ADAR family consists of three enzymes: ADAR1 (also known as ADAR), ADAR2 (also known as ADARB1), and the catalytically inactive ADAR3 (also known as ADARB2). All ADARs share the catalytic deaminase domain (DD) (that is inactive in ADAR3), and one or more double-strand RNA binding domains that mediate substrate recognition. In mammals, ADAR1 is mostly responsible for editing within non-coding regions while ADAR2 is mostly responsible for the relatively few A-to-I editing that occur in protein coding regions, which may lead to non-synonymous changes in the protein products [8, 13].\nThis ability of ADARs to re-code makes them attractive therapeutic tools to correct genetic\nmutations and reprogram genetic information at the mRNA level. The prospects of utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology for therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years. This approach offers a solution to chronic conditions by introducing a life-long permanent genetic modification [14\u201316]. However, RNA editing could be a more appropriate alternative in some cases. As opposed to DNA editing mediated by CRISPR-Cas technologies, RNA editing does not require the introduction of foreign immunogenic prokaryotic proteins. In addition, genome editing approaches raise concerns of harmful consequences of off-target events, which can permanently alter genes and disrupt cellular functions [17\u201321]. In contrast, RNA editing alters genetic information in a transient and reversible manner and does not affect the genomic sequence. Thus, possible adverse effects would be reversible, making this approach safer. Furthermore, the transient nature of RNA editing is more suitable for treating conditions that are not permanent, where a temporary solution is more appropriate.\nSeveral approaches for Site-Directed RNA Editing (SDRE), utilizing ADAR\u2019s catalytic activ-\nity for RNA engineering, are currently under development. The simplest strategies use only an RNA oligo to create the dsRNA structure that would guide native ADARs to edit the target adenosine of choice [22\u201326]. However, other strategies use RNA oligos supplemented by engineered ADAR-like proteins [27\u201330]. A major challenge in this field is achieving high on-target editing efficiency [31]. It is therefore of much interest to identify highly potent natural ADARs\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661 March 6, 2023 2 / 18\nfiles.

This task is challenging, as it requires to discern the effect of the different ADAR enzymes and the effects of evolution of the targets themselves. Here we developed a novel approach to screen and identify such potent ADAR enzymes, using as a neutral testing ground the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an organism whose origin precedes the emergence ADARs and therefore does not possess an endogenous capacity for A-toI RNA editing. We exogenously expressed different heterologous ADARs to reveal their distinct editing potential and identified two exceptionally active A-to-I editors: the hummingbird ADAR2, and primarily the mallard-duck ADAR1, whose core body temperature is 40\u201342\u02daC. We provide evidence that these birds which evolved to live with higher core body temperatures have developed ADAR enzymes that target weaker dsRNA structures and would therefore be more potent than other ADARs (compared at equal temperatures)."

Accordingly, imposing editing on these cells by introduction of exogenous ADAR enzymes results in impairment of their growth rate [32]. We thus proposed to screen different ADAR enzymes using growth impairment as a probe for editing activity.\nADARs contain dsRNA Binding Domains (RBDs) that recognize RNA secondary struc-\ntures surrounding the target adenosine. The stability of these structures is temperature-dependent [33, 34], and weaker (less paired) structures are generally expected at higher temperatures. We have therefore speculated that species evolved to live with higher core body temperatures may have developed ADAR enzymes that target weaker dsRNA structures.\nEndothermic vertebrates maintain a fixed core body temperature. This body temperature is\nbetween 35 and 42\u02daC, which is 10\u201315\u02daC higher than the typical body temperature of ectothermic vertebrates [35]. We have therefore looked at ADAR1 and ADAR2 orthologs from five species\u2013two mammals and two birds, and one ectotherm invertebrate, that inhabit different environmental niches: (1) Human (Homo sapiens), whose ADARs are commonly used in base editing research [32, 36, 37]; (2) Squid (Loligo opalescens), an ectotherm invertebrate living in diverse temperatures, which was shown to have extraordinarily high levels of A-to-I editing in coding sequences [38\u201340]; (3) The marine mammal, Orca whale (Orcinus orca), with core body temperature of ~38\u02daC [41]; (4, 5) Hummingbird (Calypte anna) and Mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos), two birds with relatively high core body temperatures of ~40\u02daC and ~42\u02daC respectively, the warm end of the endothermic spectrum [42, 43].\nWe cloned each of these ten heterologous enzymes into a URA3 marked plasmid that enables their expression under the galactose inducible promoter (GAL1p) (Fig 1A and 1B). Next, we immunoblotted protein lysates samples from yeast cells carrying these plasmids and were able to validate the expression of most enzymes, except hbADAR1, owADAR1 and sqADAR1, which were most probably eliminated by the proteasome ubiquitin system or autophagy (Fig 1C). These strains were then serially diluted and spotted on galactose- and glucosecontaining media (ADAR expression is on and off, respectively) and incubated at 30\u02daC. As shown in Fig 1D, the strongest growth impairment effect was seen upon inducible expression of Orca whale ADAR2 (owADAR2), Hummingbird ADAR2 (hbADAR2), and Mallard duck ADAR1(mdADAR1).\nTo further confirm and quantitate the growth defect of these strains, we measured the opti-\ncal density of liquid cultures over 22 hours (in 30-minutes intervals) for these three affected strains, as well as two reference strains carrying the squid ADAR2 (sqADAR2) and Human\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661 March 6, 2023 3 / 18\nADAR2 (hADAR2) which have shown a weaker effect (Fig 2A). The growth curves confirmed that the inducible expression of all five ADAR enzymes resulted in differential growth impairment, with a stronger effect for owADAR2, hbADAR2, and the most discernible effect in cells overexpressing mdADAR1. No effect was detected when the same strains were grown in a glucose-containing media, where no ADAR protein expression is detected (Fig 2B).\nThe impaired growth rate of yeast cells expressing heterologous ADARs is the result of editing within yeast transcripts\nTo verify that the exogenously induced ADAR enzymes are catalytically active in the yeast cell, we sequenced RNA samples from the strains described in Fig 2 and looked for evidence of Ato-I editing. In addition, we looked at three negative controls, cells harboring an empty URA3marked plasmid, and cells expressing catalytically inactive mdADAR1 and hADAR2,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661.g001\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661 March 6, 2023 4 / 18\n(mdADAR1-E619A and hADAR2- E396A) in which a critical glutamic acid was converted to alanine. A similar mutation was shown to inhibit catalytic activity in hADAR1 [44].\nInosines are read by the reverse-transcriptase and the following sequencing protocol as gua-\nnosines. Thus, editing detection tools look for A-to-G mismatches between the reference genome and the RNA-seq reads. As a control, we looked at the number of mismatches of different types. Since our RNA-sequencing libraries were not strand-specific, there are only six possible types of mismatches (e.g., T-to-C mismatches are indistinguishable from A-to-G ones). First, we used the RES-scanner pipeline [45] followed by multiple testing correction to identify mismatch sites de-novo (see Methods). We found that the number of non-A-to-G substitutions were similar for all samples, while the number of A-to-G mismatches (presumably induced by A-to-I editing) increased substantially upon ADAR induction. For samples containing active ADARs 74\u201399% of the identified sites were A-to-G mismatches, and the number of these mismatches was at least 25-fold higher than that observed in control samples (Fig 3A). The number of editing sites per sample varied from 597 for hADAR2 (~25-fold increase from the baseline A-to-G mismatch level shown in the control samples) to 113,672 for mdADAR1 (~5000-fold increase from the baseline), which has the highest body temperature of the species screened. The detected A-to-G sites exhibit the familiar ADAR motif [46, 47] (Fig 3B). We thus attributed these mismatches to A-to-I RNA-editing events. The majority of these editing sites resides within protein coding sequences, and the distribution of editing levels is skewed towards lower values, as expected (see S1 Fig).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661.g002\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661 March 6, 2023 5 / 18\nWe wanted to further test our hypothesis that the increased number of editing sites using\nADARs originating from species with higher core body temperatures is due to targeting of weaker dsRNA structures by these enzymes. We thus looked at the thermodynamic stability of the secondary structures surrounding the editing sites detected per strain (Methods). As expected, enzymes editing more sites have also targeted sites with a lower stability (Fig 3C). In particular, the structures edited by mdADAR1 are significantly less stable that those edited by hADAR2, in agreement with our proposed model.\nIn addition, in order to obtain a quantitative comparison between the different enzymes we\nused the editing index approach (see Methods), which is less sensitive but more robust [48]. Briefly, the editing index represents the fraction of nucleotides expressed from genomicallyencoded adenosines that has been edited. Here, we have calculated the index across the full yeast genome. In the URA3 empty plasmid sample and the two inactive ADAR samples, the measured editing index was 0.023\u20130.025%, representing the baseline noise level (mainly due to\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661.g003\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661 March 6, 2023 6 / 18\ngenomic polymorphism sites). The samples expressing active ADARs exhibited elevated index values, as expected, and the increase correlated to the number of de-novo sites reported above (Fig 3D). We also quantified the RNA and protein expression levels of the ADAR enzyme in each sample (Fig 3E and 3F). While there are variations between the samples, the high editing seen for mdADAR1 is not explained by higher RNA or protein levels, and likely represents the intrinsic potency of this enzyme. Notably, for all ADAR enzymes tested, the majority of detected sites are also detected with mdADAR1 (S2 Fig).\nTo further validate these results, we sequenced again strains including empty vectors,\ninactive mdADAR1-E619A and active mdADAR1, five replicates each. The number of A-G/ T-C mismatch sites detected by RES scanner was 6\u00b12 and 18\u00b17 for the empty plasmid control strain and the mutated mdADAR1, respectively, and increased to 240,600\u00b144,700 upon induction of the active mallard duck enzyme. Similarly, editing index was similar for the empty plasmid control strain and the mutated mdADAR1 (0.0154\u00b10.0006% and 0.0161 \u00b10.0008%, respectively), but increased substantially for the active enzyme\u2013 0.313\u00b10.050% (S3 Fig).\nAltogether, we found 471,784 distinct adenosine positions that were identified as edited\nin at least one (out of five) mdADAR1 samples (S3 Table - https://docs.google.com/ spreadsheets/d/1wXGKUPB39t4P-4AiXq9ZGwfxsR_NrHcw/edit?usp=share_link&ouid= 102710005033051837999&rtpof=true&sd=true). That is, we observe editing in about 1 in 16 A:T sites in the whole yeast genome (regardless of the expression level of the locus and strand in which the adenosine resides). Of these, 85,726 sites (~18%) reoccur in all five samples (S4 Fig). Most of the sites were weakly edited, but 79,687 sites (~17%) have shown editing levels of 10% or more in at least one of the samples. Overall, the index value of ~0.3% means that ~1/300 of the adenosines expressed in the transcriptome is converted to inosine. These findings imply that in the absence of long-time adaptation in the ADAR-na\u00efve yeast genome, a sizable amount of adenosine sites are located within preferable substrates for mdADAR1 activity. These results, in agreement with the observations from cell growth assay, demonstrate the potency of mdADAR1.\nmdADAR1 and hbADAR2 carry a normal number of dsRBDs (Fig 1B). Their sequences\nexhibit multiple differences with respect to ADAR enzymes from other taxa, and it is not easy to pinpoint the source for their exceptional editing potency. To identify the domains that contribute to the unique editing capability of mdADAR1 we carried out domain deletion experiments, expressing under GAL1p constructs that include mdADAR1 with its (a) first, (b) first and second, or (c) all three dsRBDs deleted (Fig 4A). In addition, we carried out domain swapping experiments, testing the growth of strains carrying the following hybrids: (i) mdADAR1 combined with the human-dsRBDs1,2,3 (mdADAR-DD-hRBD1-3), and (ii) human ADAR1-DD combined with the md-dsRBDs1,2,3 (hADAR1-DD-mdRBDs1-3) (Fig 4B). The results show that the growth rate of strains where some or all of the dsRBMs were deleted was similar to the wt control, implying that the combination of the DD and all three dsRBDs is important for mdADAR1 editing. Furthermore, the growth of the hADAR1-DD-mdRBDs1-3 strain was also comparable to the wt. In contrast, growth was partially impaired in the mdADAR-DD-hRBD1-3 strain, even though not as much as for the full mdADAR1 strain (Fig 4C). These results imply that the mdRBDs are partially replicable by the hRBD2-3, and that the mdADAR1 catalytic domain has a larger contribution to its potency in yeast.\nTo conclude, introduction of active ADAR proteins into the ADAR-na\u00efve yeast cells resulted in editing of thousands of sites, which can be readily probed by growth impairment. Of the enzymes tested, mdADAR1 is by far the most potent one, resulting in hundreds of thousands of editing sites and a severe growth impairment.\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661 March 6, 2023 7 / 18\ndsRNA substrate recognition by heterologous ADARs in yeast are differentially disturbed by temperature change\nAs temperature decreases, shorter and imperfect dsRNA helices are stabilized, resulting in an increased number of potential ADAR substrates. All the experiments above were performed at 30\u02daC. We therefore wanted to examine the relative potency of the enzymes and the temperature-dependence for each one of them over an extended temperature regime. We focused on the yeast strain expressing: (1) mdADAR1, and (2) hbADAR2, the first and second most potent ADARs, with the greatest effect on the yeast transcriptome and growth rate, and (3) hADAR2 as a reference strain with the least effect. These strains were serially diluted and spotted on glucose- or galactose-containing media and incubated at 25\u02daC, 30\u02daC and 34\u02daC. mdADAR1 growth was severely impaired at all three temperatures, but in the case of hbADAR2 the strong growth impairment at 25\u02daC was partially and gradually restored when ramping up the temperature to 30\u02daC and 34\u02daC (Fig 5A). On glucose, when ADAR expression is off, temperature shift had minimal effect and growth was comparable to the control strain at all temperatures. Immunoblotting of protein samples originated from these cells shows that ADARs\u2019 protein levels was not affected by the temperature shift, ruling out the possibility that the effects are the results variation in protein levels (Fig 5B).\nTo complement these data, we sequenced the RNA and quantified A-to-I editing in these\nsamples as described above, looking at three replicates each time. Using RES-scanner to detect mismatches de-novo, we found that for hADAR2 and hbADAR2 the editing signal increases substantially with decreasing temperature (Fig 6A). In particular, for hADAR2, where the effect of editing on viability is the smallest of all three enzymes, the number of detected sites increases by more than an order of magnitude upon decreasing the temperature from 34\u02daC to 25\u02daC. In mdADAR1 the behaviour is more complex, presumably due to the dramatic effect of high-level editing on viability, even at the highest temperature. The editing index shows a similar pattern (Fig 6B). Here too, we verified that the increase in the number of sites edited by hADAR2 with lowered temperature is due to the stability of the secondary structures surrounding the editing sites. For each of the sites detected, we analysed the surrounding structures predicted for 30\u02daC (Methods) and found that lowering the temperature allows for editing of less stable structures, as expected (Fig 6C). In summary, the ambient temperature has a\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661.g004\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661 March 6, 2023 8 / 18\nstrong effect on editing activity, but the mdADAR1 remains the most potent enzyme even at temperatures that are far remote from its native environment.\nFinally, we looked at editing by mdADAR1 in mammalian systems. We have expressed\nhADAR2, hbADAR2 and mdADAR1 in human HeLa cells, and compared the global editing using the Alu editing index (Methods) [48]. Here too, hbADAR2 and mdADAR1 have shown an increased level of editing, much larger than the one seen for over-expression of hADAR2 (S5 Fig)."

These studies have focused on human ADARs and identified a novel set of editing substrates [32]. Furthermore, co-expression of human ADARs with selected yeast substrates have allowed for monitoring the effects of either mutations within ADAR domains or the target dsRNA structure, on the editing levels [37, 49, 50]. Here we use the yeast model system to compare a range of ADAR proteins. We detected extensive transcriptome-wide A-to-I changes, accompanied by noticeable effects on cell growth which imply a biological impact for the editing events. We thus conclude that yeast cells can be used as a screening platform to reveal the inherent potential of selected ADARs. Using this approach, we singled out the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661.g005\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661 March 6, 2023 9 / 18\nmallard duck ADAR1 as an exceptionally potent A-to-I editor, capable of editing up to hundreds of thousands of sites in the yeast transcriptome.\nADARs substrate recognition mainly depends on a duplex RNA secondary structure sur-\nrounding the target adenosine, which is recognized by ADARs\u2019 dsRNA Binding Domains (RBDs). dsRNA secondary structure is affected by the ambient temperature [33, 34], as one generally expects tighter dsRNA structures at lower temperatures. Thus, editing is expected to depend on temperature. Temperature-dependence of editing levels has been demonstrated in Drosophila [34, 51, 52]. Furthermore, several studies have established that the response of RNA editing to temperature changes may act as a means for adaptation and acclimation [39, 53]. An intriguing example is presented by the ectothermic cephalopods which show extensive RNA editing [38, 40, 54]. Nonsynonymous editing site in the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 1 (Kv1.1) was shown to depend on the ambient temperature at which the octopus species lives, suggesting RNA editing contribution to adaptation [39]. Accordingly, maintaining editing at the desired level may require adaptation of the editing substrate to the ambient temperature through mutations that modify the RNA structure stability [55].\nIn parallel, homoeothermic species could also adapt the editing enzymes to their body temper-\nature, changing their dsRNA binding and the catalytic activity to compensate for inter-species\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661.g006\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661 March 6, 2023 10 / 18\ndifferences in body temperatures. We therefore suggest that species evolved to live with higher core body temperatures have developed ADAR enzymes that target weaker dsRNA structures and would therefore be more potent than other ADARs (compared at equal temperatures).\nThe model we have in mind is as follows: Temperature affects the stability of the dsRNA structures themselves but also the binding of the enzyme to a given structure. ADARs must edit tight dsRNAs to avoid false alarming the innate immune system. Enzymes evolved at high body temperature must be active against the dsRNA structures that sufficiently tight, despite the lower enzyme-substrate affinity dictated by the high temperature. Accordingly, they are expected to be more sensitive than enzymes evolved at lower body temperatures, when compared at the same ambient temperature. In parallel, changing the temperature also increases the repertoire of tight dsRNAs, leading to an increase in the number of edits for a given enzyme (Fig 7).\nWe currently don\u2019t know what mechanism might underlie the elevated editing by the iden-\ntified ADARs. Their RNA expression level and western blot analysis rules out the most obvious\nmdADAR1 and hbADAR2 originated from birds with core temperature of 42\u02daC and 40\u02daC, the warm end of the endothermic spectrum, have probably evolved to better recognize partially destabilized dsRNA structures. Their exogenous expression in yeast stimulated the highest association with dsRNA structures and editing activity in all temperatures when compared to hADAR2 evolved at lower body temperature. Temperature increase leads to a shift in the distribution of structures, with less tight ones (green) and more partially destabilized ones (red), which is reflected in the total number of edited sites and a partial growth restoration of growth and viability in cells carrying the hbADAR2, to some extent, and mostly hADAR2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661.g007\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661 March 6, 2023 11 / 18\nexplanation, that they are highly abundant. This implies that their high editing activity is likely due to the intrinsic potency of the enzymes. They carry a normal number of RBDs, but their sequence shows multiple differences when aligned with ADARs from other taxa. Based on deletion and domain swap experiments in mdADAR1, we conclude that the existence of all its three dsRBDs is necessary, but they are not essentially different from hADAR1 dsRBDs, and the major contributor to the editing activity of mdADAR1 is the DD. Future mutagenesis experiments combined with functional and validation studies will help shed light on this question.\nThe severe growth impairment observed in mdADAR1 yeast strains highlights the potential\ngrave impact of over-editing. This raises the question of how does the mallard itself tolerate its potent native ADAR enzyme. Possibly, this enzyme is potent only when expressed at cold temperatures, but does not edit extensively at 42\u02daC. Alternatively, the mallard duck genome may have evolved to avoid dsRNA structures that could be targeted by ADAR.\nFor hADAR, we observed a clear increase of editing activity with lowering the temperature.\nExtrapolating to the native temperature of this enzyme, 37\u02daC, it seems that there would be very little editing activity in the yeast transcriptome by hADAR2. This suggests that the existence of hADAR2 editing sites have required special adaptation of the surrounding sequence to create sufficiently tight dsRNA structures that are not present, or at least are rare, in the yeast transcriptome.\nADAR-based base-editors may prove to be an attractive RNA engineering and therapeutic\ntool. Using the editing-na\u00efve system we have demonstrated the variability in activity across ADAR enzymes from different species, and identified the mallard duck ADAR as an exceptionally potent editing enzyme. Further studies may use this approach to pinpoint additional ADAR enzymes of various desired editing profile, to further broaden the applicability of ADAR-based systems."

We augmented the genome with the coding sequence of the ADAR enzymes to allow alignment of ADAR-derived sequencing reads. Insert sizes for DNAand RNA-seq samples were set to 700bp and 1,400bp respectively. A larger insert size was used for the RNA-seq samples to account for splicing events. Then RES-scanner [45] was applied for de-novo detection of RNA editing sites using default parameters, except for the following ones:\u2014editLevel 0\u2014editDepth 5\u2014ss 0. The different RNA-seq replicates were separately compared to the BY4743 WT DNA-seq. As the RNA-seq procedure did not preserved the expressed strand information, mismatches of complement types (e.g. A-to-G and T-to-C, Cto-T and G-to-A etc.) could not be differentiated and thus mismatches were classified into 6 mismatch types (e.g. T-to-C mismatches and A-to-G mismatches are counted together). The sites identified by RES-scanner were further filtered by applying a Benjamini-Hochberg correction using the raw p-values reported by RES-scanner and setting the number of multiple tests conservatively to 12 million (genome size). The editing index was calculated as described in Roth et al [48], over the whole yeast genome.\nThe following site (http://degradome.uniovi.es/cgi-bin/nVenn/nvenn.cgi) was used to gen-\nerate the Venn diagram shown in S1 Fig. For the logo motif we used: bedtools.2.27.1 and sacSer3 genome assembly.\nSecondary structures and their energies\nTo search for secondary structures that include the putative editing sites, we retrieved 801bplong genomic sequence flanking each editing sites (400bp to each side) and used FOLD program from the RNAStructure package [59] with default parameters (except for temperature which was set to 30\u02daC = 303.15K) to find the lowest energy structure. Then, the substructure surrounding the editing site was extracted using bpRNA [60], and, if it was not contiguous, we connected its two arms by 7 \u201cN\u201d base-pairs. We recalculated the free energy (\u0394G) of this\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010661 March 6, 2023 14 / 18\nsubstructure using RNAStructure, taking the most probable structure. Sites which were not located within a double-stranded substructure were assigned \u0394G = 0."
