"In conclusion, these studies were successful in determining the localization of freebase porphyrin in the tested colon cells. Besides photodynamic effects, inhibition of cell migration by porphyrins can play a crucial role in the overall mechanism of colon tumor death. Due to the low concentrations of the applied porphyrins, no changes in the cellular cytoskeleton were observed. It has been shown that the mobility of normal cells exposed to porphyrins and white light irradiation is limited. Neoplastic cells, due to their origin from the early stages of tumor development, were not characterized by an intensive migration capacity; thus, no clear effect of porphyrins on this cell feature was observed. The presence of porphyrins at low concentration in the microenvironment of normal and neoplastic cells did not significantly affect transmission via connexons. This work suggests that the influence of porphyrins on colon cell migration depends not only on the type of porphyrin (containing a metal ion or not) and the method of its excitation, but also on the type of cells they affect and, very importantly, the concentrations of these macrocyclic compounds."
