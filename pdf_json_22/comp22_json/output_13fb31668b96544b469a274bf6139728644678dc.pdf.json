    "abstractText": "To shorten the travel time and improve comfort, the automatic train driving system is considered to replace manual driving. In this article, an automatic control method of computer application dataprocessing system based on artificial intelligence is proposed. An automatic train operation (ATO) introduced the structure and function of an autopilot system (train), optimized the train running on the target curve, introduced the basic principle of fuzzy generalized predictive control (PC) algorithm, and combined with the characteristics of ATO system design the speed controller based on optimization algorithm, the target curve to make use of the designed controller to track and simulation validation. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that when the train runs to 90 s, the displacement difference reaches about 40m, which proves that the fuzzy PC has better displacement tracking, punctual arrival, and higher stopping accuracy.",

With the continuous improvement of train speed and transportation density, the traditional manual driving mode is difficult to meet the increasingly developing demand of rail transit. Automatic driving can improve the safety and reliability of train operation, improve train transportation efficiency, reduce train energy consumption, transportation cost, and driver labor intensity, etc. [2]. Urban rail transit has a high possibility to realize the level of automatic train driving because of its simple lines, less interference conditions, and advanced onboard and ground system equipment. Therefore, urban rail transit automatic train operation\nHong Wang: Scientific Research Department, Hebei Chemical & Pharmaceutical College, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050026, China, e-mail: HongWang137@163.com Lixia Hao: Information Engineering Department, Hebei Chemical & Pharmaceutical College, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050026, China, e-mail: LixiaHao9@126.com Amit Sharma: Chitkara University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chitkara University, Punjab, India, e-mail: Sharma.amit@chitkara.edu.in\n * Corresponding author: Ashima Kukkar, Chitkara University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Chitkara University, Punjab, India, e-mail: ashima@chitkara.edu.in\nOpen Access. \u00a9 2022 Hong Wang et al., published by De Gruyter.

At present, the subway basically adopts the automatic train driving system with certain intelligent control.\nAs we know, the automatic train driving system uses different control algorithms, and its control effects are also different, so it is necessary to study the optimal automatic train control (ATC) algorithm to make the train run in the best state [4]. The control strategy of urban rail train in operation is adaptive proportional integral derivative (PID) or conventional PID, so it is of great significance to the simulation research of urban rail train speed controller based on fuzzy predictive control (FPC). Due to the complexity of railway lines and the uneven degree of advanced equipment, the research degree of automatic train driving is far behind that of urban rail transit, but some research achievements have been made. The control of train running on ordinary railway is a very complicated process. The characteristics of trains under different operating conditions are completely different, and the corresponding control strategies and control objectives are also different [5]. Because the mathematical description of train running process is a multiobjective and complex nonlinear system, an accurate mathematical model and an optimal solution are difficult to obtain. To realize the high quality control of ordinary railway train operation, this study adopts the control mode combining fuzzy logic and predictive control (PC) and determines the control indexes, automatic driving strategies, and principles in the process of train operation according to the existing driving experience and expert knowledge. The running process is modeled in real time using a PC approach based on fuzzy strategy, and a reasonable and optimum automatic driving scheme is obtained. Chen et al. offered two strategies for improving the stability of strategic model training while using the least amount of manual data possible. The first method uses a modest amount of manual data to train the characteristic network with parameter initialization using reinforcement learning and imitation learning. In the second technique, auxiliary networks are added to the reinforcement learning framework, allowing it to use real-time measurement data to enhance awareness of the environment without the need for demonstrators\u2019 assistance. The end-toend autonomous drive system of image information and information of light detection and ranging is simulated to verify the effectiveness of the two approaches. We built a three-dimensional (3D) world based on the Ranger XP900 platform, the real obstacle 3D model of real models, and inertia characteristics of real motion constraints to ensure that the trained end-to-end autonomous driving model is more suitable for the real world. Experimental results reveal that the virtual game world\u2019s performance is improved by 45%, and that it can be promptly and consistently converged in the pavilion, where the earlier method failed [6].\nTo sum up, this article proposes a research on automatic control of computer application data processing system based on AI and applies fuzzy logic and PC algorithm to train automatic driving system. By studying traction calculation model, train automatic driving theory and train operation model in detail, data processing method of train operation line, operation principle, and operation strategy of train automatic driving optimization are given. The simulation results are very close to the actual results of excellent driver operating the train. It is proved that the FPC technology can ensure the high quality of train operation in the automatic train driving system.\nThe following is a breakdown of the structure of this research article. Section 2 illustrates the background of ATO system and FPC technique and related studies on ATO control algorithms. Section 3 describes the proposed design of ATO. Section 4 contains the experimental results. Section 5 describes the conclusion."

            "text": "ATO system is a component of the ATC system. The function of ATO is performed with the collaboration of each ATC subsystem. As a result, before introducing ATO, it is vital to first comprehend the composition of ATC. ATC is a collection of automatic equipment of control that may change the interval of train\u2019s running\nfor efficiency reasons and safety. The control system, which includes a control center, a station, ground equipment, and onboard equipment, completes the process control. The system is split into four parts: automatic train monitoring (ATM) system, automatic train protection (ATP) system, and the ATO system. The ATC loop control system aboard the train is composed of the ATM, ATP, and ATO subsystems and the equivalent ground supporting systems. Figure 1 depicts the system control structure. Door control, over speed protection, and speed detection are all features of the ATP system, which is the heart of the ATC system [7]. The ATO system may intelligently replace the driver and efficiently drive the train by allowing the train to smoothly accelerate to the desired speed. It can also automatically change the train\u2019s speed and bring the train to a smooth stop at the precise station location. The applicant tracking system (ATS) system can track and direct the train to ensure that it stays on track and the system remains stable. By switching turnouts, the ATS system defines the departure path and supplies monitoring commands that are given through the train arriving control room. Metro trains are becoming more densely packed, and safety standards have become increasingly stringent.\nAs a result, the train must have an ATM system. The train follows the planned schedule in a precise and organized manner. The ATM system can keep track of the train\u2019s status and make intelligent scheduling decisions. ATS is normally found in the subway line\u2019s biggest stop. The remote control system completes the connection between each station\u2019s interlocking equipment and control center. The data delivered from ATS to ATO is sent via the cable to the wayside ATP transmitting device, which is then collected and processed by the onboard ATP equipment before being sent to the onboard ATO equipment. ATO determines the running speed based on the speed of maximum permissible and actual running of ATP after gathering essential data. The quantity of control is acquired, and the command to control is issued. ATO delivers data to ATS via the position train identification subsystem, which sends information to the station\u2019s ground loop and then transmits it to ATS to determine the train\u2019s position. ATS determines the train\u2019s new task based on the train information and then passes the track circuit to the ATO. ATS regulates the train\u2019s new mission based on the train\u2019s information and then sends it to ATO via track circuit. During the interval operation, ATO achieved a critical track segment and obtains new pavement details for speed adjustments. The automatic driving procedure in the ATO system is a closed-loop feedback method. The ATP takes position and speed information from the ranging device, running task information and speed measurement from the ATS, and positioning detail from the system of positioning, transmits it, and processes it to the ATO with its own information of overspeed protection. Based on this data, the ATO provides the cruising, best control, idling, traction, and braking. Simultaneously, ATO seems to have a two-way communication structure that lets the train to communicate directly with the ATS inside the station via the ground ATO loop and vehicle antenna and transmits train-relevant data to the ATS to determine the train\u2019s position, and ATS defines the new running instruction of the train based on data. Figure 2 depicts the basic relationship block diagram [7]."

            "text": "Fuzzy control technique is driven by human experience and intuition, which means that the operator\u2019s comprehension of the controlled system is based on the operator\u2019s extensive practical experience and intuitive feeling rather than quantitative expression. This method can be thought of as a collection of experimental guidelines. The control action is inconsistent and subjective because human decision making is intrinsically ambiguous. The operator\u2019s control strategy can, however, be articulated in language to develop a set of qualitative decision rules represented in language by monitoring and conversing with the operator in the design of fuzzy control.\nThis article compiles and formalizes the knowledge and practical experience of specialists in a particular topic. Language is utilized to create a set of qualitatively conditional assertions and imprecise rules of decision, which is subsequently quantified using the fuzzy set. A controller is created that mimics human control strategies by using formal human experience rules. The controller can control complex industrial processes by driving equipment. The following components make up a fuzzy control system: a controlled object, an input/output interface, a fuzzy controller, a detecting device, and an actuator. Fuzzy and PC are two types of current control methods that control an uncertain system and are created independently. Nonlinear system based on the FPC technique is basically an organic blend of PC and fuzzy decision making, which is more in accordance with human control philosophy. People\u2019s natural concepts in dealing with complex industrial process control challenges are system prediction and fuzzy reasoning. The rationality of FPC can be explained by the following points. Both strategies are good for controlling an uncertain system, and combining prediction and fuzzy control will boost the control effect even more. The fuzzy control trend is shifting from rule to model. PC is a common model-based control method, and the object model may serve as a communication link between the two. PC is an optimal control strategy that is based on a mathematical model of an object. The precision of the analytic system, however, limits the system\u2019s complexity. PC research in a fuzzy environment is critical for expanding the PC application range."

As indicated in Table 1, we give a review of the earlier 47 researches that used control algorithms in ATO settings, extending from 1983 to 2021.\nTo address the aforementioned issues, a number of researchers have developed several ATC technologies in recent years. Different forms of train-control objectives and models, as well as different types of algorithms, are used in these studies, depending on the applications. Table 1 shows a high-level overview of these investigations. In general, these studies, can be split into two types. To synthesize or portray these experiences, one of these strategies uses empirical knowledge and professional expertise. These methods,\nwhich are referred to as intelligent and II control methods in this study, are mostly based on expert systems, data mining, or fuzzy logic algorithms to improve numerous objectives for ATO. Meanwhile, the second class of methods, referred to as PA control methods in the following discussion, uses train model information to develop an efficient speed controller to ensure trajectory tracking accuracy. In conclusion, fuzzy control shows a high level of flexibility to parameter changes, although the partition of linguistic terms and membership functions shape in control are highly dependent on expert expertise and difficult to update online. In the realm of simulation experts, the expert system is an issue. Manual transplantation is used to acquire knowledge. It is limited to solving professional difficulties in a specific field and has poor reasoning abilities. Neural network control is a nonlinear adaptive dynamic system in which neurons are interconnected. The benefit is that the challenge can be handled parallel in large scale, and the personalized learning is great; however, the process of reasoning cannot be described, and the speed of network convergence must be increased. The II algorithm avoids the flaws of the intelligent algorithms while maintaining their respective benefits, resulting in improved results [54].\nThe railway sciences of China academy have integrated the fuzzy logic, artificial intelligence (AI), and knowledge engineering technologies with the ATO system to achieved some results. Yet, the applications on the ATC system are not providing good performance. Therefore, in this study, the algorithm based on fuzzy and PC is integrated and used on the ATO."

            "text": "The main purpose of automatic train speed control is to regulate the train\u2019s braking/traction system in accordance with the ATP\u2019s goal speed. According to the system\u2019s state transition sequence, first, the ATO determines the current state of operational. Automatic speed regulation is a negative feedback closed-loop method for acceleration control and speed. The braking/traction command is output by ATO to assess the train\u2019s braking/traction condition, and the output current defines the magnitude of the traction/braking. The comfort, energy saving, efficiency, and punctuality of the entire system are all influenced by the execution of the ATO algorithm. The main concept behind the ATO FPC is as follows: First, the predictive model is used to obtain the future system\u2019s prediction output. Second, the fuzzy controller takes the prediction output value and variation rate of the prediction error between the set output value and prediction error as input. To obtain control output, the controller uses fuzzy rule logic. Further, model selftuning, fuzzy control, and model prediction are the three fundamental components of an FPC system [55].\nATO system features include automatic driving mode, train speed control, train target braking, door control, and energy-saving speed curve generation based on schedule. In autopilot mode, the ATO system completely simulates an experienced driver controlling the train from one station to the next. For train speed control, the ATO system controls and supervises the train to operate at speeds below the maximum allowable speed provided by ATP. The function of train target braking is to calculate the initial position of train braking in advance to make the train stop at the specified target position. The train door opening and closing control refers to the operation of the driver opening or closing the door after the ATO system receives the allowed opening or closing order after the train arrives and stops steadily, or automatically triggers the completion of the stop time [56]. The function of generating energy-saving speed curve according to schedule is also optional. If the train running between two stations has sufficient travel time, this function can be selected, so that the train can obtain a more economical speed to run at a uniform speed, thus saving energy."

            "text": "The function of the speed controller is to ensure that the train can follow the target curve well. When the target curve supplied by the speed controller is poor, no matter how good the performance of the designed speed controller is, the ATO system cannot achieve good performance. The advantages and disadvantages of ATO system, such as safety punctuality, comfort and energy saving, and accurate parking, are reflected in the target curve. This requires that the target curve to be tracked by the speed controller is an optimized curve, and only in this way can the actual running curve of the train be better. In this article, part of the data of eight marshaled CRH3 EMUs put into operation by a certain rail Bus Co, Ltd. are used as train model parameters, as shown in Table 2.\nIn this study, the running speed of the train in and out of the station is set as 120 km/h, the platform distance is set as 1,500m, and the maximum running speed under the interval speed limit should be slightly lower than the speed limit given by the ATP system. In this study, 305 km/h is taken, and the target speed of the train is 300 km/h. When the train target speed is 300 km/h, there is no ramp over 13.06% on the secondary line, so the maximum speed of the train during cruise operation is 305 km/h, and the minimum speed is 295 km/h. When the target speed of a train running on a straight line is 120 km/h, the maximum speed is 125 km/h, and the minimum speed is 115 km/h. After leaving the station, the train adopts the appropriate traction gear (the traction force does not exceed the adhesive traction force and can accelerate\nthe train with the maximum acceleration as soon as possible while considering the comfort) to accelerate the speed up to 300 km/h; before arriving at the station, the train takes 120 km/h as its initial speed and calculates it with the reverse iteration algorithm (the iteration step is 0.1 s). The target speed (i.e., the initial braking speed) of the train needs to make a speedy trial and match with the terminal speed in cruising operation within the speed range of 295\u2013305 km/h at the end of iteration. When the difference between the two final speeds is less than a given value, the speed is the target speed, and its corresponding position is the initial position of braking. When the train runs to the starting position of the breaking point, it uses the appropriate braking gear to slow down the train. The braking distance, including the blank walking braking distance, is 1.5 s. The calculation method of the starting position point of train braking stop is the same as that of deceleration braking. The initial speed only needs to be 0 km/h, so the basic resistance of train needs to be converted into the corresponding deceleration. The target curve of train operation can be obtained from the above train model parameters, line parameters, and software flow chart, as shown in Figure 3."

            "text": "Fuzzy generalized prediction (FGPC) algorithm is a new algorithm, which combines fuzzy logic with PC. It compensates the error of generalized prediction (GPC) by fuzzy reasoning. A basic model is established\noffline using priori information to describe the main dynamics of the prediction process. To make up for the deficiency of GPC algorithm in system information processing, the error between the actual measured and predicted information is regarded as the information of uncertainty, and the possible error in the process of PC is compensated appropriately at the high level.\nBased on GPC algorithm, FGPC algorithm directly compensates system deviation according to fuzzy reasoning. In this way, the integrated control quantity acting on the controlled object is shown in equation (9):\n( ) ( ) ( )= +u t u t u t ,1 2 (9)\nwhere u1(t) is the generalized PC quantity, and u2(t) is the control quantity for compensating system error by fuzzy reasoning. In this algorithm, the basic rule of the system is reflected by GPC control, and the output deviation caused by other interference factors or model mismatch is compensated by fuzzy reasoning. Suppose e(t) is the process output deviation at t sampling time, ec(t) is the rate of deviation change, and the process has d step pure delay, and then the fuzzy compensation control quantity is determined by e(t + d) and ec(t + d). Define e(t + d) and ec(t + d) as equations (10) and (11):\n( ) ( ) ( )+ = + \u2212 +e t d r t d y t d , (10)\n( ) ( ) ( )+ = + \u2212 + \u2212ec t d e t d e t d 1 . (11)\nFirst, fuzzy control compensation comes from process output deviation and deviation variation. Second, the process input control quantity is the sum of generalized PC quantity and fuzzy control compensation quantity. Finally, to achieve a better control effect, process input control quantity is used to control the whole system. It should be emphasized that because the optimization goal of GPC algorithm is over time, fuzzy reasoning compensation function needs to be updated online repeatedly rather than offline once [57]. Due to the use of fuzzy reasoning compensation method, it does not only retains the excellent performance of GPC algorithm but also compensates for many shortcomings of GPC algorithm such as random factors that cannot be estimated and the inaccuracy caused by the length of prediction domain is too short. The static accuracy and dynamic tracking performance of the controlled system are improved [58]. Moreover, FGPC can improve the robustness of the controlled system in the presence of strong external disturbances or time-varying parameters [59]."
