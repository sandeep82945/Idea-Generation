"Spatially variant distortions and defocusing effects caused by the wavefront curvature assumption in the CPFA become more pronounced in large scene images. To address this problem, the EPFA was developed for HRHS SAR images, adopting a new range model based on the 2-D Taylor series expansion and accounting for the wavefront curvature error."
