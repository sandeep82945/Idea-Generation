    "abstractText": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) initiate infection via binding of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) to sialylated glycans on host cells. HA\u2019s receptor specificity towards individual glycans is well studied and clearly critical for virus infection, but the contribution of the highly heterogeneous and complex glycocalyx to virus\u2013cell adhesion remains elusive. Here, we use two complementary methods, glycan arrays and single-virus force spectroscopy (SVFS), to compare influenza virus receptor specificity with virus binding to live cells. Unexpectedly, we found that HA\u2019s receptor binding preference does not necessarily reflect virus\u2013cell specificity. We propose SVFS as a tool to elucidate the cell binding preference of IAVs, thereby including the complex environment of sialylated receptors within the plasma membrane of living cells.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulate in aquatic birds, their natural host reservoir, but have also established stable lineages in various mammalian species such as pigs. Although animal IAVs usually remain confined within their natural host species, they can cause zoonotic infections in humans on rare occasions [1]. Such interspecies transmissions can result in clinically severe or even fatal respiratory disease in humans, as illustrated by the outbreaks of avian-origin H7N9 subtype viruses in China occurring since 2013 [2]. Zoonotic transmission events can, in fact, largely influence the epidemiology of human influenza\nViruses 2023, 15, 1507. https://doi.org/10.3390/v15071507 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses\nViruses 2023, 15, 1507 2 of 12\ndirectly if the virus succeeds to spread efficiently among humans, as was observed in 2009 for the pandemic swine-origin H1N1 strain (pdmH1N1) [3]. Although the genetic requirements for crossing the species barrier are still incompletely understood, it is accepted that interspecies transmission of IAVs at least partially depends on the capability of the spike protein hemagglutinin (HA) to recognize specific sialylated glycan receptors on the host cell surface [4]. In general, the HA of avian viruses preferentially binds to \u03b1-2,3linked sialic acid (SA) (avian-type receptor), whereas the HA of human-adapted strains strongly binds to terminal \u03b1-2,6-linked SA (human-type receptor) [5]. Several studies have determined that alterations in HA\u2019s receptor specificity are a crucial step in host adaptation and interspecies transmission for several IAV subtypes [4]. However, it remains speculative if those adaptive mutations result in increased virus\u2013cell binding. Glycan arrays containing a variety of synthetic glycans are widely used to characterize IAV receptor specificity with a high precision of structural glycan properties. Recent studies of the cellular glycome of the human and swine respiratory tract tissues show that its complexity might not be adequately represented by current glycan arrays [6\u20139]. Consistently, IAVs were shown to use a more diverse group of glycans [7,10] or even sialicacid-independent attachment factors [11]. Candidate molecules include C-type lectins (L-SIGN and DC-SIGN) that were found to participate in influenza virus attachment independent of SA specificity [12]. Hence, complementary approaches to directly assess viral receptor specificity within the complex environment of the cell surface are necessary to reach a more comprehensive understanding of the initial stage of virus infection. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single-virus force spectroscopy (SVFS) allows for measuring the binding of individual IAVs to living host cells at the molecular level [13\u201315]. In this type of analysis, intact viruses are covalently attached to AFM cantilevers. Cycles between the cantilever\u2013cell approach, cell binding, and cantilever retraction allow direct characterization of virus\u2013cell binding while revealing kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the interactions. Thus, SVFS allows for investigating virus\u2013cell binding in an experimental system that closely mimics the natural situation [16,17]. Using five different IAV strains (Table 1), we systematically address whether virus receptor specificity observed by glycan array analysis is reflected in virus\u2013cell binding patterns as determined by SVFS. Our results indicate that data obtained from in vitro glycan arrays may not directly reflect virus\u2013cell binding specificity. We suggest that host cell specificity does not solely depend on the sialic acid configuration of the cell surface but is more complex and depends on the specific environment of the receptor and possibly involves additional attachment factors or co-receptors with yet unknown functional roles."

Slides were incubated overnight in a humidity-saturated chamber and remaining reactive groups were quenched by incubating with 100 mM ethanolamine and 50 mM sodium phosphate at pH 9.0 for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed with water, dried by centrifugation, and stored at 4 \u25e6C until use. Before loading, the array was washed with DPBS.

Subsequently, wells were blocked with DPBS containing 1% BSA for 2 h at 4 \u25e6C and permeabilized using DPBS-T containing 0.3% Triton-X100. To stain the bound virus the array was incubated with a primary monoclonal antibody against the viral NP protein (1:1000, clone AA5H, AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) at 4 \u25e6C overnight. Primary antibody was removed, and wells were washed three times with DPBS-T. Secondary Cy3-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100, product-code: 115-165-146, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) was added and incubated at RT for 1 h.

The Petri dish with cells was mounted with the AFM, which was put on the optical microscope through a specially designed XY stage. Before force measurements, the cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 10 pN/m functionalized with influenza A virus was incubated in 5 mg/mL BSA for 30 min in order to minimize the nonspecific interaction between the cantilever tip and the cell surface. Measurements were performed\nViruses 2023, 15, 1507 4 of 12\nin PBS buffer at room temperature. After the cantilever tip approached the cell surface, force\u2013distance curves were repeatedly measured with Z-scanning range of 2 \u00b5m, cycle duration of 0.5\u20138 s, 500 data points per curve, and typical force limit of about 40\u201370 pN. The spring constants of the cantilevers were determined by using the thermal noise method [19]."

            "text": "Similar to single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), also in SVFS studies, several hundred force\u2013distance cycles are recorded in a dynamic range of increasing loading rates under identical conditions. For each of these force curves showing unbinding events, the unbinding force Fi and the effective spring constant ke f f (slope at rupture) were determined. The loading rates r were determined by multiplying the pulling velocity v with the effective spring constant ke f f (i.e., r = v \u2217 ke f f ). Additionally, a rupture force probability density function (pdf) (Figure 3B) was calculated, and a Gaussian distribution was fitted to the main peak of the pdf. Subsequently, all unbinding events within \u00b5 \u00b1 \u03c3 of the fit were selected to create a loading rate dependence scatter plot (Figures 3C and S2) for further calculations of ko f f and xu. Generally, the loading rate r is constant for a fixed pulling speed, which implies that the effective spring constant ke f f does not vary significantly. However, for force spectroscopy measurements on live cells it is known that ke f f could show a broadened distribution caused by local variations in the spring constant of the cell surface, leading to a convolution of the rupture force distribution and further influencing the calculations for the dissociation rate constant, ko f f , and the separation of the receptor-bound state to the energy barrier, xu. To circumvent this influence, we applied a maximum likelihood routine to fit the SVFS data to the Evans model [20] in order to obtain ko f f and xu (Table 2). According to the single energy barrier binding model, the probability p that the complex breaks at a certain force, F, is given as [21]:\np(F) = ko f f\nr exp [ Fxu kBT \u2212 ko f f kBT rxu ( exp Fxu kBT \u2212 1 )] (1)\nThe parameters xu and ko f f were determined by applying a maximum likelihood approach, in which the negative log likelihood nll was minimized by modifying ko f f and xu, with p based on Equation (1) defined in the single barrier model [21]:\nnll = \u2212\u2211 t\nlog p ( ko f f , xu, Ft, rt )\n(2)\nWe want to point out that the model from Friddle and De Yoreo [22] is a more recent formalism that could be used as an alternative to the single energy barrier binding model used here. For reasons of comparability with our previous SVFS work on live cells, we used the Bell\u2013Evans model for all our data in this study."

While pdmH1N1 bound the \u03b1-2,6 conjugates equally well, it showed reduced binding to the \u03b1-2,3 conjugates, overall suggesting a preference of \u03b1-2,6 conjugated sialic acid. While a dual binding behavior was already observed before for pdmH1N1 (A/California/04/2009 and A/Hamburg/5/2009) [23,24], the receptor binding preference of the AH1 isolate is still under debate. It was shown that AH1 exhibits increased human receptor binding while still preferring avian receptors [25], and others reported on the specificity for human-type receptors [26]. The avian H7N1 isolate A/FPV/Rostock/1934 (FPV) recognized all three avian-type conjugates, but bound only one human-type conjugate, which is in line with previous findings using glycan arrays [27]. We further tested H3N2/X31 as well as H1N1/WSN. H3N2/X31 carries the HA of the human pathogenic IAV strain A/Aichi/68, which was also previously shown to prefer \u03b1-2,6-linked (human-type) receptors [28]. In line with that, we found that H3N2/X31 only recognized human-type SA conjugates on the glycan array. The lab-adapted H1N1/WSN was previously shown to prefer \u03b1-2,6-linked (human-type) receptors over \u03b1-2,3-linked SA on re-sialylated erythrocytes [29]. In our hands, H1N1/WSN bound all six receptors with no obvious preference. Interestingly, among all glycans, we observed the strongest binding for pdmH1N1, H1N1/WSN, and AH1 to the kinked, fucosylated SLeX (Figure 1). SLeX, mostly known to be involved in leukocyte binding, was identified in human respiratory tract tissue [8]\nViruses 2023, 15, 1507 6 of 12\nincluding A549 cells [30] and shown to be recognized by different IAV subtypes [31]. In particular avian H7 IAVs [32]. The avian-origin FPV (not tested in [32]) was shown to recognize only the sulfated form of SLeX [31], which could explain the absence of binding in our experiments. We also included six glycans without terminal sialic acid on our glycan array (Figure 1, right side). While we indeed observed virus binding, it was on average 10\u2013100-fold lower compared to the sialylated glycans, indicating that our tested viruses require terminal sialic acid for improved binding. We next used SVFS to characterize virus binding to two different model cell lines, A549 and CHO. A549 cells are derived from the lower human respiratory tract and express both major SA receptor types on the cell surface, as shown by lectin binding [14]. CHO cells lack an \u03b1-2,6-specific sialyltransferase and only express \u03b1-2,3-linked SA [33]. Hence, we chose them as a comparative model for studying viral binding to cells displaying only avian-type receptors [14,18]. The presence of both glycans on the respective cell types was confirmed by fluorescent lectin staining using Sambuccus nigra agglutinin (SNA, specific for \u03b1-2,6-linked SA) and Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA, specific for \u03b1-2,3-linked SA) (Figure S1). For SVFS, intact viruses were covalently attached to AFM cantilevers using a bifunctional crosslinker (Figure 2A).\nViruses\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 6\u00a0

forces, functionalized cantilevers were lowered on adherent cells until touching the cell surface, then raised again until the formed interaction was broken and detected as a jump of the force vs. distance curve (Figure 2C). Binding to cells was measured in a dyna ic range of increasing loading rates r, i.e., pulling velocities to determine the dissociation rate at zero force koff. nbinding events were recorded and analyzed to obtain the rupture force F as well as the effective spring constant keff, defined as the slope of the force\u2013distance curve at rupture (Figure 3A). A typical rupture force histogram and the accompanying probability density function (pdf) of the interaction between influenza AH1 and A549 cells are shown in Figure 3B. During this experiment, we detected a binding probability of 29.7% (v = 500 nm/s). A typical spherical influenza A virion has approximately 300 HA trimers, i.e., 900 sialic acid binding sites [34]. On the cellular side, SA is a ubiquitous glycan, as we also show by lectin binding (Figure S1). We thus hypothesize\nViruses 2023, 15, 1507 7 of 12\na high chance of HA\u2013SA binding during virus\u2013cell attachment. Reducing the SA density on the cell surface should thus only reduce the probability of HA\u2013SA binding but not the overall measured force. After cell surface SA depletion by neuraminidase (NA) treatment, the binding probability was reduced to 5\u201313%, while the pdf peak position was unchanged (red curves and inset in Figure 3B), indicating the specificity of our measurements. The binned histograms are shown for comparison along with the fitted pdf.\nViruses\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 12\u00a0

om keff, the loading rate r (i.e., force per time) was calculated b multiplication ith the retraction velocity v. Notably, we used an adapted dat analysis pr cedure, which takes the variable local conditions of a living cell surface into account [20]. Briefly, although the loading rate r should be constant for a given pulling speed v, recent studies have shown that the heterogeneity of a living cell surface leads to a broad distribution of observed loading rates [20]. Hence, to account for this effect, our approach does not rely on binning of loading rates but takes each individual force\u2013distance curve into account as shown for AH1 virus\u2013A549 cell interactions (Figure 3C). By fitting the force spectra to a single energy barrier model (Figure 3C, see Section 2), we obtained the thermodynamic properties of the interaction (summarized in Table 2). The dissociation rate koff and its reciprocal, the bond lifetime \u03c4off, provide information about the stability of the underlying virus\u2013cell interaction.\nTable 2. Dissociation rate koff, separation from the energy barrier xu, and average bond lifetime \u03c4off obtained by fitting the SVFS data to a single energy barrier binding model as described in Materials and Methods (see also Figure 3D).

However, we found an about 40% reduced dissociation rate for A549 compared to CHO cells, indicating preferential binding of human-type cell surfaces (Table 2). We confirmed this binding preference of AH1 by measuring binding to living MDCK cells, which express, similar to A549 cells, both human- and avian-type receptors (Figure S3). We observed preferential binding to MDCK cells compared to CHO cells. For FPV, we observed about three times lower dissociation rates compared to AH1, with preferential binding to A549 (see Table 2). The pdmH1N1 virus showed similar dissociation rates as FPV, but without pronounced cell type preference. A comparison of the mean unbinding force at 4 \u00b5m/s pulling velocity is shown for all virus\u2013cell combinations in Figure S4. While we found the lowest mean unbinding force for AH1, pdmH1N1 and H7N1/FPV show unbinding forces 4\u20136 times larger, possibly indicating an affinity difference. The high unbinding forces are in agreement with the lower off rates for pdmH1N1 and H7N1/FPV compared to the other virus\u2013cell pairs. We have studied H3N2/X31 and H1N1/WSN before by SVFS [14] but now reanalyzed our data using the improved fitting procedure described above. Although we found quantitative differences between the two analysis methods, they are in qualitative agreement, leading to the same conclusions. The fitting values are reported in Table 2, and a comparison with the previously used analysis is summarized in Table S1. H3N2/X31 showed stronger attachment to CHO cells, while binding of H1N1/WSN to A549 and CHO cells was almost identical."

It is not well established how HA\u2019s receptor specificity affects virus\u2013cell binding. The plasma membrane is a complex environment with a high diversity of glycans and other potential virus attachment molecules that may affect IAVs\u2019 cell specificity. We have performed a comparative study combining glycan array binding to evaluate the receptor specificity of various IAV strains along with testing their cell specificity using SVFS. While our glycan array results are largely in line with previous findings using similar assays [23\u201329,31], the SVFS results (Table 2) suggest that HA\u2019s preference for human- or avian-type receptors does not necessarily correlate with the expected binding patterns to model cell lines mimicking the surfaces of human or avian cells (see below). For pdmH1N1 and H1N1/WSN, we found that the SVFS data (for H1N1/WSN see [14]) are in good agreement with results obtained from glycan array binding, as neither strain displayed a strong preference for human- or avian-type receptors or a particular cell model. However, we observed contradicting preferences for H3N2/X31, AH1, and also for FPV. We found H3N2/X31 to preferentially bind avian-type cell surfaces, while only recognizing \u03b1-2,6linked (human-type) receptors on the glycan array. AH1, similar to pdmH1N1, recognized\nViruses 2023, 15, 1507 9 of 12\nboth receptor types on the glycan array and showed good binding to all six presented specific glycans on the array, while SVFS indicated a preference for human-type cell surfaces (Table 2). FPV recognized all three avian-type receptors but only one human-type receptor on the glycan array, while showing preferential binding to human-type cell surfaces in SFVS. However, binding to the recognized human-type receptors (receptor 3 in Figure 1) was about two- to three-fold stronger when compared to the avian-type receptors (receptor 5 in Figure 1), which might explain the stronger binding to A549 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that HA\u2019s receptor preference as tested in glycan array binding has to be considered with caution when concluding on the preferred binding to human-type over avian-type cell surfaces. Our findings described above raise the possibility that non-sialic acid receptors could contribute to a larger than expected extent to virus\u2013cell binding. The concept of nonsialylated receptors being involved in IAV infection is intriguing and under discussion; since the observation of IAV infection in desialylated cells [11] and due to advanced glycomics [7], the idea has received more attention recently. However, SVFS analyses of cells after pre-treatment with neuraminidase to remove sialic acid structures showed that the binding probability was strongly reduced, leaving the unbinding force unchanged (Figure 3B). This indicates that the viruses indeed mainly bind to sialic acid of the cell surface, but that the local organization and environment of the receptors or other cell surface molecules alter the macroscopic cell specificity leading to the observed differences. The nanoscale organization of specific IAV-binding glycans was investigated before using superresolution microscopy showing compartmentalization at the scale of an individual IAV particle (<100 nm) [35]. Nanoscale imaging together with more specific labeling approaches and refined glycomics will help to better explore how viruses attach to live cells. The stronger binding of AH1, pdmH1N1, and H1N1/WSN to the fucosylated glycan SLeX in comparison to the other \u03b1-2,3-linked (avian-type) SA of our glycan array is indicative for the relevance of the glycan topology, as also found previously [36]. From the viral point of view, cumulating evidence suggests a role of the viral neuraminidase (NA) in contributing to cell binding via sialic acid [37]. Reiter-Scherer et al. recently used AFM-based force spectroscopy to compare sialic acid binding to either NA or HA and found a strong interaction between NA and sialic acid [38]. In our SVFS measurements, NA was kept unperturbed and, hence, it cannot be excluded as a binding mediator, a feature that could be tested in future experiments."

            "text": "Recent glycomics approaches and the use of ex vivo tissue culture revealed new insights into the complexity of the living cell surface [7,8]. Since sialic acid was first identified as an influenza virus attachment factor, many studies have focused on HA\u2013 SA binding. Although this interaction is important, not only infection of desialylated cells [11] but also the recent characterization of non-SA binding HA encoded by a batderived H17N10 virus [39], in addition to the discovery that the 1918 pandemic virus unaffectedly binds to primary human airway cells even when its HA is engineered to bind exclusively to avian-type SA receptors [40], suggested that other molecular determinants within the plasma membrane are also critical in initiating influenza A virus infection. For characterizing virus specificity, we suggest a dual complementary approach: (1) in vitro binding assays with synthetic glycans to precisely identify the preference of HA (or NA) for a specific sialic acid structure and (2) SVFS as demonstrated here to unravel the cell specificity, modulated by the local environment of the living host cell. Notably, fluorescent soluble HA trimers represent an elegant alternative to probe HA specificity to living cells [41]. We have recently demonstrated this complementary approach for an adapted mutant of pdmH1N1 [18]. While glycan array analysis could not identify a switch in receptor preference, SVFS revealed that the adaptive mutation in HA strongly reduced the binding strength without changing the cell specificity. These binding properties are not accessible and might be hidden when only using in vitro specificity assays. The use\nViruses 2023, 15, 1507 10 of 12\nof new methods such as SVFS [16] and ex vivo tissue culture in combination with global glycomics and proteomics approaches could help to identify essential components of the plasma membrane facilitating influenza virus\u2013cell interaction.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v15071507/s1, Figure S1: Surface sialic acid characterization by fluorescence confocal microscopy; Figure S2: Overview showing force vs. loading rate scatter plots for all virus-cell combinations; Figure S3: SVFS dynamic force spectra of H7N9 AH1 interacting with single receptors on living MDCK cells; Figure S4: Comparison of the mean unbinding force at pulling velocity 4 \u00b5m/sec, Table S1: Comparison of SVFS results obtained by using two different fitting approaches.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.S. and A.H.; methodology, M.K., A.K.
