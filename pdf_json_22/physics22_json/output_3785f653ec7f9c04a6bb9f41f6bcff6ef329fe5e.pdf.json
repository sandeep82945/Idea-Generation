            "text": "tRPC have traditionally been used with a relatively low particle flux (<< kHz/cm2) due to the inherent limitation to the counting rate imposed by the commonly used float glass electrode resistivity. Since tRPCs are one of the main large-area timing detectors, extension of its counting rate capability is of great interest for future High Energy Particle (HEP) experiments, were the luminosity is expected to increase considerably.\nAttempts have already been made to increase the count rate capability by using materials with lower electrical resistivity compared to the commonly used float glass, such as ceramics [1, 2], special glasses [3] or some technical plastics [4]. As a result, the operation of small area detectors was successfully achieved, but the implementation of the medium/large area detectors failed due to the lack of homogeneity of the materials, which present low electrical resistivity paths, resulting in an unstable behavior of the detector. Another possibility, still very little explored, is to decrease the resistivity of standard float glass by\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n12 19\n9v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. in\nsde\nincreasing the operational temperature of the detectors, providing a ten-fold decrease in resistivity every 25\u25e6C [5].\nThis communication describes test beam result, focusing on detection efficiency and timing precision, of common float glass tRPCs exposed up to incident particle fluxes up to 1500 Hz/cm2 and operated up to 40.6\u25e6C."

            "text": "The experimental arrangement consist of four individually shielded strip-like tRPC stacked one on top of the other, see figures 1.a and 1.b. Each individual chamber consists of three aluminum (2 mm thickness) and two glass (soda-lime) electrodes with a length of 750 mm and two different widths 22 mm (RPC1 and RPC4) and 44 mm (RPC2 and RPC3). Two of the chambers (RPC3 and RPC4) are equipped with 1 mm glass, (bulk resistivity of \u2248 4x1012 \u2126cm at 25 \u25e6C) while the others (RPC2 and RPC1) are equipped with 2 mm thick glass (bulk resistivity of \u2248 10x1012 \u2126cm at 25 \u25e6C). All of the electrodes have rounded edges and the glass exceeds the aluminum in size by 1 mm (in both dimensions) to prevent discharges, see figures 1.b and 1.c. The gap is defined by PEEK (Polyetheretherketone) mono-filaments of 0.270 mm diameter, spaced approximately by 100 mm along the chamber. The ensemble is housed inside individual aluminum tubes (shielding) and compressed by springs on top of each mono-filament that apply a controlled force through a PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) plate that distributes the force.\nHigh-voltage (HV) close to 6 kV is applied to the central aluminum electrode via 1 M\u2126 resistors and high voltage cables, while the outer electrodes are grounded and the glass electrodes are kept electrically floating. Insulation to the shielding tube walls is assured by a triple-layer KAPTON\u2122 adhesive laminate. An end-shield made of aluminium foil is glued to both ends of the aluminium tube to produce a fully shielded element. The signals are collected, at both ends of each chamber, by coaxial cables through 2 nF HV coupling capacitors and extracted from the gas box through the front panel via RF MMCX connectors.\nThe gas box is equipped with temperatures sensor and a heating element, capable to increase the working temperature homogeneously in the inner chambers up to at least 40.6\u25e6C. A set of fast plastic scintillators define a beam line (telescope). The telescope is composed of three paralalepipeds 80 x 30 x 20 mm3 scintillators (Bicron BC420), SC1, SC2 and SC3 placed as it is sketched in figure 1.e), read out each of them by two fast PMTs (Hamamatsu H6533). The 20 mm side faces the beam passing through 30 mm scintillator for maximum timing precision.\nBoth tRPC and the PMTs signals are feed to fast Front End Electronics (FEE) [7] (for PMT readout the amplification stage was removed) capable of measuring time and charge in a single channel. The resulting signals are read out by the TRB board [8] equipped with 128 multi-hit TDC (TDC-in-FPGA technology) channels with a time precision better than 20 ps.\nThe chambers were operated in open gas loop with a mixture of 97% C2H2F4\nand 3% SF6, exposed to 2.7 GeV proton beam, with a typical diameter of 40 mm, fluxes up to 1500 Hz/cm2 and working temperatures up to 40.6\u25e6C. Since the gain of an tRPC depends on the pressure and temperature of the gas, the applied HV is modulated as a function of these two variables according to [9] in order to keep the gain constant."

For each particle detected in the tRPC i, the following variables are computed: time as Ti = (Til + Tir)/2, where Til and Tir are the left and right times and charge as Qi = (Qil +Qir)/2, with Qil and Qir the left and right charges. Any time differences involving Ti are corrected as a function of Qi using the typical slewing correction. Similar procedure is followed for the scintillator signals. tRPC timing precision, \u03c3RPCi , is calculated by performing the time differences among tRPC and the two front cintillators, SC1 and SC2, in the telescope and resolving the following system\nof equations: 1 1 01 0 1 0 1 1 \u03c32RPCi\u03c32SC1 \u03c32SC2  = \u03c3 2 \u2206RPCi\u2212SC1 \u03c32\u2206RPCi\u2212SC2 \u03c32\u2206SC1\u2212SC2  (1) where \u03c3RPCi , \u03c3SC1 and \u03c3SC2 are the time precision of RPC i, SC1 and SC2 and \u03c3\u2206RPCi\u2212SC1 , \u03c3\u2206RPCi\u2212SC2 and \u03c3\u2206SC1\u2212SC2 are the sigma of time difference distribution of RPCi \u2212 SC1, RPCi \u2212 SC2 and SC1 \u2212 SC2. Typical calculated timing precision for the scintilators is around 35 ps sigma. Efficiency, i, of each individual tRPC, is calculated as the ratio of the number of events with signal in both ends of a given tRPC i and the number of events with signal in the three scintillators in the telescope. The SC1 scintillator has a vertical width of 20 mm, while the RPC1 and RPC4 have 22 mm, therefore a misalignment between the tRPCs and the scintillator can create geometric inefficiencies, as will be shown below. In addition, due to the small size of the telescope, the efficiency obtained should be understood as a lower limit."

            "text": "Figures 2.a and 2.b show the efficiency and timing precision as a function of the incident particle flux density at a working temperature of 21\u25e6C and reduced electric field of 443 Td. Both figures show the loss of efficiency and deterioration of timing precision as the incident particle flux increases from 100 Hz/cm2 up to 1500 Hz/cm2. Apart from the already mentioned difference in efficiency (due to geometrical reasons) between the 22 mm and 44 mm tRPCs, it is observed that the tRPCs with 2 mm glass (RPC2 and RPC1) lose efficiency much faster and have a worse timing precision. This difference is due to two factors. On the one hand the thickness of the glass and on the other hand the resistivity itself which is 2-3 times lower in the 1 mm glass, giving in combination a factor of 4-6 in resistance.\nFigures 3.a and 4.a show the efficiency of the tRPC with 2 mm and 1 mm thick glass respectively as a function of the incident particle flux from 100 Hz/cm2 up to 1500 Hz/cm2 for three different working temperatures 21\u25e6C, 30.5\u25e6C and 40.6\u25e6C. The efficiency recovery with increasing operating temperature (due to decreasing resistivity) is evident being much higher for the 1 mm chambers (due to lower resistance) becoming basically independent of the incident particle flux (at least up to 1500 Hz/cm2) for a temperature of 40.6\u25e6C. Chambers built with\n2 mm glass show only a modest recovery. Figures 3.b and 4.b shows the time precision for the same conditions mentioned for efficiency. Again, the recovery in timing precision is observed as the operating temperature increases, being more evident for the 1 mm chambers, remaining at a level of approximately 100 ps up to 1500 Hz/cm2."

            "text": "In this work we have shown that increasing the working temperature of a tRPC can substantially improve its counting rate capability. In particular, individually shielded strip-like tRPC with an active area of 750 x 44 mm equipped with 4 gaps of 0.270 um, show the same efficiency, close to 90%, and timing precision, close to 100 ps, over a range of incident particle fluxes up to 1500 Hz/cm2 when their working temperature is raised to 40.6\u25e6C. This contrasts with a 20 percentage points loss of efficiency and a worsening of temporal precision of more than 60 ps when operated at 21\u25e6C.\nThis way of improving the counting rate capability of a tRPC detector can be very interesting as it allows to extend its counting rate capability in a very\nsimple way."
