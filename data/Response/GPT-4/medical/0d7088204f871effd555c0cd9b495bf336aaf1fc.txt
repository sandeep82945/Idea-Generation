Enhancement of Carbon Coating Quality on LFP Particles: Investigate advanced coating techniques to improve the uniformity and quality of the carbon coating derived from NC, aiming to enhance the electrochemical performance of LFP/C composites. This could involve exploring alternative sources of nanocellulose, varying the carbonization conditions, or employing post-treatment methods to increase the conductivity and stability of the carbon layer.

Development of Hybrid Nanocomposites with Additional Functional Nanomaterials: Incorporate other functional nanomaterials, such as graphene, conductive polymers, or metal nanoparticles, into the LFP/C composites. These materials could provide additional pathways for electron transport or serve as structural supports to improve the mechanical stability and electrical conductivity of the cathode material.

Scale-Up and Optimization of the Synthesis Process for Industrial Applications: Address the challenges associated with scaling up the microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis process for commercial production. This includes optimizing the reaction parameters for large-scale operations, ensuring the reproducibility of the material properties, and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the process compared to conventional synthesis methods.

Comprehensive Lifecycle and Environmental Impact Assessment: Conduct a detailed lifecycle analysis (LCA) of the LFP/C composites, from raw material extraction through to end-of-life recycling or disposal. This research would assess the environmental footprint of the composites, identifying areas for improvement in sustainability, and exploring recycling strategies for the cathode materials to promote circular economy principles in battery manufacturing.

Exploration of LFP/C Composites in Other Energy Storage Applications: Beyond electric vehicles, investigate the suitability of LFP/C composites for other energy storage applications, such as grid energy storage systems, portable electronics, or wearable devices. This research could involve tailoring the material properties (e.g., particle size, carbon content) for specific applications and evaluating performance under different operating conditions.
