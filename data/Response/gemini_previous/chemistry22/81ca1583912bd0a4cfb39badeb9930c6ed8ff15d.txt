1. **Investigate the effects of different storage conditions on the stability and bioavailability of bioactive compounds in digestate.** This could be done by conducting long-term storage studies and analyzing the changes in the concentration and activity of bioactive compounds over time. This information would be valuable for optimizing storage conditions to maximize the preservation of bioactive compounds and their potential benefits.


2. **Explore the potential of using digestate as a source of novel bioactive compounds.** The study identified several bioactive compounds in digestate that have potential applications in agriculture and medicine. Further research could focus on isolating and characterizing these compounds and evaluating their biological activities in more detail. This could lead to the development of new products and technologies that utilize digestate as a sustainable source of bioactive compounds.


3. **Investigate the effects of digestate storage on the microbial community.** The microbial community in digestate is responsible for the degradation of organic matter and the production of bioactive compounds. Changes in storage conditions could affect the composition and activity of the microbial community, which could in turn impact the quality and stability of digestate. Research in this area could help to identify microbial indicators that can be used to monitor the quality of digestate and to develop strategies to maintain a healthy microbial community during storage.


4. **Evaluate the potential of using digestate as a soil amendment or fertilizer.** Digestate is a rich source of nutrients and organic matter, which can improve soil health and fertility. However, the effects of digestate application on soil properties and crop growth can vary depending on the storage conditions. Research in this area could help to develop guidelines for the safe and effective use of digestate as a soil amendment or fertilizer.


5. **Investigate the potential of using digestate as a feedstock for bioenergy production.** Digestate contains a significant amount of organic matter that can be converted into biogas or other forms of bioenergy. Research in this area could focus on developing technologies for the efficient conversion of digestate into bioenergy and evaluating the environmental and economic benefits of this process.
