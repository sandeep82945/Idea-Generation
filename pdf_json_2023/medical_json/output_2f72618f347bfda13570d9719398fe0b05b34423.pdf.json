    "abstractText": "Background: Pancreatic surgery has been associated with important postoperative morbidity, mortality and prolonged length of hospital stay. In pancreatic surgery, the effect of poor preoperative nutritional status and muscle wasting on postsurgery clinical outcomes still remains unclear and controversial. Materials and Methods: A total of 103 consecutive patients with histologically proven carcinoma undergoing elective pancreatic surgery from June 2015 through to July 2020 were included and retrospectively studied. A multidimensional nutritional assessment was performed before elective surgery as required by the local clinical pathway. Clinical and nutritional data were collected in a medical database at diagnosis and after surgery. Results: In the multivariable analysis, body mass index (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.59, p = 0.039) and weight loss (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06\u20131.29, p = 0.004) were associated with Clavien score I\u2013II; weight loss (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.27, p = 0.027) affected postsurgery morbidity/mortality, and reduced muscle mass was identified as an independent, prognostic factor for postsurgery digestive hemorrhages (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 0.72, p = 0.03) and Clavien score I\u2013II (OR 7.43, 95% CI 1.53\u201344.88, p = 0.018). No association was identified between nutritional status parameters before surgery and length of hospital stay, 30 days reintervention, 30 days readmission, pancreatic fistula, biliary fistula, Clavien score III\u2013IV, Clavien score V and delayed gastric emptying. Conclusions: An impaired nutritional status before pancreatic surgery affects many postoperative outcomes. Assessment of nutritional status should be part of routine preoperative procedures in order to achieve early and appropriate nutritional support in pancreatic cancer patients. Further studies are needed to better understand the effect of preoperative nutritional therapy on short-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing pancreatic elective surgery.",

Worldwide, exocrine pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer death in both sexes [3]. Among pancreatic cancer patients, survival rates are much better in those who have undergone surgery than those who are unresectable [4]. Regrettably, less than 20% of pancreatic cancer patients will be eligible for resectable surgery [5]. This low resection rate\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1958. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15081958 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nis strongly linked to an advanced cancer stage, the location of the tumor, patients\u2019 comorbidities and an impaired performance status [4]. Indeed, in pancreatic cancer patients, poor oral nutritional intake, catabolism due to malignancy and reduced intestinal absorption because of obstruction or exocrine insufficiency can synergically affect nutritional status and lead to malnutrition and loss of muscle mass [6]. These in turn worsen the patients\u2019 nutritional and performance status and their suitability for surgery. Pancreatic surgery has been associated with important postoperative morbidity, mortality and prolonged length of hospital stay [7\u201310], primarily linked to pancreatic anastomotic leak [11]. Even though technological advances in surgical techniques and perioperative management have greatly improved the mortality rate after pancreatic resection, postoperative morbidity continues to be a significant critical issue [12\u201314]. Pancreatic resection has been identified as one of the most complex surgical procedures as a result of the extended resection, the resulting metabolic stress and the comparatively high rate of complications. This specific kind of surgery strongly modifies metabolic activities and nutritional conditions by triggering inflammation, stress hormones and cytokines. In this specific clinical setting, nutritional status before surgery can also affect postsurgery clinical outcomes. Indeed, in cancer patients, impaired muscle mass before pancreatic surgery is associated with worse long-term survival [15\u201318]. However, the effect of preoperative poor nutritional status and muscle wasting on postoperative complications, in-hospital mortality and length of stay still remains unclear and controversial; furthermore, studies on heterogeneity and risk of bias limit the strength of this conclusion [16\u201319]. Further research in this area is needed to obtain a definitive answer. Our retrospective observational study aims to investigate the association between nutritional status before pancreatic elective surgery and short-term clinical outcomes in cancer patients."

Patients with histologically proven carcinoma undergoing elective pancreatic surgery in University Hospital of Modena from June 2015 through July 2020 were consecutively included and retrospectively studied. No neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered to enrolled patients. Nutritional assessment was performed before elective surgery as required by local clinical pathway. Oral food intake was assessed by 24 h recall in order to define energy and protein intake. A 24 h dietary recall (24HR) is a structured interview that aims to collect detailed informations and knowledges about all foods, beverages and oral nutritional supplements consumed by patients in the last 24 h. Food models, images and other visual aids were used to support patients in judging and describing volume of portions. Energy requirement was defined in line with European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines on nutrition in cancer patients [20]. Before surgery, computed tomography (CT) scan was performed in order to stage cancer disease and define muscle mass. Diagnosis of cancer-related malnutrition (CRM) was detected in line with Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria [21], which include three phenotypic criteria (unintentional weight loss, reduced body mass index and loss of muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (inflammation and reduced energy intake or absorption). To diagnose malnutrition, at least one phenotypic and one etiologic criterion must be identified [21]. Phenotypic metrics for staging severity of malnutrition as Stage 1 (moderate) and Stage 2 (severe) were available [21]. Clinical and nutritional data were collected in medical records and the hospital electronic medical database at diagnosis and after surgery, including the following variables: age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), unintentional weight loss %, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score, kind of surgery, operation time and vascular resection.\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1958 3 of 11\nPostsurgery clinical outcomes (length of hospital stay, morbidity, in-hospital mortality, 30 days reintervention, 30 days readmission, pancreatic fistula, biliary fistula, delayed gastric emptying and digestive hemorrhage) were recorded for all patients.

The associations between length of hospital stay and the patients\u2019 characteristics were assessed using linear regression models, whereas logistic regression models were adopted to investigate the associations with respect to the other outcome measures. In the first place, for each outcome, we performed univariable analyses, and then, when appropriate, a multivariable model was estimated, considering all subjects with nonmissing data. The covariates included in the multivariable models were selected based on the results obtained from the univariable analysis and their clinical importance. In particular, for each outcome, all variables that were statistically associated with that outcome (nominal p-value less than 0.05) were selected; furthermore, the main clinical variables of this study, such as the reduced muscle mass indicator, were included. Subsequently, covariates with high association with respect to other covariates were excluded from the models to avoid issues of multicollinearity. Regarding propensity scores, they were used to estimate the probability that a subject has reduced muscle mass, holding other covariates constant. The selection of covariates for the propensity scores was carried out using the same methods described above. A multivariable logistic regression model was then estimated by including in the propensity score model that the variables potentially associated with reduced muscle mass. Results were reported as the mean difference (MD) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Analyses were carried out using R 4.2.1 statistical software."

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was the most prevalent (76.6%) cancer diagnosis and Vater papilla adenocarcinoma was the second most frequent (10.5%) histological diagnosis. Concerning surgery, pancreaticoduodenectomy was the most common (61.2%) procedure. A vascular resection was performed in 21.2% of surgery. Mean operation time was about 430 min. Regarding nutritional status before surgery, the mean BMI was 24.6 kg/m2 (DS \u00b1 4.6), and unintentional weight loss was detected in 70.5% of the population. An unintentional weight loss higher than 5% was detected in 56.8% of our population. The mean SMI was 43.24 cm2/m2 (DS \u00b1 13.3), the mean SMI in females was 39.89 cm2/m2 (DS \u00b1 10.7) and the mean SMI in males was 48.24 cm2/m2 (DS \u00b1 9.96). A condition of reduced muscle mass was observed in 56.3% of patients. A total of 48% of patients showed an energy oral intake of less than 75% of the daily energy nutritional requirement; differently52% of patients showed an energy oral intake of more than 75% of the daily energy nutritional requirement. Cancer-related malnutrition (CRM) was recognized in 75.7% of patients, in line with GLIM criteria (one phenotypic and one etiologic criterion). Nutritional parameters are summarized in Table 2. Regarding postsurgery outcomes, the mean length of hospital stay was 16.2 (\u00b111.8) days. We observed a prevalence of 73% (number 73) for postsurgery morbidity and 1.9% (number 2 events) for in-hospital mortality. A Clavien score of I\u2013II was recognized in 53.5% (number 54 events) of patients, and the prevalence of digestive hemorrhage was 10% (number 10 events).\nMissing values were excluded from calculations.

            "text": "Pancreatic resection has been identified as one of the most complex surgical procedures as a result of the extended resection, the resulting metabolic stress and the comparatively high rate of complications. This specific kind of surgery strongly modifies metabolism and nutritional status by triggering inflammation, stress hormones and cytokines [23]. In order to support proper tissue healing and recovery or maintenance of organ functions after surgery, an effective anabolic response and adequate qualitative and quantitative nutritional substrates are required. Malnourished patients deplete their nutritional reserves quickly, which thereby affects their recovery and healing [23]. The development and progression of CRM can be associated with reduced oral nutritional intake and/or increased catabolism [24,25]. Recently, malnutrition has been defined through (one phenotypic and one etiologic criterion) weight loss, low body mass index, muscle wasting, poor energy intake and increased catabolism, in line with GLIM criteria [21]. In our study, the prevalence of CRM before surgery was very high (75.7%); as supposed by some preliminary publications [26\u201328], unintentional weight loss, low BMI, loss of muscle mass and Onodera\u2019s prognostic nutrition index (PNI) have been identified as possible independent prognostic factors for several adverse clinical outcomes after pancreatic surgery. In particular, BMI (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.59, p = 0.039) and weight loss (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06\u20131.29, p = 0.004) were associated with Clavien score I\u2013II, while weight loss before surgery (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.27, p = 0.027) affected postsurgery morbidity/mortality. Our results also highlight the effect of reduced muscle mass before pancreatic surgery on postoperative clinical outcomes, since muscle mass before surgery has been identified as an independent, negative prognostic factor for postsurgery digestive hemorrhages (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 0.72, p = 0.03) and Clavien score I\u2013II (OR 7.43, 95% CI 1.53\u201344.88, p = 0.018).\nMany publications improperly define sarcopenia only as a condition of reduced muscle mass without performing muscle function measurements as required [29\u201334]. In addition, different tools are available for the assessment of sarcopenia, and the interpretation of results across studies is particularly difficult [16,34]. In pancreatic cancer patients, the impact of preoperative loss of muscle mass on the surgical outcome is still unclear and controversial [16\u201319], and available publications show several limitations. In particular, studies included patients receiving pancreatic surgery for both benign and malignant diseases, and not all studies used comparable parameters (different methods, tools and/or cutoffs) to define reduced muscle mass; moreover, a comprehensive nutritional assessment was not performed [16\u201319] as required [29,34]. Otherwise, in order to reduce the bias described above, in our study, all included patients had a histologically proven carcinoma, and a global assessment of nutritional status was achieved for each patient before elective pancreatic surgery to diagnose CRM. Furthermore, a quantitative CT analysis of muscle mass was performed by applying the most widely used cutoff for reduced muscle mass as parameter to define malnutrition as recommended [17,19\u201322,34]. Indeed, our study was carried out in a high-volume institution for pancreatic surgery, and all the main adverse clinical outcomes after pancreatic surgery were taken into account. Unfortunately, the retrospective design of this study limits the strength of its conclusions, and for this reason, these findings definitely need to be confirmed in a larger prospective study. Our findings strongly support the relationship between poor nutritional status before pancreatic surgery and short-term adverse clinical outcomes, since not only CT-detected reduced muscle mass but also unintentional weight loss and BMI could negatively affect several short-term clinical outcomes in pancreatic surgery. Further research is needed to better evaluate the effect of severity of malnutrition before surgery on short-term clinical outcomes. Although they overlap, sarcopenia, reduced muscle mass and CRM are different conditions, the term sarcopenia is unfortunately extensively used to define two different clinical situations: muscle wasting alone and reduced muscle mass associated with an impaired muscle function [29]. This is a significant source of doubts, confusion and mistakes in the research field and in many clinical settings. Some recent studies have investigated the single effect of the depletion of skeletal muscle mass on short-term clinical outcomes after pancreatic surgery, achieving unclear and controversial results [15\u201319]. Our findings greatly highlight the need to take not only muscle wasting into account, but all the diagnostic parameters for malnutrition as required by GLIM criteria [21], as part of a nutritional assessment before elective pancreatic surgery. It should also be remembered that a large number of nutritional assessment tools and scores are available to properly identify cancer patients with malnutrition in surgical settings. Nevertheless, it is still unclear which of these tools are the most appropriate and careful in predicting postoperative adverse outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients [35]. For a long time, hematological biomarkers of status of visceral proteins and liver function have also been used as indicators of impaired nutritional status. Nevertheless, the real predictive efficacy of these biomarkers still remains unclear [36]. Additional research is needed in this area. Notably, it is strictly recommended that all cancer patients undergoing pancreatic surgery should receive an early, comprehensive and multidimensional evaluation of their nutritional status before elective surgery [23]. Our research supports the advice to assess nutritional status before and after major pancreatic surgery using a validated tool. A multidimensional and comprehensive nutritional assessment is required in order to detect early muscle wasting and/or malnutrition, in line with GLIM criteria, which include three phenotypic criteria (unintentional weight loss, reduced body mass index and loss of muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (inflammation and reduced energy intake or absorption) [21].\nIn malnourished patients and in patients at risk of malnutrition, nutritional therapy should be started prior to major cancer surgery, even if operations must be delayed. A period from 7 to 14 days can be suitable [37]. In addition, after elective pancreatic surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy is often indicated to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. A large number of available publications in this specific clinical setting have reported an impaired response, a reduced tolerance and worse survival rates in pancreatic cancer patients with reduced muscle mass [16]. In light of this, during pancreatic surgery, the early prevention of malnutrition and/or proper perioperative nutritional therapy for CRM is required in order to improve tolerance to antineoplastic therapy and clinical outcome. In this situation, the introduction of a Nutritional Oncology Board (NOB) in daily practice, aimed at a multidisciplinary assessment of patients and at implementing an early nutritional therapy from oncological diagnosis onward seems to be the right path to take [6]. The NOB, sharing common experiences, goals, obstacles and unmet needs, can be an optimal fertile ground for the birth of collaborative research activities. Indeed, the NOB aims to enhance a shared pathway of care from both a clinical and an organizational point of view, and ideally to also improve awareness towards clinical nutrition [6]."

CRM is a well-known risk factor for surgery-related complications. In cancer patients, before and after pancreatic surgery, proper and appropriate recognition and management of CRM are central clinical concerns and warrant a specific and multidisciplinary (clinical nutrition, oncology, surgery) approach to improve clinical outcomes. The measurement of nutritional status supported by CT analysis of body composition parameters, especially the muscle component, should be a gold standard for preoperative assessment in order to achieve early and appropriate nutritional support. Further studies are needed to better understand the effect of preoperative nutritional therapy on short-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing elective pancreatic surgery.\nAuthor Contributions: Conception and design: R.M., F.V., A.P. and R.C.C.
