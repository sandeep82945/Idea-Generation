            "text": "Molecular spintronics is an emerging interdisciplinary research eld that has attracted an increasing amount of attention in recent years since it may allow the development of nanoscale devices with improved performance or new functionalities.1\u20133 One of the greatest challenges in the eld is to nd new materials that have suitable properties to enable an efficient generation, transport and storage of spin information.\nMolecular systems are promising since modern synthesis allows molecules to be tailored with atomic precision. Furthermore, molecular systems have sharply dened electronic states, the manipulation of which could bring functionalities which are not necessarily accessible in the case of solids.4\u20136 If the desired properties for a possible application are known, suitable molecular systems can thus be developed. However, in order to establish design guidelines for the development of such materials, it is important to know how the\nty of Freiburg, Albertstra\u00dfe 21, 79104 physchem.uni-freiburg.de aiser-Wilhelm-Platz 1, 45470 Mu\u0308lheim an\nmation (ESI) available.

This transition corresponds to the HOMO\u2013LUMO transition of the chromophore and exhibits a high transition dipole moment. In the presence of the radical, the triplet ground state T0 of the chromophore may then be generated by radical-enhanced intersystem crossing (EISC).10 The requirement for this partially allowed transition is the formation of a correlated doublet state between the chromophore and the stable radical, rather than the coexistence of two isolated systems with different spin multiplicities. The chromophore S1 / T0 transition can then be seen as a D2 / D1 transition, which is spin-allowed. Finally, the Q0 state can be generated by intersystem crossing from the D1 state.11\u201314\nIf the exchange interaction JTR between the chromophore triplet and the radical doublet surpasses all other magnetic interactions in the system signicantly, the molecular system is said to be in the strong coupling regime.13,14 Depending on the sign of JTR, the quartet state Q0 may be lower in energy than the\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The energetic order of the doublet and quartet states (sign of JTR) as well as the magnitude of JTR will determine the magnetic properties of the system and therefore its suitability for different applications. Consequently, to guide the design of these highly modular molecular three-spin systems, detailed knowledge of the factors governing the interaction between the triplet and radical spin centres will be essential.\nExperimentally, the excited state exchange interaction in such systems is frequently difficult to determine. Transient electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy can be used for this purpose, but a reliable value for JTR can only be obtained as long as JTR is smaller or of the same order of magnitude as other magnetic interactions in the system.15,16 Once the strong coupling regime is reached, where pure quartet and doublet states are formed, the magnitude of JTR has no inuence any more on the shape of the transient EPR spectrum and only a lower bound for JTR is obtained. Experimental data is thus only available for a small subset of the hitherto investigated systems and it seems natural to take recourse to computational methods that allow systematic studies on the properties of these materials to be performed.\nIn this work, we present a robust computational method for the prediction of the exchange interactions JTR in photoexcited chromophore\u2212radical systems. The approach, based on a CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculation, is generally applicable for any three-spin system and suitable for molecules up to a size of about 250 atoms.\nThe methodology is applied to a series of perylenes covalently attached to different stable radicals and the trends in JTR are carefully analysed. Further, we illustrate how the phenomenological exchange interaction JTR can be decomposed into three individual exchange interactions Jij (cf. Fig. 1) by using an effective Hamiltonian that corresponds to the Heisenberg\u2013Dirac\u2013Van-Vleck Hamiltonian.17,18 This approach enables a more detailed analysis of the factors inuencing the\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

Our results further indicate that most of the perylene\u2212radical systems are antiferromagnetically coupled and that the symmetry of the magnetic orbitals is likely to be one of the main factors determining the sign of JTR."

            "text": "There are different approaches to calculate the exchange interactions. One of the most popular approaches is broken symmetry DFT, which is a single-determinant method.19\u201322 The exchange coupling constants are estimated by only using the energy of the high spin determinant and the energy of the broken symmetry determinant. If the Yamaguchi approach is applied, also the expectation value of the total spin hS2i is required.23\nThe disadvantage of this method is that an appropriate functional has to be found for a specic problem in order to compute reliable results, which makes this method unsystematic.24 In addition, the BS-DFT method delivers unphysical spin densities that require projection methods to be used before physical observables can be calculated.25\nUnfortunately, not every system can be benchmarked, since it is frequently not possible to determine the exchange interactions experimentally. As such, BS-DFT can only be applied to electronic ground states, or a limited number of excited states that would not face variational collapse during the selfconsistent eld optimisation. TD-DFT does not alleviate the problem, since it cannot deal with complex spin couplings. However, it is noteworthy that a certain subset of open shell states can be addressed by the spin-ip TD-DFT method.26,27\nHence, the calculation of exchange interactions is most rigorously addressed theoretical by using genuinely multideterminantal methods to calculate the ground- and possibly also excited states.18\nCommonly used methods of this type include the CASSCF (complete active space self-consistent eld) and CASCI (complete active space conguration interaction) methods.18,28\u201333 Both methods have in common that the orbitals are divided into three sub-classes: the internal orbitals, which are occupied exactly twice, the external orbitals, which are not occupied, and the active orbitals, which can have any occupation number between zero and two. In the subspace of the active orbitals, a full conguration interaction is carried out, yielding a qualitatively correct wavefunction if the active space is properly chosen.\nIf quantitatively accurate results are required, it is necessary to also account for dynamic electron correlation. Very precise values for the exchange interactions can for instance be achieved with multi-reference conguration interaction (MRCI) methods such as DDCI (difference dedicated conguration interaction) or broken symmetry coupled cluster (BS-CC) methods.24,32,34 However, since the computational effort is very high, MRCI or CC methods can only be applied to very small molecules. Furthermore, MRCI methods are subject to size-\nChem. Sci., 2022, 13, 12358\u201312366 | 12359\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 1\n9 Se\npt em\nbe r\n20 22\n.

            "text": "The motivation for this study was the determination of the excited state exchange couplings in a series of perylene-based molecules as shown in Fig. 2. In this series, perylene is covalently bound to seven different radicals, which are commonly used in experimental studies on molecular three-spin systems.45\u201354\nThe goal was to determine the inuence of the nature of the radical on the magnitude of the exchange interaction(s) and to verify whether systematic trends can be identied.\nPerylene was chosen as a representative example for a choromophore since its photophysics is well-known, it is highly photostable and can be substituted easily following established protocols.55 With regard to the computational effort, perylenebased systems are relatively easy to calculate due to the small size and rigidity of the chromophore, which is convenient when wanting to compare a large number of molecules. We also examined a second series of molecules, which contains only perylene\u2013BPNO and perylene\u2013BDPA structures, but with linkers of different lengths. This second series is shown in the ESI\u2020 and allows us to comment on the inuence of the linker length on JTR.\nIn order to nd a suitable computational procedure, we started by calculating the exchange interaction JTR for two previously investigated perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, which are linked to BPNO radicals,48 using different approaches, including restricted open-shell CIS (ROCIS) and\n12360 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 12358\u201312366\nCASSCF with and without a QD-NEVPT2 correction. The structures are shown in Fig. 3 and only differ with respect to the orientation of the BPNO substituent attached to the imide position of PDI (meta vs. para). Experimentally, a change in sign of JTR between the para- and meta structures is suggested, inferred from an inverted spin polarisation of the central line (mS \u00bc +1/2 4 \u22121/2 transition) in the transient EPR spectra of the formed quartet states.13,48 Since quartet state formation was observed, also a lower bound for JTR of 0.4 cm\u22121 can be given, assuming that JTR is about ten times larger than the zero-eldsplitting of a PDI triplet state of 1100 MHz.56,57\nFor the comparison of the different computational approaches, the structures were optimised at the B3LYP/def2TZVP level of theory.58\u201360 We used the quasi-restricted orbitals from DFT calculations for the active space selection in CASSCF calculations, whereby the active space was dened by the chromophore HOMO/LUMO, and the radical SOMO. For the CASSCF/ QD-NEVPT2 and ROCIS calculations the def2-TZVP basis set was used. Further computational details are given below.\nThe experimentally observed sign and change in sign of JTR between the para- andmeta structures could be reproduced with the CASSCF/QD-NEVPT2 calculation, showing that the results using this method are qualitatively correct. The ROCIS calculations were judged less reliable since they predicted a ferromagnetic coupling for both structures. Using CASSCF/QDNEVPT2, a JTR value of 0.49 cm\n\u22121 was calculated for PDI\u2013 para\u2013BPNO, while for PDI\u2013meta\u2013BPNO a value of \u22121.3 cm\u22121 was obtained.\nUnfortunately, it is more difficult to judge the agreement regarding the calculated magnitude of JTR, since no accurate experimental reference values are available. In the abovementioned experimental study, jJTRj was estimated to be larger than 3 cm\u22121 for both the meta and para compounds based on structural comparisons with a number of different biradical compounds for which J could be determined.48 Assuming that this estimate is correct, this would imply that the CASSCF/QD-NEVPT2 calculation underestimates JTR by roughly a factor of six which is in line with theoretical studies predicting an underestimation of the exchange coupling by up to an order of magnitude.41\nAlthough JTR is underestimated, the correct prediction of the sign, sign change and trend is highly promising. In addition, any higher-level methods (e.g. MRCI) that could likely yield more accurate results would be computationally unfeasible for molecules of the considered size. Consequently, we settled on the use of CASSCF/(quasi-degenerate)-NEVPT2 for the calculation of the exchange interactions in the perylene series (cf. Fig. 2).61 The\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The exact procedure is discussed in the following.\n2.2 Decomposition of the phenomenological exchange interaction JTR\nThemagnetic interactions in a quantummechanical system can be described by the Heisenberg\u2013Dirac\u2013Van-Vleck Hamiltonian:62\u201364\nH\u0302HDVV \u00bc X\ni\\j\nJij S\u0302iS\u0302j ; (1)\nwhere Jij is the exchange interaction between the electrons i and j, whereby the subscripts 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the chromophore HOMO, radical SOMO, and chromophore LUMO, respectively. S\u0302i and S\u0302j are the spin operators for the corresponding electrons. In case of a three-electron-three-centre problem, the Hamiltonian reads:\nH\u0302HDVV \u00bc \u2212J12S\u03021S\u03022 \u2212 J23S\u03022S\u03023 \u2212 J13S\u03021S\u03023. (2)\nApplying the three-electron-three-centre HDVV-Hamiltonian on the neutral determinants, the Hamiltonian can be written in its matrix representation as follows:17\nDiagonalisation gives the eigenvectors, which are the jQ0i, jD1i and jD2i states (with mS \u00bc 1/2), and the eigenvalues, which are the energies of these states.17\njQ0i \u00bc 1ffiffiffi 3 p \u00f0jaabi \u00fe jabai \u00fe jbaai\u00de; (3)\njD1i \u00bc 1ffiffiffi 2 p \u00f0jaabi jabai\u00de; (4)\njD2i \u00bc 1ffiffiffi 6 p \u00f0jaabi \u00fe jabai 2jbaai\u00de: (5)\nEQ0 \u00bc 1\n4 \u00f0J12 \u00fe J23 \u00fe J13\u00de; (6)\nED1 \u00bc 1 4 \u00f0J12 \u00fe J23 \u00fe J13\u00de 1 2 X ; (7)\nED2 \u00bc 1 4 \u00f0J12 \u00fe J23 \u00fe J13\u00de \u00fe 1 2 X ; (8)\nwith:\nX \u00bc (J212 + J213 + J223 \u2212 J12J13 \u2212 J12J23 \u2212 J13J23)1/2. (9)\nAs can be seen from eqn (6\u20138), there are only two linearly independent energy differences, which are dened by three independent constants. As a consequence, it is not possible to\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ncalculate the J-couplings only by the energy differences of the eigenstates without any further assumptions. But assumptions could be made on the basis of the structure/symmetry.17\nAssuming that the exchange interaction between the HOMOelectron of the chromophore and the electron of the stable radical J12 equals the exchange interaction between the LUMOelectron of the chromophore and the electron of the stable radical J23, one can dene:\nJTR \u00bc J12 \u00bc J23. (10)\nIf J13 $ JTR, then the energy difference between the states Q0 and D1 can be expressed as:\nEQ0 ED1 \u00bc 3\n2 JTR; (11)\nwhich is the same expression as one would obtain from the Lande\u0301 pattern using:41\nE(S) \u2212 E(S \u2212 1) \u00bc \u2212J$S. (12)\nUnfortunately, these assumptions are not necessarily fullled and could lead to a erroneous description of JTR. Instead we will dene JTR as:\n3 2 JTR \u00bc 1 2 \u00f0J12 \u00fe J13 \u00fe J23\u00de \u00fe 1 2 X ; (13)\nwhere the term on the right-hand side corresponds to the energy difference of Q0 and D1, but without the assumption of eqn (10). Here, JTR is directly connected to the energy difference, obtained from the ab initio calculation, whereas according to eqn (11), JTR is equal to J12 and J23 or approximately to the average of J12 and J23.\nIn order to extract the individual exchange interactions, an effective ab initio Hamiltonian has to be constructed that corresponds directly to the HDVV-Hamiltonian. Using this approach, one has to project the target states onto a model space, which consists of the neutral determinants jaabi, jabai and jbaai. Then, the projected wavefunctions need to be orthonormalised, such that an effective Hamiltonian can be constructed with the obtained orthonormal wavefunctions.17,18,65\nFrom the ab initio calculation, the states 4i and the corresponding energies Ei are obtained using the Schro\u0308dinger equation within the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation:\nH\u03024i \u00bc Ei4i. (14)\nThen, the target states 4i need to be projected onto the model space S using the projection operator P\u0302S, which is dened as:\nP\u0302S \u00bc XN\nS\njIihI j; (15)\nwhere I is an orthonormal basis of the model space S. In this case, it is composed of the neutral determinants jaabi, jabai and jbaai.\nApplication of the projection operator on the target states 4i gives the projected states 4S,i:\nChem.

There are different approaches for this orthogonalisation. In order to obtain a Hermitian effective Hamiltonian, a Lo\u0308wdin orthogonalisation is applied on the projected basis, using:66\n4S;i \u00bc S 1=2 4S;i ; (17)\nwhere S is the overlap matrix with:\nS \u00bc 4S;i 4S;j : (18)\nWith the orthonormal basis at hand, the matrix elements of the effective Hamiltonian are calculated using:\nH\u0302 eff I ;J \u00bc XN\ni\nI 4S;i Ei 4S;i J ; (19)\nwhere I and J are indices for the neutral determinants. Now, the matrix elements of the obtained effective Hamiltonian can be compared directly with the HDVV-Hamiltonian, which allows for the estimation of J12, J13, and J23. The quality of the effective ab initio Hamiltonian can be veried by estimating the shi of the single diagonal elements compared to the diagonal elements of the model Hamiltonian. If the shi remains constant between the single diagonal elements, the Hamiltonian model describes the investigated system well."

The photophysical mechanism on which the selection of the active orbitals is based is also illustrated in Fig. 1.\nFor the calculation of the excited states, which were used to construct the effective Hamiltonian, we carried out a state averaged CASSCF(3,3) calculation with a QD-NEVPT2\n12362 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 12358\u201312366\ncalculation on top, in order to account for dynamic electron correlation. The calculations were sped up by the RI-JK approximation for the coulomb and exchange integrals.71 As starting orbitals we used the orbitals obtained from the TD-DFT calculation. The optimised active orbitals were localised by a Foster-Boys localisation,72 which allows for an easier interpretation of the excited states. All excited state calculations were also performed using the ORCA 5.0.3 program.\nRegarding the choice of the active space, we would like to point out here, that, in studying such systems, it is important to rst understand the nature of the low-lying excited states by carefully assessing their orbital contributions. Initially, this may involve a limited amount of trial and error. However, once the relevant orbitals for the state of interest have been established, we are of the school of thought that the smallest active space that leads to a qualitatively correct description of these states is the preferred one."

            "text": "In this section, we will rst focus on the phenomenological exchange coupling constant JTR of eqn (13), the value of which can be obtained almost directly from the ab initio calculation.\nWe will then consider the individual exchange interactions J12, J13, and J23 extracted from the effective Hamiltonian, which corresponds to the HDVV-Hamiltonian. The methodology is presented taking the perylene\u2013BPNO radical as an example. The individual exchange interactions of the remaining compounds of our series can be found in the ESI\u2020.\n4.1 Calculation of JTR\nFig. 4 shows the calculated exchange couplings JTR for all compounds of the series. The values are shown for the optimisation performed using the def2-SVP basis set. The calculations on the structures optimised using a larger basis set (def2TZVP) provide very comparable results for all structures. With the exception of the perylene\u2013TEMPO compound, a slightly smaller absolute value is predicted for JTR using def2-TZVP. The corresponding values can be found in the ESI\u2020.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 4, a relatively strong dependence of the exchange interaction on the radical type is predicted. The absolute values of the computed exchange interaction jJTRj range from close to zero (e.g. perylene\u2013TEMPO) to >10 cm\u22121 for perylene\u2013BPNO. Most perylene\u2212radical systems are\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 1\n9 Se\npt em\nbe r\n20 22\n.

Only the perylene\u2013proxyl system and the perylene\u2013eTEMPO system are ferromagnetically coupled. Interestingly, both of these radicals are asymmetric towards the chromophore\u2212radical bonding axis, which is not the case for the remaining antiferromagnetically coupled compounds. This suggests that the symmetry of the magnetic orbitals might be crucial for the resulting sign (and magnitude) of the exchange interaction JTR. Compared to the inuence of symmetry, the extent of electron delocalisation appears to play a minor role when visually comparing the tetrathiaryl compound and the BDPA compound, or the proxyl compound and the TEMPO compound.\nAs shown in the ESI,\u2020 a dependence on the linker length can also be observed, whereby a larger linker length causes a reduction in the exchange interaction. This trend is to be expected from the exponential distance dependence of exchange interactions since the main effect of a longer linker will be the increase in distance between the interacting spin centres. An exception would only occur here if the radical electron were also delocalised over the linker, which is conceivable, since the energy difference between the linker HOMO and the radical SOMO decreases with increasing linker length, making the mixing of these orbitals more likely."

            "text": "In order to better understand the rather large differences in magnitude and sign of the calculated exchange interactions JTR within the perylene series and to be able to interpret them in a meaningful way, it is advisable to consider the individual contributions to JTR. We will illustrate the procedure using the perylene\u2013BPNO system as an example.\nFirst, the target states of the ab initio calculation will be projected onto the subspace of the neutral determinants and normalised (see also section 5 in the ESI\u2020 for additional details and an excerpt of the corresponding output le). We obtain:\nThe projected target states are not necessarily orthogonal,\nconsequently a Lo\u0308wdin orthogonalisation is applied on these states using eqn (17). The states are then renormalised, which gives the orthonormalised states:\nThe quality of the orthonormalisation can be veried by simply calculating the overlap matrix S. The off-diagonal elements of S should ideally be zero, or at least close to zero.\nFor the calculation of the effective ab initio Hamiltonian, we need to consider the calculated energies of the target states, whereby we will set the energy of the Q0 state to zero.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nUsing the coefficients of the target states and their energies, the effective Hamiltonian can be constructed according to eqn (19), which can also be represented as:\nH\u0302 eff I ;J \u00bc XN\ni\nci;I ci;J$Ei; (20)\nwhere c are the coefficients for the determinants I of the states i. Using this Equation, we obtain the following effective Hamiltonian:\nAll values are given in cm\u22121. Now the individual exchange couplings can be extracted from this effective Hamiltonian, since it has a one-to-one correspondence to the Heisenberg\u2013 Dirac\u2013Van-Vleck Hamiltonian. The following exchange couplings are obtained:\nJ12 \u00bc 25:6 cm 1 J13 \u00bc 6866 cm 1 J23 \u00bc 1:11 cm 1:\nIt should again be mentioned, that the subscripts refer to the predened spin centres. Fig. 5 shows a visualisation of the corresponding localised spin centres. In the case of the perylene\u2013BPNO system, the size of the individual exchange interactions can be explained by such a visualisation of the spin centres in a relatively straightforward manner. Electrons from spin centres that are closer together show a larger exchange interaction compared to those that are farther away. By visual analysis of the orbitals, without numerical considerations, it can be stated that J12 will likely be larger in magnitude than J23. The interpretation of the sign of the individual exchange interactions, on the other hand, is more difficult. However, as already noted above, the sign is likely to depend on the symmetry of the individual spin centres.\nWe would like to emphasise here, that the orbitals shown in Fig. 5 are their localised representations. In order to ensure a consistent assignment of the spin centres for all molecules in our series, the spin centres were not assigned according to their\nChem.

If J13 $ JTR, then we can approximately express JTR as the average of J12 and J23:\nJTR z J12 \u00fe J23\n2 : (21)\nAs a consequence, if we want to modify the exchange interaction JTR, we have to focus mainly on J12 and J23. In order for the exchange interaction JTR to become minimal, J12 and J23 must either trivially approach zero or they must cancel each other out. However, in order for the exchange interaction JTR to be maximised, J12 and J23 must either have the same sign or one of the two exchange interactions must be signicantly larger. The latter can presumably be achieved by lowering the molecular symmetry, e.g. by appropriate asymmetric substitution."

            "heading": "5 Conclusions",
            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the rst study dealing with the problem of calculating the exchange interaction JTR in the excited state of molecular three-spin systems, which turned out not to be an easy task. For example, the frequently used broken symmetry DFT method would fail on such systems, since they cannot be sufficiently described with a single ground state determinant. Furthermore, high-level methods as for example the DDCI3 method are only feasible for very small structures and therefore not applicable for the molecules investigated here. We have found a robust method that is relatively fast and easy to apply while providing reliable trends for the exchange interaction in excited triplet\u2212doublet systems.\nWe could show that most of the investigated excited perylene\u2212radical systems are predicted to be antiferromagnetically coupled, whereby asymmetric chromophore\u2212radical systems (regarding the chromophore\u2212radical bonding axis) exhibit a ferromagnetic coupling. By extracting the individual exchange couplings using an effective Hamiltonian that corresponds to the Heisenberg\u2013Dirac\u2013Van-Vleck Hamiltonian, we could analyse the phenomenological exchange interaction JTR in more detail. We showed that the exchange interaction JTR can be expressed as the average of the two chromophore\u2013radical exchange interactions (J12 and J23). As a consequence, any future optimisation of JTR should mainly focus on controlling these two contributions.\nFuture investigations in our group will focus on the decomposition of the individual exchange couplings, which are still effective parameters. From this decomposition we will get valuable information on the direct exchange and the kinetic exchange contributions,18,43,73 which is needed in order to understand the signs of the individual exchange interactions. Further, we will examine the symmetry of the magnetic orbitals and its inuence on the exchange interactions.\n12364 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 12358\u201312366"
