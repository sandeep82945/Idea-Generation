    "abstractText": "The oxidative stability of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) depends on its composition, primarily, phenolic compounds and tocopherols, which are strong antioxidants, but also carotenoids, squalene, and fatty acids contribute. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of malaxation conditions and olive storage on the composition of \u2018Corbella\u2019 EVOO produced in an industrial mill to determine which parameters and compounds could give more stable oils. Although a longer malaxation time at a higher temperature and olive storage had a negative effect on the content of \u03b1-tocopherol, squalene, flavonoids, lignans, phenolic acids, and phenolic alcohols, the antioxidant capacity and oxidative stability of the oil were improved because of an increase in the concentration of oleacein (56\u201371%) and oleocanthal (42\u201367%). Therefore, these two secoiridoids could be crucial for better stability and a longer shelf life of EVOOs, and their enhancement should be promoted. A synergistic effect between secoiridoids and carotenoids could also contribute to EVOO stability. Additionally, \u2018Corbella\u2019 cultivar seems to be a promising candidate for the production of EVOOs with a high oleic/linoleic ratio. These findings signify a notable advancement and hold substantial utility and significance in addressing and enhancing EVOO stability.",

            "text": "A serious problem affecting edible oils is lipid oxidation, a major cause of deterioration of chemical, sensory, and nutritional properties. Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is highly resistant to oxidative degradation, due to a low content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), as well as the presence of phenolic compounds and tocopherols [1]. Nevertheless, the variable composition of EVOOs means their resistance to oxidative deterioration also differs. The main factors affecting the fatty acid (FA) profile and triacylglycerol composition of EVOO are the climate in which the olives are cultivated, their cultivar, and stage of maturity when harvested [1]. Parameters of interest are the ratios of MUFA/PUFA and oleic/linoleic acids, which give information about the oxidative stability and rancidity of the oils [2]: the higher the values, the more stable and less rancid they are. The two ratios\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1776. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12091776 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1776 2 of 17\nare correlated, as oleic acid is the main MUFA and linoleic acid the principal PUFA in olive oil. As the autoxidative stability of oleic acid is 10-fold higher than that of linoleic acid [3], olive oils with high oleic and low linoleic acid content are better from both a nutritional and technological standpoint. Accordingly, the generation of new olive cultivars producing oils with a high oleic/linoleic ratio is a priority in olive breeding programs [2]. The minor unsaponifiable fraction of EVOO contains two main groups of compounds that act as primary inhibitors of oxidation: phenolic compounds and tocopherols. Phenolic compounds are hydrophilic antioxidants only found in olive oils if they are virgin, as they are lost during the refining process. The highest contributors to oxidative stability in EVOO are o-diphenols such as hydroxytyrosol and its oleoside forms (oleuropein, oleuropein aglycone, and oleacein) [1,4]. Tocopherols are lipophilic antioxidants that reduce lipid oxidation as well as photooxidation [1]. The major tocopherol in olive oil is \u03b1-tocopherol, with \u03b2- and \u03b3-tocopherol found in minor amounts. The major constituent of the unsaponifiable fraction in olive oil is squalene, which has a lower antioxidant activity compared to phenolic compounds and \u03b1-tocopherol. It acts at low or moderate temperatures, and in combination with \u03b1-tocopherol and phenolic compounds [1]. Chlorophylls and carotenoids are the pigments responsible for the color of olive oil. In the presence of light, chlorophylls and their derivatives are the most active promoters of photosensitized oxidation in EVOO, contributing greatly to its susceptibility to oxidation [5]. Nevertheless, they show antioxidant effects in the dark [6]. In contrast, carotenoids, especially \u03b2-carotene, are strong protectors against photosensitized oxidation, acting as singlet oxygen quenchers [5]. Among the principal factors affecting EVOO composition are the cultivar, ripeness, and health of the olive fruits, agroclimatic conditions, the production process, including crushing, malaxation, extraction and filtering, and storage [1]. Maximizing the concentrations of antioxidant components will ensure an oil with higher stability. As the ripening index (RI) of the olives increases, their phenolic content decreases, resulting in oils with lower oxidative stability [4,7\u20139]; likewise, chlorophylls and carotenoids decrease drastically, while the PUFA levels increase [4,8,9]. Furthermore, the storage of olives before oil production increases hydrolytic and oxidative degradation, leading to a depletion in the content of phenolic compounds, tocopherols, and carotenoids, therefore impairing the oil stability, especially when storage is prolonged [10]. In a previous pilot study using an ABENCOR system (Abengoa S.A., Seville, Spain), the effect of the RI and malaxation conditions on the phenolic content of \u2018Corbella\u2019 EVOOs was evaluated [7]. Additionally, a targeted metabolic profiling of this ancient olive cultivar was conducted to determine the composition of olives at an early maturation stage [11]. As a continuation of this research, with the aim of understanding and improving oil stability and shelf life, the present study analyzed \u2018Corbella\u2019 EVOOs produced in an industrial mill under different malaxation conditions using olives of a similar RI (1 to 1.5). The effect of storing the olives overnight for 17 h at ambient temperature on the EVOO composition and oxidative stability was also evaluated. This is the first time that \u2018Corbella\u2019 EVOOs produced in an industrial mill are analyzed to determine the effect of olive storage and malaxation conditions. The study of olive oils produced in industrial mills is always more accurate than studying oils obtained at laboratory scale. Furthermore, as \u2018Corbella\u2019 is an ancient cultivar recently reintroduced, more information is needed to understand its oxidative stability, information that can also be useful in understanding other cultivars."

More information about the orchard and the environmental and agronomical conditions are detailed elsewhere [11]. Before the oil production, the olives were washed with water. The olives were crushed using a 5 mm sieve, and the water addition was 10 L/h. The EVOOs were produced in an industrial mill (OLIOMIO 200 PROFY, MORI-TEM) by the company MIGJORN (Valls de Torroella, Catalonia, Spain) on two consecutive days, 13 and 14 October 2021, and kindly provided to our research group by the same company. The tested variables were temperature (18 and 23 \u25e6C) and time (30, 40 and 50 min) of malaxation. Six different EVOOs were produced with the same olive sample on the two days. O1, O2 and O3 were produced on 13 October and O4, O5, and O6 were produced the following day. The olives used for the elaboration of O4\u2013O6 were stored in a tractor trailer at ambient temperature (from 14 to 21 \u25e6C) for 17 h overnight. To check whether olive storage could have altered the results, O4 was produced using the same malaxation conditions as O1. The EVOO samples were stored at \u221220 \u25e6C until the chemical analyses."

A total of 25 mg of oil was weighed in a 10 mL tube and 40 \u00b5L of the internal standard (methyl tridecanoate, C13) was added at 1000 mg/L. Firstly, after the addition of 2 mL of 0.5 N sodium methoxide, the solution was stirred for 30 s and immediately heated at 100 \u25e6C for 15 min. The samples were then cooled in an ice bath. Secondly, 2 mL of 14% boron trifluoride was added to the samples, and the solution was again stirred for 30 s and heated at 100 \u25e6C for 15 min, before cooling in an ice bath. Thirdly, 1 mL of hexane was added to the samples, and the solution was stirred for 1 min. After the incorporation of 2 mL of saturated NaCl, the samples were stirred again for 30 s. Finally, the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 7 min, and 250 \u00b5L of the hexane phase was collected with a micropipette and stored in vials at \u221220 \u25e6C until analyzed. Fast GC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu GC-2010 Gas Chromatograph (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a Shimadzu AOC-20i Autoinjector.

Trolox was used as the standard to prepare a calibration curve for DPPH (linearity range: 5\u2013100 \u00b5g/mL, R2 > 0.927). The oxidative stability was evaluated with the Rancimat method [14]. This technique measures the oxidative stability of oils and fats in accelerated conditions and is based on the induction of sample oxidation by exposure to high temperatures and air flow. Therefore, the longer the induction time, the more stable the sample. A mass of 3 g of EVOO sample was heated at 120 \u25e6C with a constant air flow of 20 L/h. The results were expressed as the induction time of oxidation (in hours), measured with the Rancimat 743 apparatus (Metrohm Co., Basilea, Switzerland).

Results are expressed as\nmean \u00b1 standard deviation, n = 9. All variables differed significantly (p < 0.05) between samples.\nThe sum of phenolic compounds was not significantly affected by extracting the oil a day after the olive harvest, even though it was slightly higher in O4 (Table 1). However, most of the individual phenolic compounds decreased significantly, most likely due to the action of oxidative enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POX). When olives are damaged, the oxygen required for the oxidoreductase reactions can enter the fruit, which also favors the proliferation of microorganisms such as yeasts and bacteria, another possible factor contributing to the phenolic loss [15]. In contrast, secoiridoid levels increased, particularly oleuropein aglycone, oleacein, and oleocanthal (Figure 1). This behavior can be attributed to the action of hydrolytic enzymes such as \u03b2-glucosidase and esterases during the 17 h of storage. Another relevant factor is that plant synthesis of phenolic compounds is activated as a defense response to repair damage [16]. For example, oleuropein aglycone has been associated with a response to wounding stress in olives [17]. The decrease in \u03b1-tocopherol and squalene could also be due to oxidative reactions [18]. In addition, the activity of enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis could contribute to the depletion of squalene [19].\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1776 7 of 17\n* Elenolic acid was not included in the total phenolic content, as it is not a phenolic compound, but a degradation product.\nOlive storage affected the content of carotenoids, which increased, whereas chlorophyll levels decreased, even though it was not statistically different. Chlorophyll is susceptible to photooxidation, but this process was limited as the 17 h of storage was mainly at night, which could also explain why carotenoids, strong protectors against photosensitized oxidation [5], were not depleted. Additionally, \u03b1-tocopherol can contribute to the protective effect of carotenoids, avoiding their loss [20]. The increase in carotenoids in the EVOO could be attributed to the degradation of chloroplast membranes during olive storage, which enhances extractability during malaxation [21]. Finally, while olive storage did not alter the total FA content, some individual Fas were affected (Table S1). C15:0, C15:1, and linoleic (C18:2 n-6) acids increased, whereas C20:2 n-6, C22:0, C22:1 n-9, C22:2 n-6, C23:0, and C24:0 decreased. Therefore, the very-long-chain Fas (more than 18C) seem to have been damaged by olive storage. Possible explanations could be related to the inactivation of the elongases involved in their biosynthesis [22], or to FA degradation over time. The activity of specific desaturases has been associated with an increase of linoleic acid [23], which in the present study resulted in a significant reduction of the oleic/linoleic and MUFA/PUFA ratios (Figure 1), an indicator that the oil has lost oxidative stability.\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1776 8 of 17\nHowever, despite having a lower oleic/linoleic ratio and a reduced concentration of \u03b1-tocopherol and squalene, O4 had significantly higher DPPH and Rancimat values (Table 1, Figure 1). These findings reflect that phenolic compounds, especially the secoiridoids oleacein, oleocanthal, and oleuropein aglycone, contributed strongly to both the antioxidant capacity and oxidative stability of the oil. The high antioxidant capacity of secoiridoids, especially o-diphenols, has been reported previously [4,24]. In other olive cultivars, Rancimat values have been found to remain unaltered over several days of storage [15]. In the case of \u2018Corbella\u2019 olives, our results show that storing healthy fruit with an RI of 1 to 1.5 for 17 h overnight before EVOO production enhances the oxidative stability of the oil.\n3.3. Effect of Malaxation Conditions on the EVOO Composition and Oxidative Stability 3.3.1. Phenolic Compounds\nMalaxation conditions had variable effects on the different phenolic compounds (Table 1). Although the sum of phenolic compounds was not altered by malaxation, phenolic alcohols and flavonoids were negatively affected by the higher temperature (p < 0.05) and showed no significant effects due to malaxation time. The higher temperature also negatively affected the secoiridoids, as previously reported [7,12,25,26], but their content increased with malaxation time. Among the secoiridoids, which are the major group of phenolic compounds in olive oil, oleuropein aglycone is predominant in \u2018Corbella\u2019 olives and EVOOs [7,11]. The effect of the duration of malaxation on secoiridoids differed with the temperature. At 18 \u25e6C the levels of oleuropein aglycone increased slightly with time, whereas at 23 \u25e6C they decreased slightly. Similar tendencies were observed for ligstroside aglycone but without significant differences. Both oleocanthal and oleacein increased with time and temperature, as found in the pilot study [7]. Finally, hydroxyelenolic acid, oleocanthalic acid, and hydroxyoleuropein aglycone, which are oxidized derivatives of secoiridoids [27,28], showed significant differences only in O1 malaxed at 18 \u25e6C for 30 min, when their concentration was highest. Although elenolic acid is not a phenolic compound, it forms part of the chemical structure of secoiridoids [29] and is generated by their degradation [30]. An increase in both temperature and time of malaxation had a negative effect on the EVOO elenolic acid content, as previously reported [7]. \u2018Corbella\u2019 olives are characterized by a high content of this compound [11]. The high concentration of oleuropein aglycone and elenolic acid in \u2018Corbella\u2019 olives suggests this cultivar has a high \u03b2-glucosidase activity [30]. Although oleacein and oleocanthal increased with malaxation temperature, presumably due to esterase activity [31], their levels remained low. This indicated that the tested conditions were not optimal for the activity of these enzymes, which is reported to be enhanced at 30 \u25e6C [7,31]. Likewise, longer malaxation times significantly increased oleacein and oleocanthal content, as the esterases had more time to develop their activity. Additionally, the difference in oleacein and oleocanthal levels corresponded to the concentration of their precursors, the considerably higher concentration of oleuropein aglycone compared to ligstroside aglycone explaining the higher formation of oleacein versus oleocanthal. The fact that the levels of both aglycones were similar or differed only slightly in the EVOO samples suggests their catabolic and anabolic pathways were balanced. Thus, as well as being transformed by esterases to oleacein and oleocanthal, the aglycones could have been formed from oleuropein and ligstroside by \u03b2-glucosidase activity [30]. Three products of secoiridoid oxidation were found, hydroxyelenolic acid, oleocanthalic acid, and hydroxyoleuropein aglycone. Their low and generally constant concentration in all the EVOO samples indicates this oxidation process was not very active. The content of hydroxyelenolic acid was highest and that of oleocanthalic acid lowest, which corresponds with the levels of their respective precursors, elenolic acid and oleocanthal. Two phenomena can contribute to the depletion of phenolic compounds during malaxation: the activity of oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes [32], and the transfer of hydrophilic phenols to the water phase [33]. Both phenomena increase with longer malaxation times.\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1776 9 of 17\nAccording to our results, as the oxidative products did not increase with malaxation time, it seems more likely that the depletion of elenolic acid could be attributed to its transfer to the water phase. This is supported by the observation that hydroxytyrosol, also a degradation product of secoiridoids, did not increase with malaxation temperature or time. Additionally, hydroxytyrosol levels were only significantly lower at 23 \u25e6C and 40 min, suggesting that its degradation or transfer to the water phase can occur in these malaxation conditions. The flavonoids apigenin and luteolin were negatively affected by increasing the temperature of malaxation, as reported in other studies [7], whereas a longer malaxation time reduced their content only at 18 \u25e6C. The same behavior was observed for hydroxytyrosol acetate and the lignan pinoresinol, which were depleted when the malaxation time was increased at 18 \u25e6C. Finally, the levels of p-coumaric acid decreased when both malaxation parameters were increased, indicating a susceptibility to degradation or transfer to the water phase. According to these results, malaxation at 18 \u25e6C for 30 min provides the most favorable conditions to obtain \u2018Corbella\u2019 EVOO with high concentrations of phenolic compounds. However, if the goal is also to obtain EVOOs with a high content of oleocanthal and oleacein, malaxation should be applied at 18 \u25e6C for 50 min, as their concentration is enhanced by higher temperatures or longer times.\n3.3.2. Fatty Acid Profile\nThe FA profile was the same in all EVOO samples, regardless of the malaxation conditions applied (Table S2). The main FA was oleic acid (C18:1 n-9) (77.75\u201378.89%), followed by palmitic acid (C16:0) (11.68\u201311.86%), linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6) (5.44\u20136.69), stearic acid (C18:0) (1.78\u20131.90%), 9-palmitoleic acid (C16:1 n-7) (0.59\u20130.64), \u03b1-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3) (0.52\u20130.57%), arachidic acid (C20:0) (0.28\u20130.29%), gondoic acid (C20:1 n-9) (0.20\u20130.22%), and behenic acid (C22:0) (0.08\u20130.10%). The percentage of the other Fas was <0.10%. The FA composition (%) of the samples (Table S2) fell within the limits established for EVOO by the European Commission No 2022/2104 [34] and coincides with the FA profile previously reported for \u2018Corbella\u2019 olives [11]. \u2018Corbella\u2019 EVOO has a higher proportion of oleic acid, and less palmitic, linoleic, 9-palmitoleic, arachidic, and gondoic acids than \u2018Arbequina\u2019 EVOO [13], and more palmitic and less oleic, stearic, linoleic, \u03b1-linolenic, and arachidic acids than \u2018Picual\u2019 EVOO [35]. Variations in the FA composition of olive oils of different cultivars are due to genetic differences [2], such as the variable capacity or expression of desaturase enzymes involved in FA biosynthesis [23]. The total FA content was not significantly affected by any of the factors studied, with values ranging between 817.80 mg/g and 866.36 mg/g in all the EVOO samples (Table S1), although it tended to increase with the malaxation temperature. At higher temperatures, viscosity is reduced, and coalescence of oil droplets is enhanced, so the oily phase becomes richer in oil and poorer in other compounds, especially unsaponifiable lipids and water [13]. The most abundant Fas, oleic and palmitic acids, did not show any significant differences between samples. Nevertheless, the concentration of relevant Fas such as palmitoleic, linoleic, \u03b1-linolenic, and gondoic acids increased at the higher temperature, as reported in \u2018Arbequina\u2019 EVOOs [13]. Linoleic acid was affected by an interaction of both malaxation parameters. At 18 \u25e6C, its concentration tended to increase with malaxation time, whereas at 23 \u25e6C it tended to decrease, suggesting that prolonging the malaxation at high temperatures promoted its oxidation or lipoxygenase activity [36]. Increasing both malaxation parameters reduced the MUFA/PUFA and oleic/linoleic ratios, indicating that higher temperatures and longer times of malaxation produce EVOOs more susceptible to oxidation processes. Accordingly, the most stable EVOO was produced by malaxation at 18 \u25e6C for 30 min (MUFA/PUFA = 13.21 \u00b1 0.17, oleic/linoleic = 14.50 \u00b1 0.20), followed by 18 \u25e6C for 40 min (MUFA/PUFA = 12.79\u00b1 0.05, oleic/linoleic = 13.93\u00b1 0.05) (Table S1). A previous analysis of \u2018Corbella\u2019 olives with an RI similar to that of the olives used in the present study found lower values for the two ratios [11] compared to the \u2018Corbella\u2019\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1776 10 of 17\nEVOOs, indicating the oxidative stability was enhanced during the production process. Hern\u00e1ndez et al. [2] compiled a list of the oleic/linoleic ratios of olive oils produced from 89 cultivars from the Worldwide Olive Germplasm Bank of Cordoba. According to these values, \u2018Corbella\u2019 EVOOs would be ranked between 10th and 15th. However, the ratios of that study were obtained from EVOOs produced with olives harvested 28\u201331 weeks after flowering, i.e., with an RI above 2. An \u2018Arbequina\u2019 EVOO produced from olives with an RI between 1.16 and 2.26 and using different malaxation conditions [13] had an oleic/linoleic ratio between 6.21 and 7.82, which is considerably lower than the ratio of \u2018Corbella\u2019 EVOOs (11.62\u201314.50). The \u2018Arbequina\u2019 ratio reported by Hern\u00e1ndez et al. [2] was even lower (4.17). Linoleic acid is generated by the desaturation of oleic acid, and in some olive cultivars, such as \u2018Picual\u2019, \u2018Arbequina\u2019, and \u2018Picudo\u2019, the content of this PUFA increases with maturation due to a high expression of desaturase genes [23], resulting in a decrease in the oleic/linoleic ratio. However, in \u2018Corbella\u2019 olives the ratio was found to increase with ripeness up to an RI of 2 [11], suggesting this cultivar has a different expression pattern of the desaturases involved in the biosynthesis of both FA. Considering these results, it is likely that \u2018Corbella\u2019 EVOOs produced from olives with an RI of 2 would have a higher oleic/linoleic ratio, and would therefore be more stable than cultivars with a higher linoleic acid content, such as \u2018Arbequina\u2019. As mentioned, the oleic/linoleic ratio differs between \u2018Corbella\u2019 and \u2018Arbequina\u2019 EVOOs because the former has a higher proportion of oleic acid and lower proportion of linoleic acid. Accordingly, \u2018Corbella\u2019 olives seem to be a suitable choice for the production of EVOOs with high oleic/linoleic ratios. However, before reaching a definitive conclusion, the evolution of the ratio should be tracked over the whole maturation process of \u2018Corbella\u2019 olives.\n3.3.3. Carotenoids, Chlorophylls, \u03b1-Tocopherol, and Squalene\nAll the pigments (lutein, \u03b2-carotene, and chlorophylls) increased with longer malaxation (Table 1), because, as previously reported, there was more time for their transfer to the oily phase [12,37]. However, chlorophylls decreased at the higher temperature. Pigments are susceptible to degradation when exposed to temperature and oxygen X [5,38\u201340]. Therefore, the balance between the transfer and the degradation determines the final pigment content in the oil. Furthermore, it was previously reported that the loss caused by the oil extraction process is more marked for the chlorophylls than for the carotenoids [41,42], suggesting that chlorophylls could be more susceptible to degradation than carotenoids. A-Tocopherol and squalene were negatively affected by the higher malaxation temperature and times; a decrease in levels due to a higher temperature has been reported in other studies [12,43]. Tocopherols are strong antioxidants that protect olive oil from lipid oxidation [1], so an oxidation process during malaxation could have caused their depletion in our study. Squalene also has a protective effect, helping to prevent the temperature-dependent autoxidation of PUFAs [44]. Additionally, as an unsaturated molecule, squalene is unstable and easily oxidized, which could also explain the depletion observed [19]. As previously discussed, the PUFA content increased slightly with the malaxation temperature. Rastrelli et al. [18] found that PUFA levels remained constant during 8 months of EVOO storage, and only started to decline when antioxidant levels had decreased considerably. Therefore, the decrease in \u03b1-tocopherol and squalene in the EVOO samples could be related to their contribution to protecting PUFAs from thermal oxidation.\n3.3.4. Oxidative Stability (Rancimat) and Antioxidant Capacity (DPPH Assay) of the EVOO Samples\nIncreasing the temperature without changing the malaxation time led to a slight increase in the oxidative stability of the EVOO samples (Table 1). The same pattern was observed when the malaxation time was extended without altering the temperature. The EVOO with the highest oxidative stability was produced by malaxation at 18 \u25e6C for 50 min. When the temperature was increased without changing the malaxation time, the DPPH assay revealed that the resulting EVOOs had a higher antioxidant capacity (Table 1). In\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1776 11 of 17\ncorrelation with the results for optimum oxidative stability, the best values were obtained with conditions of 18 \u25e6C/50 min. The increase in antioxidant activity correlates with the higher levels of the strongly antioxidant phenolics hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein aglycone, oleocanthal and oleacein, as well as the carotenoids lutein and \u03b2-carotene. A high contribution of phenolic compounds, especially o-diphenols, together with carotenoids, to the oxidative stability measured by Rancimat has been previously reported [1,45]. Thus, in agreement with the results obtained when analyzing the effect of olive storage, the highest antioxidant capacity and oxidative stability were observed in EVOOs with the highest content of phenolic compounds, especially oleacein, oleocanthal, and oleuropein aglycone."

Two plots are basic to understand the PCA, the score plot and the loading plot, which show the relationships among the samples and variables, respectively. Thus, the closer the samples or variables, the more related. In the score plot (Figure 2), O1 (18 \u25e6C, 30 min) is clearly separated from the other samples and located on the left side, showing that the composition of O1 samples greatly differs from the others. O2 (18 \u25e6C, 40 min) is clustered in the middle of the plot, but closer to the remaining samples, also indicating a difference in composition but not as great as O1. Finally, the other samples (O3, O4, O5 and O6) are on the right side of the plot, and their proximity indicates a more similar composition. Although all three factors evaluated (malaxation temperature and time, and olive storage) seem to contribute to the separation of the samples (Figure 3A\u2013C), olive storage appears to be the most influential, as samples produced on the day of harvesting are distributed on the left side, appearing on the right side when produced the following day (Figure 3A). O3 samples are an exception, as they appear on the right side of the plot, despite being produced on the day of harvesting, indicating that the malaxation conditions (18 \u25e6C, 50 min) resulted in EVOOs with a similar composition to those produced with stored olives. Nevertheless, O3 samples are positioned toward the upper right of the plot, similar to O4, while O5 and O6 are more in the bottom right, indicating that the malaxation conditions still have an influence on the separation.\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 17\nthe following day (Figure 3A).

O2 samples are associated with the same variables as O1, but to a lesser extent, because the separation between samples and variables is greater in this case. Additionally, the loading plot gives information about the relationships among the variables. The proximity of Rancimat values to secoiridoids, particularly oleacein and oleocanthal, corroborates the strong positive correlation between these variables. DPPH values and oleuropein aglycone are also situa ed quite closely to these v riables, as are lutein and \u03b2-carotene, indicating a positive correlation. These positive correlations demonstrate the contribution of th se compounds to the oil oxidative stability: the closer to Rancimat, the greater the contribution. Therefore, secoiridoids, especially oleacein and oleocanthal, are the major contributors. Benito et al.

            "text": "This study of \u2018Corbella\u2019 EVOO, which was aimed at improving its oxidative stability, revealed two significant conclusions. First, linoleic acid was favored by olive storage and a higher malaxation temperature. Consequently, the oleic/linoleic ratio was higher at the lower malaxation temperature and time (18 \u25e6C and 30 min), and when the oil was produced on the same day of olive harvest. Accordingly, the \u2018Corbella\u2019 cultivar seems to be a promising candidate for the production of EVOOs with a high oleic/linoleic ratio. Second, although producing the EVOOs on the day of the olive harvest with malaxation at 18 \u25e6C for 30 min resulted in a better composition in terms of \u03b1-tocopherol, squalene, and oleic/linoleic ratio, these conditions did not produce the best values of antioxidant activity and oxidative stability. In fact, the EVOOs with the optimum antioxidant capacity and oxidative stability were obtained by malaxating at the higher temperature and times, and after storing the olives overnight. These desirable attributes were positively correlated with the content of secoiridoids, especially oleacein and oleocanthal. A synergistic effect between these two secoiridoids and carotenoids should not be discarded. The results of this study therefore indicate that secoiridoids contribute strongly to the antioxidant capacity and oxidative stability of \u2018Corbella\u2019 EVOOs, and that oils with a high content of oleacein and oleocanthal will be more stable and have a longer shelf life. According to this study, storing the olives at environmental temperature overnight and performing the malaxation at least at 23 \u25e6C for 40\u201350 min (depending on the temperature), will increase the oleacein and oleocanthal content and thus the oxidative stability of EVOOs. These findings signify a notable advancement and hold substantial utility and significance in addressing and enhancing EVOO stability. Future research should be focused on how the content of oleacein and oleocanthal can be even more enhanced by studying the factors involved in their accumulation, such as agronomic and climatic conditions, fruit ripeness, and technological aspects of oil extraction. Furthermore, an evaluation of EVOO quality and stability during long storage, as well as interventional studies would be of great relevance to see the impact of these two secoiridoids on EVOO shelf life and human health.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antiox12091776/s1, Table S1: Concentration of fatty acids (mg/g); Table S2: Fatty acid composition (%).\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.O.-C., A.N., A.R.-A. and R.M.L.-R.; methodology, A.O.-C., A.N., A.R.-A., A.V.-Q. and R.M.L.-R.; formal analysis, A.O.-C.; investigation, A.O.-C., A.L.-Y., M.M.A., A.N. and A.R.-A.; resources, A.O.-C., A.N., A.R.-A. and R.M.L.-R.; data curation, A.O.-C., A.N. and A.R.-A.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.O.-C.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.O.-C., M.P., A.L.-Y., A.N., A.R.-A., A.V.-Q. and R.M.L.-R.; visualization, A.O.-C.; supervision, M.P. and R.M.L.-R.; project administration, R.M.L.-R.; funding acquisition, R.M.L.-R.
