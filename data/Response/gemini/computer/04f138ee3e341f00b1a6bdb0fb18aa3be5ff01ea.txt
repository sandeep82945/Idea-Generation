1. **Investigate the use of AI and machine learning to optimize the viewport-dependent streaming process.** This could involve developing algorithms that can predict user viewing patterns and adjust the streaming parameters accordingly, or using AI to develop more efficient bitstream packing and rewriting methods.


2. **Explore the use of other video coding standards, such as VVC, for viewport-dependent streaming.** VVC is the latest video coding standard from the ITU-T and ISO/IEC, and it offers a number of features that could be beneficial for viewport-dependent streaming, such as improved compression efficiency and support for higher resolutions.


3. **Develop new methods for packing and transporting non-adjacent regions of a viewport.** This could involve developing new tiling algorithms or using existing tiling algorithms in a more efficient way.


4. **Investigate the use of viewport-dependent streaming for other types of immersive media, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).** Viewport-dependent streaming could be used to reduce the bandwidth requirements for AR and VR applications, making them more accessible to a wider range of users.


5. **Conduct user studies to evaluate the impact of viewport-dependent streaming on user experience.** This could involve measuring factors such as latency, quality, and overall satisfaction.
