While zinc is known to mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress, how the dietary supplementation of different sources and levels of it can improve the heat stress capacity of Chinese landraces remains unclear. This study investigated Xueshan chickens, which are an important local breed in China. The effects of different levels of ZnS and Zn-Prot M on their intestinal immune function under heat stress were compared. We found that different levels of ZnS and Zn-Prot M could effectively reduce the secretion level of IL-6 in the serum, and 60 mg/kg was optimal. Compared with ZnS, Zn-Prot M significantly increased duodenal villus height and VH/CD ratio, thus Zn-Prot M was more effective than ZnS. Both ZnS and Zn-Prot M significantly down-regulated TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and MyD88 in 102-day-old duodenum, and IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and NFKBIA in jejunum and ileum at 74, 88, and 102 days old, with 60 mg/kg Zn-Prot M determined as optimal. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Zn-Prot M is superior to ZnS in improving intestinal immunity in Xueshan chickens, and 60 mg/kg is the optimal addition dose.",

Heat stress can cause physio-\nAnimals 2023, 13, 3025. https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13193025 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/animals\nAnimals 2023, 13, 3025 2 of 14\nlogical disorders and immune system damage and may even lead to death, thus causing huge economic losses to the poultry industry [2]. Broilers are more susceptible to heat stress because of their characteristics of high body temperature, sweat gland deficiency, and exuberant metabolism [3,4]. The intestine is not only an essential digestive organ but also a central part of the immune system that forms a congenital barrier against food antigens, pathogenic microorganisms, and other damages [5]. Heat stress can trigger intestinal mucosal damage, disrupt intestinal tight junctions and microvillous structures, and trigger inflammatory responses and enterogenic infections in poultry [6\u20139]. Under the existing broiler breeds and feeding and management conditions, compared with the non-nutritional strategies used to alleviate heat stress and reduce losses, the application of anti-heat stress additives is an effective nutritional management strategy to eliminate or alleviate heat stress, and commonly used anti-heat stress agents include trace elements, vitamins, electrolytes, and organic acids [10]. As a trace element involved in the production of metallothionein, zinc (Zn) plays an important role in a variety of biochemical processes. For instance, it is a catalytic cofactor of more than 300 enzymes and a structural component of hundreds of zinc finger protein transcription factors, playing a key role in enhancing immunity, growth, reproductive performance, and disease resistance [11,12]. Because there is insufficient Zn in natural feed ingredients, appropriate amounts of Zn are commonly added to poultry diets. The most commonly used Zn supplements in poultry feed are Zn sulfate (ZnS) and Zn oxide, which are of inorganic origin. In recent years, organic Zn sources for feed supplementation have become popular in livestock and poultry production [13]. The addition of Zn in poultry feed has a positive effect on the growth and immunity of broilers. Zn can enhance the physiological response, growth performance, and immune response of broilers, including promoting the proliferation and activity of immune cells (such as macrophages and lymphocytes), enhancing antioxidant capacity, and promoting the synthesis and secretion of antibodies [14,15]. In addition, Zn has been shown to positively modulate the intestinal microarchitecture in broilers raised at high ambient temperatures [16]. Adding Zn to the diet can improve the damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier function caused by Salmonella infection in broiler chickens [17]. Despite the fact that that Zn has been shown to reduce the adverse effects of heat stress on broilers, it is unclear whether the dietary addition of Zn, particularly Zn proteinate with moderate chelation strength (Zn-Prot M) and moderate chelating strength, can improve the heat stress capacity in the broilers of Chinese landraces. Xueshan chickens are a new variety in China developed by crossbreeding high-quality local Tibetan chickens and Chahua chickens [18]. Their commercial importance is increasing due to their unique flavor and the texture of the meat. In this study, we investigated the effects of different sources and levels of Zn on intestinal immune function in Xueshan chickens under heat stress. We analyzed the secretion levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in serum via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, examined the effects of different zinc sources and levels on intestinal morphology via histopathology, and analyzed the mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, MyD88, and NFKBIA genes in small intestinal tissues after zinc addition via a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Overall, these results reveal the effects of different zinc sources and levels on intestinal immune function and protection in Xueshan chickens under heat stress."

            "text": "The role that the trace element Zn plays in animal health has been demonstrated, but this substance cannot be stored in the body and therefore requires a regular intake of Zn to meet the functional requirements [22,23]. The small intestine is an important organ for absorbing nutrients, and the height of the small intestinal villi and crypt depth are important indicators to measure the absorption capacity of the small intestine. The villus height was positively correlated with the number of epithelial cells. When the villus height increased, the number of epithelial cells and the ability to absorb nutrients increased. Crypt depth can reflect the maturity and proliferation rate of epithelial cells and crypt shallowing, as well as enhance cell maturity and absorption nutrient capacity. The ratio of VH/CD can comprehensively reflect the absorption capacity of the small intestine; the absorption capacity ratio is enhanced [24,25]. It has been shown that heat stress adversely impacts intestinal health by modulating intestinal morphology, increasing crypt depth, and decreasing villus height and VH/CD ratio [26]. Zn supplementation can enhance intestinal immune function, improve intestinal mucosal barrier function, and improve anti-inflammatory capacity [27,28], which is important for intestinal health and immune protection in animals under heat stress. Tako et al. showed that Zn can promote cell division, proliferation, and protein synthesis and also improve small intestinal morphology [29]. Ma et al. showed that feeding broilers a diet containing 90 mg/kg Zn glycine significantly increased duodenal villus height and decreased crypt depth [30]. In this study, Xueshan chicken, a specific local chicken breed, was selected as the experimental object to investigate the effect of different levels of Zn in the diet on the intestinal tract of these chickens under heat stress. Our findings showed villus growth and crypt shallowing following Zn addition under heat stress, suggesting that Zn may contribute to attenuating heat-stress-induced intestinal injury. Compared with ZnS, Zn-Prot M could increase the height of small intestinal villi and enhance the ratio of VH/CD, indicating that Zn-Prot M was slightly more effective than ZnS in its effect on small intestinal morphology, but the difference between Zn-Prot M and ZnS was not significant in the test, which may be because the addition level of Zn was the same in each group, while the height crypt depth of small intestinal villi in broilers during the test period was relatively short in response to the difference between Zn sources, so the improvement effect on small intestinal morphology could not be fully reflected. Under heat stress conditions, the expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, NFKBIA, and MyD88 in the intestine of Xueshan chickens can be assessed through qPCR to provide an evaluation of intestinal immune characteristics [31\u201335]. These genes are important molecules closely related to immune response and inflammation regulation. IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 are pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the regulation and transmission of inflammatory responses and various cellular activities. An overexpression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 is closely associated with the occurrence and development of inflammatory diseases [36]. Therefore, the observation of the decreased expression levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 after organic Zn supplementation may suggest that organic Zn may have an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory response. Organic Zn may regulate the relevant signaling pathways to inhibit the production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 or decrease their expression levels, thus alleviating the inflammatory response and immune abnormalities. NFKBIA is an inhibitory protein of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), which plays an important role in regulating the inflammatory signaling pathway. NF-\u03baB is a key transcription factor involved in the regulation of inflammatory gene expression [37], and a decrease in NFKBIA expression level is often associated with an activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Therefore, the observation of the decreased expression level of NFKBIA after organic Zn supplementation may indicate that organic Zn may regulate the inflammatory response by inhibiting the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. These experimental results suggest that adding organic Zn under heat stress conditions can reduce the expression levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and NFKBIA, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response and immune abnormalities. This\nAnimals 2023, 13, 3025 12 of 14\nhelps maintain the health of the intestine, protect the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier, and improve the animal\u2019s heat stress adaptability. While this study focused on Xueshan chickens, which are a Chinese breed, further research on the mechanism of Zn in intestinal immune regulation has valuable implications for other chicken breeds as well. Different chicken breeds may have differences in their physiological characteristics and immune requirements, so further studies are needed to develop nutritional strategies tailored to their specific needs. Additionally, this study only observed changes in the expression levels of immune genes, and the specific impacts and regulatory mechanisms of Zn on intestinal immune mechanisms are still unclear. Further research is required to explore these mechanisms."
