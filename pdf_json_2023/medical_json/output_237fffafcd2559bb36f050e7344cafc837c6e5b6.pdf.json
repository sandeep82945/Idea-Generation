ABSTRACT Objective To assess the prevalence of teenage pregnancy and associated factors among teenage schoolgirls aged 15\u201319 years in Wolaita Sodo town, southern Ethiopia. Design Crosssectional survey. Setting This study was conducted among teenage girls from preparatory and high schools in Wolaita Sodo town, southern Ethiopia, between 1 April and 30 May 2019. Participants 588 (97.8%) of 601 randomly selected teenage schoolgirls aged 15\u201319 years (selected via a multistage random sampling technique) participated in the study. Outcome measures Teenage pregnancy and associated factors. Results The prevalence of teenage pregnancy among schoolgirls in Wolaita Sodo town was 14.6% (95% CI 11.9% to 17.7%). The current pregnancy rate was 33.7% (95% CI 23.9% to 44.7%). Having a family history of teenage pregnancy (AOR 3.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 8.4) and access to mass media (AOR 2.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 6.2) were positively associated with teenage pregnancy, while condom use (AOR 0.1; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.5) and knowledge of where to get modern contraceptives (AOR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 0.9) were negatively associated. Conclusions The prevalence of teenage pregnancy among schoolgirls in Wolaita Sodo was high. Having a family history of teenage pregnancy and access to mass media were positively associated with teenage pregnancy, whereas reported condom use and knowledge of where to get modern contraceptives were negatively associated with teenage pregnancy among schoolgirls.",

In many nations, unmarried adolescent mothers are likely to encounter social exclusion, which may result in rejection by their family and peers.5\u20137\nIn low- income and middle- income countries (LMICs), teenagers aged 15\u201319 years had an estimated 21 million pregnancies annually, of which about 50% were unintended and gave rise to approximately 12 million births. According to these data, 55% of unintended pregnancies among teenage girls result in abortions, which are usually unsafe in LMICs.8 The proportions of adolescent fertility rates ranged from 2% in China to more than 50% in sub- Saharan Africa.9 Sub- Saharan Africa had the highest rate of adolescent fertility in the world, with 101 births per 1000 in 2013.8 10 11 One of every three among the 14.3 million adolescent girls who gave birth in 2008 around the world\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 This study had a large sample size and a low nonresponse rate. \u21d2 Since the study is cross- sectional, it cannot investigate temporal relationships. \u21d2 Because behavioural variables are evaluated based on self- reports, social desirability bias may be an issue. \u21d2 Even though it is currently believed that all teenage girls in the study area attend school, there can be girls missing from school for socioeconomic reasons, so our study may lack representativeness at the community level.\nP atna).

It varies depending on the residence, with 5% in urban areas and 15% in rural areas. Moreover, disparities are seen across regions, with the highest at 23% in Afar and the lowest at 3% in Addis Ababa. Additionally, the proportion varies with age; it rose rapidly from 2% among women aged 15 years to 28% among those aged 19 years.17 Teenage pregnancy remains a significant public health and demographic challenge in the country.16 18\nVarious reports and publications have identified determinants of teenage pregnancy, such as not living with parents, low socioeconomic status, early sexual intercourse and a low level of contraception knowledge.18\u201321 In Ethiopia, there are limited data on the prevalence and factors associated with teenage pregnancy. Particularly in the study area, evidence of the prevalence and factors associated with teenage pregnancy is scarce. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing the prevalence of teenage pregnancy and associated factors among teenage schoolgirls aged 15\u201319 years in Wolaita, southern Ethiopia."

The sample size determined for this study was 601 and computed using the following assumptions: 95% confidence level, 80% power, one for a ratio of unexposed to exposed groups, 4.6% teenage pregnancy among teenagers who lived with their parents, and 11.5% teenage pregnancy among teenagers who lived with one of their parents, a design effect of two, and a 10% non- response rate.18\nSampling techniques and data collection procedures The study participants for this study were selected using a multistage random sampling technique. There were 16 schools (6 preparatory and 10 high schools) in the town. After stratifying the schools into preparatory and high schools, three preparatory schools and five high schools were selected using the lottery method. We prepared a separate sampling frame consisting of lists of 15\u201319 years old female students in alphabetical order in each school and grade level (9\u201312) with the support of the schools' administrations. The samples were distributed among the schools and grade levels based on samples proportional to their size. Finally, we selected the study participants from the prepared list using a computer- based random number generator (https://www.random.org/integers/).\nWe recruited six data collectors and two supervisors for data collection and supervision. We also provided training on the methods, objectives and other technical aspects of the study to the data collectors and supervisors for 3 days. The questionnaire prepared in English was translated into the local language (Amharic) and then re- translated into English for consistency (online supplemental file 1). Two different individuals who speak both English and Amharic fluently were used for the translation and re- translation. To ensure the quality of the data, pretesting of the questionnaire was conducted on 5% of the sample size among teenage girls selected from schools that were not included in our study. Inputs obtained from the pretest were used to improve the questionnaire and acquaint the data collectors with the data collection process. Finally, a pretested and self- administered questionnaire was used to collect the actual data from the study participants. During the data collection, every female student included in the study took a single seat with a sparse arrangement of chairs and desks. Then the questionnaires were distributed among the students after a short orientation. The principal investigator and the supervisors closely supervised the data collection process."

Regarding the sexual initiation of the first sex, 61 (41.2%) were peer- influenced. Of the total number of teenage students who had sex, 60 (40.5%) used modern contraceptives, of which 26 (43.3%) used emergency contraceptives. Regarding the exact timing of taking an emergency contraceptive, 17 (65.4%) started within 24 hours after having unprotected sex. Of the total teenage schoolgirls who participated in this study, only 174 (29.6%) knew where to get modern contraceptives (table 2)."

When asked about the pregnancy\u2019s status, 66 (76.7%) of the adolescent schoolgirls said it was unintended. Regarding the outcome of the pregnancy, 27 (31.4%) teenage schoolgirls carried out abortions (table 3).\nFactors associated with the teenage pregnancy Participants who had a family history of teenage pregnancy were positively associated with teenage pregnancy (AOR 3.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 8.4). Teenage pregnancy was 2.5 times higher among teenage schoolgirls who had frequent access to mass media (AOR 2.5; 95% CI 1.1 to 6.2). On the other hand, teenage schoolgirls who used condoms during sexual intercourse were negatively associated with teenage pregnancy (AOR 0.1; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.5) as compared to their counterparts. Similarly, teenage schoolgirls who knew where to get modern contraceptives were negatively related to teenage pregnancy (AOR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 0.9) (table 4)."

Out of the total number of teenage pregnancies among the schoolgirls reported\nin this study, 33.7% were currently pregnant. This is consistent with the finding reported from north- east Ethiopia.19 Regarding the condition of the pregnancy, 76.7% reported that the pregnancy was unintended. This is in line with the findings from the previous studies in Ethiopia.19 20 This might be partially explained by the sociodemographic condition of the population.\nP atna).

This is higher than the finding reported from another study in Ethiopia.20 This might be due to sociocultural variation between the populations. Regarding the sexual experience of teenage schoolgirls, a quarter (25.2%) of the participants had sexual experience, which is lower than the finding from the previous study in Ethiopia.19 The probable explanation for the difference might be the socioeconomic and cultural context of the study areas. In the present study, out of the total number of study participants who had sexual experience, 41.2% of the first sexual intercourse was initiated by peer influence. This is higher than the finding reported in western Kenya.29 The variation might be due to the difference in\nthe composition of the study population. This might indicate the importance of targeting peer groups for future intervention programmes in controlling teenage pregnancy among schoolgirls.\nOut of the total number of teenage students who had sexual experience, 40.5% used modern contraceptives. This is in agreement with the findings of previous studies in Ethiopia.19 20 This may indicate gender power disparities, which may impact the ability of teenage schoolgirls to refuse sex without contraceptive methods such as condoms or the knowledge gap about the importance of modern contraceptives. Similarly, among the teenage schoolgirls who used modern contraceptives, 43.3% used emergency contraceptives, which is also consistent with the finding from another study in Ethiopia.20 Regarding\nP atna).

This is in line with the result reported in another study from southern Ethiopia.20 The majority knew the exact time to take it; however, there was a significant proportion of the participants who didn't know when to take the emergency contraceptive. Knowing the exact time to take emergency contraceptives prevents unintended pregnancy. Therefore, it is essential to create awareness of the exact timing of taking emergency contraceptives and develop primary intervention strategies that target high- risk groups.\nIn the current study, a family history of teenage pregnancy, access to mass media, condom use, and knowledge of where to get modern contraceptives have shown a statistically significant association with teenage pregnancy. Having a family history of teenage pregnancy was positively associated with teenage pregnancy. The lifestyle and living environments within the families are probably the most likely to be contributing factors. Similarly, access to mass media was positively associated with teenage pregnancy among schoolgirls. This might be due to their listening to the radio or watching television with content that is not appropriate for their age. On the other hand, using a condom during sexual intercourse had a protective association with teenage pregnancy among schoolgirls. Other studies from Ethiopia and elsewhere in Africa reported similar findings.18 30 Likewise, knowledge of where to get modern contraceptives had a protective association with teenage pregnancy among schoolgirls. A similar finding was also reported in another study in Ethiopia.18 This might reinforce teenage schoolgirls' attitudes and behaviour positively towards the utilisation of modern contraceptives and then protect them from having an unintended pregnancy.\nOur study had some inevitable limitations. The study, being a cross- sectional survey, lacks temporal relationships. Even though currently all teenage girls in the study area are believed to attend school, there can be girls missing from school for socioeconomic reasons. For this reason, our study may lack representativeness at the community level. On the other hand, our study had strengths, such as a large sample size and high response rate."

            "text": "The prevalence of teenage pregnancy among schoolgirls in Wolaita Sodo town was high. A family history of teenage pregnancy and access to mass media were found to increase the odds of teenage pregnancy among schoolgirls in the study area, whereas condom use, and knowing where to get modern contraceptives were found to reduce the odds of teenage pregnancy among schoolgirls. We suggest that local and national governments, communitybased organisations, non- governmental organisations and the public promote the use of contraceptives during sex, such as condoms, to prevent unintended teen\npregnancies among teenage schoolgirls. We also recommend enhancing the provision of information on where to get contraceptives, as observed in the current study. We also suggest educating the public and teenage schoolgirls to avoid risk factors such as consuming media that promotes unsafe sex.\nTwitter Wakgari Binu Daga @nubonsa\nAcknowledgements The authors thank Wolaita Sodo University for support in both technical and ethical matters.
