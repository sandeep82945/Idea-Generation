    "abstractText": "The origin of life on Earth is an enigmatic and intricate conundrum that has yet to be comprehensively resolved despite recent significant developments within the discipline of archaeology and geology. Chemically, metal-sulfide minerals are speculated to serve as an important medium for giving birth in early life, while yet so far direct evidence to support the hypothesis for the highly efficient conversion of inorganic carbon into praxiological biomolecules remains scarce. In this work, we provide an initial indication that sphalerite, employed as a typical mineral, shows its enormous capability for promoting the conversion of inorganic carbon into elementary biomolecule formic acid (HCOOH) in airborne mineral-bearing aerosol microdroplet, which is over two orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding conventional bulk-like aqueous phase medium in the environment (e.g. river, lake, sea, etc.). This significant enhancement was further validated by a wide range of minerals and clays, including CuS, NiS, CoS, CdS, MnS, elemental sulfur, Arizona Test Dust, loess, nontronite, and montmorillonite. We reveal that the abundant interface of unique physical\u2013chemical features instinct for aerosol or cloud microdroplets reduces the reaction energy barrier for the reaction, thus leading to extremely high HCOOH production (2.52 \u00d7 10 kg year). This study unfolds unrecognized remarkable contributions of the considered scheme in the accumulation of prebiotic biomolecules in the ancient period of the Earth.",

Conversion of inorganic carbon to small HCOOH organic molecules is crucial as they are the basic building blocks for intricate compounds and primitive life. Here, we observed the extremely fast conversion process of inorganic carbon to organic one initiated by airborne microdroplets suspended with sphalerite mineral. More critically, the process can be a great contributor to the origin of life, leading to a previously unrecognized considerable production rate of HCOOH. This natural solar-driven inorganic carbon conversion emphasizes the important role of air\u2013water interface coupling of minerals in fostering prebiotic biomolecules in the primitive Earth\u2019s environment.\nCompeting Interest: The authors declare no competing interest.

            "text": "The origin of life remains an elusive and complex issue that has\nyet to be fully revealed. It is generally accepted that the conver-\nsion of inorganic carbon into simple organic molecules (formic\nacid, acetic acid, pyruvate, and amino acids) is a pivotal step, as\nit provides the fundamental building blocks for more complex bio-\nlogical compounds, which ultimately develop into primitive life forms (1\u20135). Among them, formic acid (HCOOH) receives great attention due to the priority of reduced carbon intermediate in route\nto methyl synthesis (6). However, the production of this basic or-\nganic molecule HCOOH through a conventional slow heteroge-\nneous catalytic process fails to explain the flourishing life origin\nby the time-consuming evolution of pieces of biomolecule blocks\n(days or weeks) within their short life span (several hours) when exposed to the rugged environment (4, 7, 8). Therefore, a fast formation pathway that goes beyond the known conventional reaction channel does exist, which is a critical step to unfold the unresolved life-origin mystery disputed for decades.\nOutstanding chemical reactivity at air\u2013water interfaces is alluring and receives tremendous interest across diverse disciplines (9\u201325). The hydrogen bond network at the air\u2013water interface is inevitably disrupted, and the contrasting chemical and physical properties of molecules present at the interface (such as hydrogen bonds, dipole moments, and acidity) extremely differ from those in the bulk, which can result in significantly faster reaction kinetics at the air\u2013water interface when compared with reactions occurring in bulk aqueous media. Recently, universal airborne\nic.oup.com /pnasnexus/article/2/11/pgad389/7420968 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nmicrodroplet particles (e.g. aerosol particles, cloud water, etc.), which possess abundant air\u2013water interfaces, have attracted tremendous attention for their great impact on altering the reaction efficiencies in a wide range of atmospheric relevant reactions (8, 16, 25\u201331). The atmospheric aerosol microdroplets have been proposed as prebiotic chemical reactors (8, 31), and some spontaneous reactions relevant to the probiotic chemistry in aqueous microdroplets\u2019 gas\u2013liquid interface have been documented. For instance, phosphorylation proceeds spontaneously within aqueous microdroplets containing a mixture of sugars and phosphoric acid (32), and the \u201cautomatic\u201d synthesis of uridine and other ribonucleotides (33), as well as the formation of peptide bonds during the condensation process of leucine ethyl ester are available in the presence of Cu2+ ions at the gas\u2013liquid interface (34). The above information highlights the nonmarginal role of a natural airborne \u201cmicrodroplet\u201d reaction chamber in prebiotic chemistry.\nOn the other hand, the catalog of the minerals in the earliest Hadean period was believed to mainly comprise 80 S-rich minerals (35), and recent archaeology studies also observed these oldest mineral deposits such as the mid-Paleozoic Yukon-Tanana terrane, the northern Canadian Cordillera (36), Chelopech Ore Field (Bulgaria) (37), and Palaeoproterozoic Kerry Road (38), suggesting that semiconducting sulfur-bearing minerals are ubiquitous in primitive Earth\u2019s environment (39). Alternative geology evidence in support of the origin of life that is linked to the crustal mineral lies in the low-eruptive volcanic caldera on continental land in Western Australia (about 3.48 billion years ago) where lasting voluminous hydrothermal fluid circulation activities were at play (40) and have been postulated as pivotal agents in the prebiotic processes across various natural circumstances. Excitingly, these minerals have been demonstrated to show outstanding capability in inorganic carbon photoreduction, thus leaving them considered as fundamental components in the prebiotic processes, often referred to as \u201cproto-enzymes\u201d orchestrating prebiotic organic syntheses. They have also played a pivotal role in sustaining the continuous chemical evolution, contributing to the functionality of intricate biochemical systems (41\u201345). In the primitive Earth\u2019s environment, minerals can be brought to the ground by volcanic eruptions, and some of them are carried into the air by wind currents (7, 46\u201348). Notably, the CO2 concentration level of the primordial atmosphere was perhaps 100\u20131,000 times higher than that in the current one, and early aqueous environments can consequently accumulate a considerable amount of (bi)carbonates anions, dominated in the form of HCO3\n\u2212 through dissolution equilibrium of atmospheric CO2 (49) in the acidic environment. Additionally, in the past tens to hundreds of millions of years, there have been infinitely many rounds of cycles (referring to the continuous production and sink processes of the airborne aerosol microdroplets that are derived from the aquatic environment enriched with bicarbonate ions through CO2 respiratory, e.g. ocean), with their average lifetime ranging from days to months (8). From this perspective, the emitted mineral dust particles that come from a series of geological activities (50\u201352) (e.g. volcanism, earthquakes, landslides, mineral weathering, etc.) can enter into atmospheric microdroplets, forming a natural microdroplet reactor full of these photoreactive mineral particles, where photocatalytic reduction of inorganic carbon to these organic building block molecules mediated by such \u201cnatural photocatalyst\u201d takes place (53).\nMotivated by the above important findings and information, the synergistic interplay between the excellent solar-driven organification trigged by metallic sulfide minerals and unique interfacial properties of airborne microdroplets is speculated to take\nplace, and a large quantity of HCOOH is thus expected to form in the natural aerosol full of suspended dust particles, which is far beyond preceding considered reaction medium that either belongs to the solid heterogeneous surface or pristine air\u2013water interface. This special microenvironment potentially serves as an important pathway for the transformation of inorganic carbon to organic carbon and consequently contributes to key organic moieties for the origin of life. Understanding such pathways and complicated environments that can facilitate the emergence of these primitive HCOOH organic molecules holds significant importance (42, 43, 54, 55). Yet, to our best knowledge, rare information is currently available for the prebiotic synthesis reactions catalyzed by the airborne minerals in the atmospheric microdroplet system, and to what extent their reactivity would be altered has not been reported.\nIn this study, we employed sphalerite as a typical sulfurbearing mineral to investigate its capacity for photoreduction of inorganic carbon (referring to the gas-phase CO2 and aqueousderived bicarbonate anion) to organic small molecules within airborne microdroplets and further evaluate the significant contribution of photochemical reduction of inorganic carbon by mineral-embedded microdroplet to the origin of life. The possible mechanism behind the extremely high HCOOH yield (approximately two orders of magnitude relative to the bulk) has been unfolded, and the photocatalytic reduction of inorganic carbon in microdroplets by other geologically rich metal sulfides has been investigated as well. This fast solar-driven natural inorganic carbon reduction reaction pathway in an airborne \u201cmicrodroplet\u201d reaction chamber suspended with minerals reveals the previously unrecognized route of significance that creates considerable prebiotic biomolecules for lives in the early Earth environment."

Prior to characterization and subsequent photoactivity measurement, the samples were pretreated using ball milling to mimic the natural polishing process of dust particles due to their geological activity. Subsequently, we carefully applied ultrasonic cleaning approach to remove undesired organic impurities to avoid complicated high-level backgrounds over the minerals (56). Powder X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1B) results indicate that the main components of the mineral were sphalerite-phase ZnS (PDF no. 5-0566) and quartz-phase SiO2 (PDF no. 46-1045). The mineral sample exhibited lattice fringes of 0.317 nm, corresponding to the (111) crystal plane of sphalerite-phase ZnS (57), as illustrated by bright-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and highangle annular dark field (HAADF) images (Fig. 1C). Elemental mapping analysis using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) demonstrated that Zn and S were homogeneously distributed throughout the mineral sample (Fig. 1C), thus enabling a good photocatalytic performance observed in artificial photocatalysts, as well evidenced by scanning electron microscopy analysis (Fig. S1). To further confirm the contribution of ZnS in the generation of basic organic molecules necessary for prebiotic biomolecules, we synthesized pure artificial ZnS using an early developed method (58) for good reference and comparison. The crystal phase of the synthesized ZnS is characterized as sphalerite-phase ZnS, with the main exposed crystal facet being (111), as indicated by XRD patterns and TEM images (Fig. S2).\n2 | PNAS Nexus, 2023, Vol. 2, No. 11 D\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /pnasnexus/article/2/11/pgad389/7420968 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024"

            "text": "Solid-state UV\u2013vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV\u2013Vis DRS) analysis reveals that the natural ZnS mineral is 3.35 eV (Fig. 2A), slightly narrower than that of the synthesized ZnS (3.49 eV), with the details of the analysis and experiments shown in the Materials and methods section. Mott\u2013Schottky measurement (Fig. 2B) confirms that natural and synthesized ZnS are featured in N-type semiconducting, with their flat-band potentials at \u22120.64 and \u22120.68 V (vs. Ag/AgCl; pH = 7), and conduct band minimums (CBMs) are accordingly determined to be at \u22120.64 and \u22120.68 eV, respectively, considering that the flat-band potential of N-type semiconducting is generally about 0.2 V more positive than its CBM (59, 60). We systematically investigated the band structure and density of states (DOSs) for ZnS by density-functional theory (DFT) calculation using local-density approximation (LDA) as exchange correlational functionals (61). Clearly, Fig. 2D and E reveals that ZnS is an N-type semiconducting with a direct band gap of 2.09 eV, in good agreement with the literature (62), but narrower than the experimental results probably because the calculated value within the density-functional LDA might be underestimated (63). The Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof, generalized gradient approximation total and partial electronic DOS indicated the density states at the CBM are mainly contributed by the S 3p-orbital, whereas those in the valence band maximum are mainly by the 3d-orbital of Zn (Fig. 2F and G). Overall, ZnS shows appropriate band edge positions in their electronic structures, which is essentially favorable for the catalytic inorganic carbon reduction (Fig. 2C). These electronic properties lead us to speculate ZnS as a natural semiconducting mineral that is at play in the origin of life (2).\nThe fast solar-driven transformation of inorganic carbon to HCOOH in microdroplets that go beyond the bulk Schematically, the microdroplet was produced utilizing a sprayer (Fig. 3A) on the superhydrophobic quartz glass substrate and then\ntransferred into a homemade reaction chamber. Gas of high relative humidity (\u223c90%) was introduced into the chamber for 10 min to stabilize the microdroplet before reaction, and ZnS was uniformly dispersed in the microdroplets even after 180 min, with the negligible change of the size, thus verifying the feasibility of solar-driven reaction in microdroplets (Figs. S3 and S4).\nThe HCOOH gradually builds up as the photoreduction reaction proceeds (Figs. 3B and S8). After 180 min, the HCOOH production in the microdroplet system reaches up to ca. 1,304 \u03bcmol g\u22121 (gaseous CO2) and 2,634 \u03bcmol g\u22121 (25 mM NaHCO3 solution), which is over two orders of magnitude higher than that of 7 \u03bcmol g\u22121 (gaseous CO2) and 20 \u03bcmol g\u22121 (25 mM NaHCO3 solution) in the corresponding bulk phase reaction. Control experiments reveal that in the absence of ZnS, UV-light, or C-source, the concentration of the products except HCOOH is negligible (Fig. S8), which is below the detection limit of gas chromatography (GC) and ion chromatography (IC) analyses, indicating that HCOOH is the main product that comes from the photoreduction reaction in the natural environment. More importantly, the cooperation mechanism between ZnS dust and air\u2013water interface for HCOOH production (>700 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121, Fig. S5) can be deduced for ZnS-bearing microdroplet system, which is extremely larger than HCOOH yields observed for the pristine ZnS mineral (\u223c10 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121) water microdroplet (not detected) and bulk ZnS suspension systems (\u223c10 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121). Additionally, in the microdroplet system, the HCOOH yield increases from 228 to 717 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121 when the CO2/Ar ratio increases from 25 to 100% (Fig. 3C). The production can be further increased to 2,382 \u03bcmol h\u22121 g\u22121 by increasing the initial concentration of inorganic carbon source, e.g. in the presence of 100 mM HCO3\n\u2212 (Fig. 3D). In the bulk phase reaction, the HCOOH yield was nearly two orders of magnitude lower than the microdroplet reaction under different reaction conditions, indicating that the microdroplet reaction system has superior photochemical reaction performance. These inorganic carbon conversion reactions are positively correlated with light intensity (64, 65), whereas the HCOOH yield in the microdroplet reaction\nFig. 1. Characterization of sphalerite.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) in the microdroplet system under 310 nm irradiation was calculated to be 3.04% (1.48 mW cm\u22122). To confirm the carbon source, we further conducted isotope light experiments using 13CO2 (3 h) through in situ Raman analysis (Fig. S9), the C=O stretching of 12COOH at 1,648 cm\u22121 was shifted to 1,635 cm\u22121, consistent with the Raman shift trend in early observation (66). This result indicates that HCOOH comes from the introduction of an inorganic carbon source rather than the exogenous carbon contamination in this reaction system. As the surface area-to-volume ratio (S/V ) increases, namely the reduction of the size of microdroplets, the ratio of interface region to interior region in microdroplets will be further enlarged (67). Clearly, HCOOH yield is positively correlated to the size of the microdroplets (Fig. 3F), suggesting that this crucial chemical process associated with the origin of life directly links to the abundant interface of the microdroplets. Sizedependent HCOOH yield kinetics was further validated in individual microdroplets of known size using the Raman analysis, where a confocal Raman spectroscopy coupled with an optical microscope (RENISHAWS inVia Raman microscope) was applied to determine HCOOH yield using the established calibration curve. Specifically, HCOOH has characteristic features of vibrational bands for Vs(C\u2013H) at \u223c2,950 cm\u22121, V(H2O) at \u223c3,420 cm\u22121, and the intensity ratio Vs(C\u2013H)/V(H2O) exhibits a good linear relationship with HCOOH concentration (Fig. S10A and B). On this basis, we quantified the HCOOH yield in the microdroplet reaction system and our quantification results show a significant increase in HCOOH yield as the microdroplet diameter decreases from 534 to 10 \u03bcm, with an enhancement factor approximating 32 times. This agrees with the trend observed for the yield of HCOOH in microdroplets ranging from 100 to 500 \u03bcm by employing the IC method (Fig. S10C). All these observations provide valuable insights into the relationship between microdroplet size and HCOOH yield. This is consistent with the consensus that the remarkable performance of microdroplets correlates to their unique interface properties (68, 69).\nPhoto-induced inorganic carbon transformation progress analysis Before we set out to specify the complicated ZnS-bearing microdroplet reaction system, the basic mechanism of photo-induced inorganic carbon transformation on the surface of ZnS was first explored using in situ Diffuse Reflaxions Infrared Fourier Transformations Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis (Figs. 4A and S11) (70\u201375). There are several bands featured at 1,541, 1,506, 1,473, 1,351, and 1,330 cm\u22121, corresponding to the characteristic vibration of C=O[\u03bd(C=O)] and monodentate carbonate (m-CO32\u2212) (76), respectively. Meanwhile, these bands centered at 1,456, 1,436, and 1,417 cm\u22121 are indicative of the presence of adsorbed bicarbonate (HCO3\n\u2212), which is reported to be an intermediate species that is responsible for the subsequent HCOOH formation over the ZnS surface (77). Accumulating uptake of CO2 and H2O molecules on the ZnS surface leads to a significant increase in the abundance of (bi)carbonate species. The increase observed in the bands at 1,649, 1,741, 1,761, and 1,770 cm\u22121 verify the presence of HCOOH, and the band at 1,628 cm\u22121 is indicative of carboxylate formation. The intensity of the bands observed at 1,560 and 1,527 cm\u22121, corresponding to *COOH, shows a steady growth as illumination time prolongs. This trend can be potentially attributed to the strong proton capture capability of CO2 \u2022\u2212 radicals. Of\nutmost significance, the *HCOOH band at 1,707 cm\u22121 gradually increases as the light-induced reaction proceeds. These species are crucial intermediates in HCOOH formation. Specifically, the combination of band energy structure calculations with in situ DRIFTS analysis, we can deduce that upon solar irradiation the photogenerated electrons and holes are separated and transferred to the Zn and S of natural ZnS mineral, followed by the subsequent occurrence of redox reaction. On the Zn site, the conversion of CO2 to HCOOH involves two consecutive hydrogenation steps, with the first step involving the conversion of CO2 into *COOH, followed by a secondary reaction in which the formed *COOH undergoes secondary transformation to eventually yield HCOOH. On the other hand, the oxidation of H2O at the S site involves multiple conversion steps, when HCOOH is desorbed from the system, the two OH\u2022 radicals quench themselves to generate O2 and H2O, thus maintaining the charge balance of the catalytic system. In Fig. 4A and B, the formation of *COOH and OH\u2022 from CO2 and H2O is the rate-determining step in the process of the photocatalytic overall reaction (77, 78). In addition, two intermediates, *COOH and HCOO*, are produced in the first hydrogenation reaction. The *COOH is thermodynamically favorable since the energy of the formation of *COOH is lower than that of HCOO*. It is noteworthy that the energy required for the dehydration of *COOH into CO is considerably higher than that of *COOH hydrogenation into HCOOH. This observation is in line with the experimental observations, which demonstrate the HCOOH of high selectivity among the reduction products. Overall, the reaction pathway comprises three elementary steps. Initially, the chemisorbed CO2 or HCO3\n\u2212 accumulates on the ZnS surface. In the subsequent step, the occurrence of electron transfer upon excitation is accompanied by the HCOO* generation and contributes to the formation of HCOO\u2212 through a second electron transfer event. Finally, HCOO\u2212 desorbs from the catalyst surface to complete a typical redox cycle. As the semisolvation effect is the fundamental driving force to trigger fast solardriven CO2 reduction in the \u201cmicrodroplet\u201d reaction chamber of our concern (detailed in Discussion section), reaction processes and intermediates involved are routinely considered to be the same (32, 34, 79), although CO2 reduction to HCOOH occurs in air\u2013water interface and bulk medium, respectively.\nThermodynamic aspect concerning HCOOH production in microdroplets suspended with sphalerite Recall that the unique dynamic behavior of the solvation shell at the interface can alter the charge transfer efficiency or the redox capability (68), which has been evidenced to play a crucial role in organic synthesis in a \u201cmicrodroplet\u201d reaction chamber. On this basis, one can expect that photochemical redox will be strengthened for sphalerite resided in the microdroplet interface. Generally, a large solvent energy barrier must be overcome in the bulk solution of multiple solvation shells, which greatly slows down the reaction (80). In stark contrast, for interfacial solute molecules of the incomplete solvent cage, i.e. semisolvation, the heterolysis of the covalent bond will contribute to the fast separation of charges of electron\u2013hole pairs emitted from sphalerite upon irradiation, which can further reduce the energy of the transition state of CO2RR intermediates, leaving the activation energy of the reaction being reduced and the reaction speed being greatly accelerated (81). In light of this, DFT in conjunction with the projectoraugmented wave method is applied to calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) both in bulk and microdroplet reaction and further to gain a deep insight into the reaction mechanism behind the\nGe et al. | 5 D\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /pnasnexus/article/2/11/pgad389/7420968 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nsignificant yield of HCOOH in a ZnS-bearing microdroplet system of pronounced partial solvation effects (the details are available in Materials and methods section) (32, 33, 58, 82).\nFigure 4C and D shows the thermodynamic energetics of the key reaction intermediates involved in the microdroplet and bulk ZnS suspension systems. CO2 accepts one electron given by the ZnS mineral to produce COO\u2212* and the free energy increases, suggesting that the first electron transfer from the ZnS surface to CO2 is the rate-determining step. Clearly, when the reaction occurs at the air\u2013water interface, the partially solvated reactant and TS of more localized charges reduce the difference between the energy of reactant (CO2*) and TS (COO\n\u2212*) from 0.11 to 0.08 eV and thus increase the reaction rate constant at the interface accordingly. The promising \u201cmicrodroplet\u201d reaction system observed for HCOOH production relative to the bulk phase reaction is consistent with our early laboratory-based observation (9). When the photoreduction reaction occurs in the microdroplet,\nthe activation barrier of the overall reaction process can be significantly reduced and thus beneficial for HCOOH production. The \u0394G of CO2 reduction to HCOOH in bulk solution is \u22120.68 eV, while it is \u22120.85 eV in microdroplets, which means that microdroplets alter the kinetics and thermodynamics of photoreduction inorganic carbon. In bulk solution, large solvation-energy barriers that are required for reactions to occur should be overcome, which greatly slows the reaction rate, while at the air\u2013water interface, reduced desolvation energy is required for the reagent with an open solvent shell. The semisolvation effect gives rise to the molecular organization and alignment of reactants at the air\u2013water interface of the microdroplet surface, thus contributing to the reduction of the entropic change (33). This result agrees well with the early finding where the phosphorylation of ribose is thermodynamically unfavorable (5.6 kcal mol\u22121), while it shows Gibbs free energy of \u22121.1 kcal mol\u22121 in the microdroplet reaction system of the same reaction process (32). The underlying mechanism can be\nFig. 4. ZnS-mediated inorganic carbon reduction pathways. A) In situ DIFTS spectra for the photoreduction reaction.

D) Free energy diagram for the pathway of CO2 conversion into HCOOH in microdroplet system and bulk phase reaction, indicating the electron/proton transfer process at the (001) surface of ZnS.\n6 | PNAS Nexus, 2023, Vol. 2, No. 11 D\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /pnasnexus/article/2/11/pgad389/7420968 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nexplained by the enlarged bond dipole and ordered orientation of reactant molecules residing at air/water interface, which therefore reduce the entropy of the initial state and increase the free energy of the initial state (68). A similar observation of favorable energetic variation has been found for the nonnegligible affinity of free OH radicals toward the air\u2013water interface, which instantaneously alters electrophilicity/nucleophilicity, HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital)\u2013LUMO (Lower Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) gap, and other reactivity indicators of the complex to trigger the fast reaction within the incomplete solvation shell (83\u201385). Overall, we observe that the microdroplet chamber had a reduced entropic cost compared with the reaction in the bulk aqueous system. This explains the extremely high yield of formic acid during the photochemical process, where the ZnS mineral in the droplet efficiently converts inorganic carbon to HCOOH.\nImplications for microdroplet photoreactive mineral in initial prebiotic Earth systems In the early prebiotic Earth systems, the total flux of intense ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation is eight times greater than that at the present age, with abundant aerosol water estimated to be approximately 1,000-fold that of the contemporary Earth\u2019s atmosphere (86). Mineral dust can enter into aerosol or cloud microdroplets and their absorption of extreme UVC has laid the foundation for the occurrence of life in the primitive Earth (Fig. 5C). To estimate the abiotic production of organic molecules and evaluate the role of the ZnS microdroplet proposed in this work, an ideal numerical calculation by supposing that ZnS particles suspended in the aerosol microdroplet was performed. The functional relationships between the HCOOH yield (YHCOOH) and ZnS concentration (CZnS), surface-to-volume of microdroplet (S/V ), and light intensity (I ) were derived regression analysis of condition dependence in laboratory-based measurement (Eqs. 6\u20138, Figs. 3F inset and S12\u2013S14). These parameters altogether determine the total yield of HCOOH in mineral ZnS droplets during the atmospheric photochemical process. Based on the above results, we simulated the yield of formic acid under the joint coupling influence of three factors, namely different mineral concentrations, different S/V or microdroplet sizes, and different light intensities (Fig. 5A, calculation details are available in the Materials and methods section). Notably, in early Earth-relevant conditions, the amount of HCOOH produced by the numerical calculation is dependent on ZnS concentration (CZnS), surface-tovolume microdroplet (S/V ), and light intensity (I ). The production of HCOOH from inorganic carbon in this pathway is higher comparable with other organics with higher molecular weight like formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and amino acids, which have been documented as other abiotic conversion pathways of inorganic carbon, e.g. impact shocks, and lightning, respectively. Accordingly, based on the determined correlations between yield and I, S/V, and CZnS (Eqs. 9\u201311), we estimated an extremely high HCOOH yield up to 2.518 \u00d7 1014 kg year\u22121 by applying the parameters reported for early Earth conditions (1). More significantly, the conversion of HCOOH to other complicated biomolecules has a reducing potential of \u22120.11 V (vs. NHE at pH 7) for methane and 0.07 V for acetic acid. The multistep synthesis of macromolecules based on HCOOH is thermodynamically favorable in the natural universal \u201cmicrodroplet\u201d chambers comprising mineral sphalerite.\nWe further explored the acceleration effect for microdroplet and bulk reaction systems regarding the inorganic carbon photoreduction process across a wide range of authentic minerals and clays (Fig. 5B). Clearly, all minerals and clays, i.e. CuS, NiS, CoS,\nCdS, MnS, elemental sulfur, Arizona Test Dust (ATD), loess, nontronite, and montmorillonite, show remarkable enhancement when they exist in the microdroplet system relative to the bulk one, typically 1\u20132 orders of magnitude. This observation further emphasizes the generality of the naturally synthesized process by inorganic carbon source for biomolecular origin within mineral-bearing microdroplet reaction systems, which may be even more significant than we are now investigating here and thus provide an alternative and efficient abiogenic pathway to produce biomolecules considering the significant increase in HCOOH yield in the microdroplets relative to the conventional bulk phase reaction regardless of the types of authentic minerals and clays (Fig. 5B). In the early Earth's atmosphere, the formic acid produced within the aerosol or cloud microdroplets can undergo subsequent photochemical processes to generate fatty acids. These fatty acids, in turn, have the capability to form vesicle structures, creating a relatively closed space that facilitates the formation of more complex life-building reactions. On the other hand, diverse metrics of aerosol particles full of natural minerals may potentially convert atmospheric CO2 to esters, analogous to the acetyl-Coenzyme A pathway. These esters can further be involved in the synthesis of essential biomolecules, such as amino acids and ribonucleotides, thus offering the ideal building blocks for the emergence of life (Fig. 5C)."

            "text": "In summary, the natural prebiotic reactions utilizing inorganic carbon in the aerosol microdroplet of abundant air\u2013water interface contribute to an unrecognized high yield of HCOOH, which is over two orders of magnitude higher than that in bulk phase reaction. This can be explained by the decrease in entropy change of chemical reactions in microdroplets of semisolvation effect, where the molecular structure and arrangement of reactants at the air\u2013water interface allow the reaction more thermodynamically favorable compared with the bulk phase. Notably, on the contemporary and early Earth, aqueous microdroplets and airwater interfaces are ubiquitous in the natural environments, including the surface of oceans, lakes, and hydrothermal vents. As an important part of the reaction of the origin of life in hydrothermal vents, mineral aerosol microdroplets extensively exist in hydrothermal vents (87) and play an important role in the process of the origin of life reaction. Moreover, the integrated surface area of aqueous aerosol particles that partially come from the ocean can be several orders of magnitude larger than the surface area of the ocean itself. In the primitive Earth environment, more than 90% of the Earth\u2019s surface was covered by oceans (8), and the interface abundance of aqueous atmospheric aerosol particles was more than that found in nowadays conditions. During their lifetime, atmospheric aerosols experience a complicated aging process, with variations in temperature, relative humidity, pH, salinity, solar light exposure as well as interaction with other gasphase species, and undergo diverse physical processes including coagulation, hydration, and dehydration. In this case, large quantities of water\u2013air interfaces over oceans, lakes, aerosols, and cloud and fog droplets essentially provide favorable microenvironments for the natural prebiotic synthesis. During the photochemical processes of the origin of life in the natural airborne mineral-bearing droplet particles, the activation energy barrier of the overall reaction process can be significantly reduced in the microdroplet system, thus remarkably promoting the production of basic biomolecule block HCOOH than what previously considered. Additionally, this work potentially provides a\nGe et al. | 7 D\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /pnasnexus/article/2/11/pgad389/7420968 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nnew perspective on the element cycle of sulfur and carbon. Specifically, airborne mineral dust-bearing microdroplet particles serve as a highly efficient \u201cnatural\u201d carbon and sulfur storage system in the primitive Earth environment. On the one hand, atmospheric carbon dioxide from geologic activity can be efficiently transformed into the basic organic molecule within the aerosol particles, and these carbon sources will eventually be brought back to the ocean and continental land through the dry or wet deposition process. At the same time, a minor fraction of the \u201cnaturally synthesized\u201d multicarbon organic compounds within these airborne microdroplets is speculated to undergo a photolysis process in response to ultraviolet light radiation, resulting in the formation of inorganic carbon that subsequently becomes an integrated part of the atmospheric carbon cycle. On the other hand, photochemically, sulfide minerals are documented to be\nexcellent hole sacrificial agents during the CO2RR process, thus leading to the formation of sulfur oxides or by-product sulfate. This sulfur mineralization process contributes to atmospheric sulfur dioxide and leads to the sulfur cycle in primitive atmospheres. To conclude, the microdroplet photochemical reaction regarding the origin of the life system provides a novel perspective and significant abiogenic pathway to understand biomolecule production in the early Earth environment."

The solar-driven reaction chamber (schematic diagram available in Fig. S6) enables inorganic carbon source gasphase CO2 or aqueous bicarbonate to be properly introduced into the reaction system before light experiments. In Fig. S3, the photocatalysts were still uniformly dispersed in the microdroplets after standing for 180 min, which confirmed the great dispersal of catalysts during the photocatalysis reaction and the feasibility of microdroplet photocatalysis. (Note: a black tetrafluoroethylene hydrophobic carbon paper was used for microdroplet observation.) For bulk phase photocatalysis experiments, 3 mL of colloidal solution was added into a quartz Petri dish (diameter = 30 mm). The photoreduction of inorganic carbon in microdroplets was performed using a custom-designed quartz reactor that can maintain high humidity (90%) and low temperature (Fig. S6). At a given time interval, the microdroplets were then collected and quantitatively diluted using deionized water for further analysis. The products in the liquid phase were analyzed by IC (using a Metrohm 883 Basic IC system equipped with a Metrosep A supply 5-250/4.0 analytical column and a conductivity detector), and the gaseous products were detected using a GC-TCD instrument (Shimadzu GC-2014) with a 5-\u00c5 molecular sieve packing column. Other metal-sulfide minerals, as well as loess, ATD, montmorillonite, and nontronite, were dispersed into water (concentration of 1 g L\u22121), and then\nGe et al. | 9 D\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /pnasnexus/article/2/11/pgad389/7420968 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nproduced by sprayer droplets in the abovementioned reactor (25 mM NaHCO3, light intensity 1.48 mW cm\n\u22122, high humidity 90%, 310 nm)."
