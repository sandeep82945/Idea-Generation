Computer engineering is a distinct disci pline that requires its own curriculum. The global semiconductor renaissance, in which many countries are increas ing their support for the semiconductor industry, provides motivation to con sider computer engineering curricula and learn from best practices.\nComputer engineering encompasses both hardware and software topics. The design of digital systems is one foundation for computer engineer ing. Realtime and lowpower software design encompasses software design for hardwarelike requirements.

Koch Professor of Engineering and Director for ORED Engineering and Technology Initiatives at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA. Her research interests include embedded computing, embedded computer vision, and very large scale integrated systems. She is a Fellow of IEEE and Association for Computing Machinery and an IEEE Computer Society Golden Core member. Contact her at mwolf@unl.edu.\nJAN MADSEN is a full professor in computer-based systems and head of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (DTU Compute) at the Technical University of Denmark, DK-2800 Kongens Lyngby, Denmark. His research interests are in the intersection between computer science and biotechnology, with a special focus on design, modeling, and construction of microelectronic (MPSoC and IoT), microfluidic (Lab-on-Chip) and microbiological (molecular) computing systems, including the development of design automation tools and design methodologies. Madsen received a Ph.D. in computer science from Technical University of Denmark. He is a board member of EDAA and a fellow of the Danish Academy of Technical Sciences, where he is a member of the Council of Digital Experts and serves in the Council for Technology and Society. He is a Member of IEEE and ACM, and a fellow of DATE.

Many different types of computer sys tems have been developed to meet the needs of different applications. Com puter engineering provides techniques to create an appropriate hardware/ software architecture for an applica tion. Computer engineering methods can be used to build the appropriate\nhardware and software pieces. Design creation and verification are all within the scope of computer engineering.\nThis special issue includes three articles that discuss approaches to the hardware, software, and applica tion aspects of computer engineer ing education.\nThe first articleA1 describes a curric ulum option for computer engineering undergraduates to specialize in chip design. The article discusses the cur riculum design to prepare students for careers in chip design and verification.\nThe second articleA2 describes a course on the hardware and software tradeoffs in the design of artificialin telligence\u2013enabled devices for the edge of the Internet. A hardware prototype provides students with the ability to design edge device software.\nThe third articleA3 describes an operating system designed to teach concepts in multiprocessor operat ing systems. The operating system helps students learn about parallel ism and multiprocessors at the soft ware level.\nIEEE Computer Graphics and Applications bridges the theory and practice of computer graphics.
