            "text": "Sleepy driving is a major obstacle to creating a safe traffic environment. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that the probability of road traffic accidents for sleepy drivers is 1.29~1.34 times as high as that of non-sleepy drivers [1]. In China, sleepy driving or poor sleep quality as a threat to road safety has attracted the attention of many researchers [2, 3]. Sleepy driving behaviour is multifactorial in nature, and driver attitude is one of the important factors [4]. Many studies have demonstrated that a driver\u2019s attitude towards risky driving behaviours (including sleepy driving) is closely associated with an increased frequency of risky behaviours while driving [5, 6]. For example, one study found that 81% of drivers believed that driving while sleepy has an adverse impact on their ability to drive safely, and 80% of drivers thought sleepy driving impaired their judgement while driving [7]. Therefore, measuring drivers\u2019 attitudes towards sleepy driving is crucial for driving safety.\nTo date, many instruments using self-reported methods have been developed to measure\nattitudes and beliefs towards sleepy driving [8, 9]. For example, in one study, a series of closedended questions was designed to probe respondents\u2019 attitudes, concerns, and self-reported behaviours related to sleepy driving [8]. These variables were also measured by asking subjects to complete five posture items (comprised of five pairs of bipolar adjectives) under three drowsy driving situations [9]. Moreover, the Attitudes and Beliefs about Sleepy Driving Scale (ABSDS) and driving diaries were used to measure driving attitudes [7]. The ABSDS revealed that the majority of participants believed that individuals should not drive while falling asleep and understand the consequences of sleepy driving, but they thought that sleepiness had little effect on their decision-making and distractibility. This study aimed to adapt the ABSDS to the Chinese language and examine its reliability and validity to provide a valid instrument for assessing drivers\u2019 attitudes towards sleepy driving in China.\nAttitude towards sleepy driving, driving behaviours and traffic violations\nPrevious studies have found that sleepiness or drowsiness during driving is an important factor leading to dangerous driving behaviours and traffic accidents [1, 4, 10]. Studies have found that sleepy driving or feeling drowsy while driving is associated with slower detection of road hazards [11, 12], frequent distracted driving [13] and impairment of vehicle control [14]. Sleepiness-related accidents often occur as a consequence of driving errors. Sleepy drivers cannot compensate, resulting in effects such as deterioration of steering quality, a reduction in lane-keeping accuracy, and drivers becoming out of the control loop during automated driving [15].\nHowever, only a few studies have examined the relationships between attitudes towards\nsleepy driving and risky driving behaviours and traffic accidents. Studies found that drivers who reported more favourable attitudes towards sleepy driving behaviour were more likely to engage in sleepy driving behaviours [16, 17]. A second study found that participants thought sleepy driving behaviour was less dangerous than driving with a high blood alcohol concentration, and drivers who believed that sleepy driving behaviour was less dangerous were more likely to perform the behaviour [4]. However, other studies have found that attitude about sleepy driving cannot predict traffic violations, as people\u2019s worries intensify when they think that sleepy driving is dangerous; as a result, drivers\u2019 sleepy driving behaviour may decrease [8]. For example, one study found that drivers showed more avoidance behaviours under sleepy conditions than under sober conditions [7]. Given the inconsistency in the literature, the relationship between attitudes towards sleepy driving and traffic accidents needs to be further investigated.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269312 June 2, 2022 2 / 11\nDespite the associations between drivers\u2019 attitudes towards sleepy driving and risky driving\nbehaviours [16, 17], few studies have explored safe or prosocial driving behaviours and their associations with attitudes towards road safety. Prosocial driving behaviour is a safe driving behaviour that protects the well-being of road users [18]. To better establish the relationship between drivers\u2019 attitudes towards sleepy driving and safe and unsafe driving behaviours, the Prosocial and Aggressive Driving Inventory (PADI) was used in this study to validate the ABSDS.\nAttitude towards sleepy driving and demographic factors\nRegarding the associations between demographic factors and attitude towards sleepy driving, mixed results have been reported. Gender differences in attitudes towards sleepy driving were found, with male drivers showing a more favourable attitude towards sleepy driving than female drivers [19]. One study found that the more objective the attitude towards sleepy driving among female drivers was, the more prosocial driving behaviour they have [20]. Regarding age, compared to older drivers, younger drivers reported more positive attitudes towards sleepy and drunk driving behaviours, and younger drivers were also more likely to report exhibiting sleepy driving behaviours than older drivers [16, 21]. However, other studies found that age is negatively related to drivers\u2019 attitudes towards sleepy driving [22]. Older age and the belief of having a perceived ability to overcome sleepiness results in an increased likelihood of continuing to drive while sleepy [22]. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the relationships between demographic factors and sleepy driving attitudes in a sample of Chinese drivers."

However, no gender differences were found from item 3 to item 5. These results were supported by the findings of previous studies showing that alcohol impairs drivers\u2019 perceptions more than feeling sleepy [24], and the dangers of driving drowsily are more likely to be downplayed or ignored than those of drunk or drug driving [13]. This study found that younger, less experienced male drivers were more tolerant of sleepy driving. That is, increases in age and driving experience make drivers opposed to sleepy driving. Previous studies have found that younger drivers have a more positive attitude towards sleepiness and drunk driving compared to older drivers [21], and young drivers\u2019 supportive attitudes towards sleepy driving are effective predictor of sleepy-related behaviours and traffic accidents [25]. There are contradictory results showing that drivers\u2019 age is positively correlated with sleepy driving behaviours in a sample of 137 young drivers aged 18 to 25 years [16, 22]. One possible explanation is that younger drivers (18\u201325 years old) have a limited amount of driving experience, including driving while sleepy and driving at night, which could result in newly licensed drivers deciding not to engage in sleepy driving behaviours.\nFurthermore, ABSDS score is positively correlated with prosocial driving behaviours and\nnegatively correlated with aggressive driving behaviours, showing its discriminant validity was acceptable. Notably, the scale score can positively predict prosocial driving behaviours and negatively predict aggressive driving behaviours. Studies have shown that drivers\u2019 age and attitude have more influence on drowsy driving than personality traits or risk-taking factors, and a positive attitude towards drowsy driving makes drivers choose prosocial driving behaviours such as parking to ensure the safety of other drivers [26, 27]. Although many studies have demonstrated that sleepy driving leads to more risky driving and accidents, this study found that drivers who support sleepy driving exhibit fewer prosocial behaviours. The findings provide a new perspective for enhancing driving safety in China by taking attitudes towards sleepy driving into consideration when interventions were developed.\nFinally, this study found that drivers\u2019 approval of sleepy driving is positively correlated with their numbers of traffic violations and accidents, although few participants reported traffic violations (16.6%) or traffic accidents (15%) in the past year. More importantly, ABSDS score can significantly predict drivers\u2019 violation and accident involvement in last 12 months. One possible explanation is that a lower perceived legitimacy and ignoring the dangers of sleepy driving or having a perceived ability to overcome sleepiness lead to more violations and accidents [5, 28]. The results show direct associations between drivers\u2019 attitudes towards sleepy driving and the number of traffic accidents and can be used to develop interventions targeted at attitudes towards sleepy driving in China.\nGiven driver education initiatives with respect to sleepy driving are limited in China; one strategy is to make the testing of knowledge about sleepy driving a compulsory part in driver education and assessment. For instance, drivers whose driving licenses were suspended due to traffic violations and accidents that related to sleepy driving (fines up to 12 points) must attend safety education to re-obtain their licenses. During this session, measures of those drivers\u2019 attitudes toward sleepy driving and the changes of their attitudes that sleepy driving is acceptable might help improve the effectiveness of driver education. Studies have found that an effective behaviour change approach requires the discovery of a determinant of predicted behaviour, the ability to change that determinant, and the translation into practical application in a way that is appropriate to the target population [29]. Given the results obtained in the present study, attitude about sleepy driving can be a determinant that could be easily evaluated and monitored in different phrases of driver education. Another promising way is to teach drivers who are prone to traffic violations and accidents to identify the signs of sleepiness while driving and to learn some sleepiness countermeasures, as evidence have shown that moderately\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269312 June 2, 2022 8 / 11\nsleep deprived individuals can identify increasing sleepiness and then take action to cease a hazard perception task [12, 30]."

However, as in previous studies [7\u20139], self-reported methods seemed to be the most suitable when exploring drivers\u2019 attitude, motivation and driving behaviours. Future studies should include more objective measure of sleepy-related driving behaviours. Second, although the present study found that drivers\u2019 attitudes and beliefs about sleepy driving are related to the number of traffic accidents, a follow-up study is needed to reveal the influences of attitudes and beliefs about sleepy driving on crash risk in the future. For instance, researchers can further explore the predictive validity of the ABSDS on drivers\u2019 crash risk in a six-month or one-year period. Finally, the present study recruited 520 private car drivers of varying driving experience and age from four cites that geographically represent Chinese cities, which is enough given the main purpose of this study is to revise the 7-item ABSDS. However, future studies with larger samples are needed to further provide more evidence regarding the validity of the newly-developed scale for Chinese drivers.\nThe findings of the present study have some implications. Firstly, this study provides a reli-\nable and validate instrument for assessing Chinese drivers\u2019 attitudes toward sleepy driving. Although objective data about the attitudes toward sleepy driving is valuable, the consistency between objectively and subjectively measured attitudes toward sleepy driving might provide a new perspective in driver assessment and education. In this regard, the 7-item scale could serve as a short and time-saving tool when it was incorporated into the assessment of attitudes toward sleepy driving. Secondly, the newly-developed scale can be used to identify drivers who are prone to traffic accidents, thus helping strengthening injury prevention in China. Consistent with the findings of previous studies [4, 16], the present study found that drivers who showed more supportive attitude towards sleepy driving have a higher chance to be involved in traffic violations and accidents than those drivers who thought sleepy driving is dangerous."

Our findings show that drivers\u2019 attitudes towards sleepy driving are associated with prosocial and aggressive driving behaviours.

The associations between ABSDS score and traffic accidents also highlight that safety education and interventions targeting at changing drivers\u2019 supportive attitudes towards sleepy driving are beneficial for enhancing road safety in China."
