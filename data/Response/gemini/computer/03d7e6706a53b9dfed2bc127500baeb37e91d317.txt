1. **Investigate the use of different interpolation methods in the EPFA.** The paper uses a 2-D interpolation method to map the data from the slant-range plane to the azimuth-wavenumber domain. However, other interpolation methods, such as the nearest neighbor method or the bilinear interpolation method, could also be used. It would be interesting to compare the performance of the EPFA using different interpolation methods.


2. **Develop a more accurate model for the wavefront curvature error.** The paper uses a 2-D Taylor series expansion to model the wavefront curvature error. However, this model is only an approximation, and it may not be accurate enough for some applications. It would be interesting to develop a more accurate model for the wavefront curvature error, such as a model based on a higher-order Taylor series expansion or a model based on a different mathematical function.


3. **Apply the EPFA to other types of SAR data.** The paper only applies the EPFA to HRHS SAR data. However, the EPFA could also be applied to other types of SAR data, such as wide-swath SAR data or stripmap SAR data. It would be interesting to investigate the performance of the EPFA on these other types of SAR data.


4. **Develop a real-time implementation of the EPFA.** The paper does not discuss the real-time implementation of the EPFA. However, a real-time implementation of the EPFA would be necessary for some applications, such as SAR imaging from moving platforms. It would be interesting to develop a real-time implementation of the EPFA and to investigate its performance.


5. **Investigate the use of the EPFA for other applications.** The paper only discusses the use of the EPFA for SAR imaging. However, the EPFA could also be used for other applications, such as radar imaging or sonar imaging. It would be interesting to investigate the use of the EPFA for these other applications.
