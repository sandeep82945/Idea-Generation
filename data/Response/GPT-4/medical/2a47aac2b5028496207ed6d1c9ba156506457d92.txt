Cross-Domain Knowledge Injection: Investigate the impact of cross-domain knowledge injection by leveraging ontologies from related fields outside of biomedicine (e.g., environmental science, biochemistry, and pharmacology) to see if contextual knowledge from these areas can further improve RE performance. This research could explore how knowledge from related domains enriches entity understanding and relation extraction, particularly for entities and relations that span multiple domains.

Dynamic Knowledge Base Updating: Develop methods for dynamic updating of knowledge bases used in the K-RET system. As biomedical knowledge rapidly evolves, a system that can automatically incorporate new findings and update its knowledge base would be highly beneficial. This could include real-time parsing of new publications, automated ontology updates, and methods for verifying and validating new knowledge entries.

Explainable AI (XAI) in RE Systems: Enhance the K-RET system with explainable AI techniques to provide insights into how external knowledge influences relation extraction decisions. This research would focus on making the knowledge injection process transparent, allowing users to understand why and how certain knowledge contributions affect the system's performance. It could involve the development of visualization tools and interpretability layers within the RE system.

Multi-token Entity Recognition Enhancement: While K-RET addresses multi-token entities, further research could focus on enhancing the recognition and disambiguation of complex multi-token entities. This could involve advanced NLP techniques for entity boundary detection, context-aware entity matching, and the use of deep learning models specialized in understanding the nuanced meanings of biomedical entities in different contexts.

Federated Learning for Biomedical RE: Explore the use of federated learning to improve biomedical relation extraction while addressing data privacy concerns. By training models on decentralized data sources without exchanging the data itself, this approach could enable the integration of knowledge from sensitive or proprietary biomedical databases. Research could focus on optimizing federated learning algorithms for knowledge injection and RE tasks, ensuring robust performance across diverse data sources while maintaining data privacy.
