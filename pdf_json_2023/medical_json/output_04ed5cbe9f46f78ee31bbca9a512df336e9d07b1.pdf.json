    "abstractText": "The complex interaction between tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells through soluble factors provides essential cues for breast cancer progression. TAMs-targeted therapies have shown promising clinical therapeutical potential against cancer progression. The molecular mechanisms underlying the response to TAMs-targeted therapies depends on complex dynamics of immune cross-talk and its understanding is still incomplete. In vitro models are helpful to decipher complex responses to combined immunotherapies. In this study, we established and characterized a 3D human macrophage-ER PR HER2 breast cancer model, referred to as macrophagetumor spheroid (MTS). Macrophages integrated within the MTS had a mixed M2/ M1 phenotype, abrogated the anti-proliferative effect of trastuzumab on tumor cells, and responded to IFN\u03b3 with increased M1-like polarization. The targeted treatment of MTS with a combined CSF1R kinase inhibitor and an activating antiCD40 antibody increased M2 over M1 phenotype (CD163/CD86 and CD206/ CD86 ratio) in time, abrogated G2/M cell cycle phase transition of cancer cells, promoted the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and reduced cancer cell viability. In comparison, combined treatment in a 2D macrophage-cancer cell co-culture model reduced M2 over M1 phenotype and decreased cancer cell viability. Our work shows that this MTS model is responsive to TAMs-targeted therapies, and may be used to study the response of ER PR HER2 breast cancer lines to novel TAM-targeting therapies.",

TAMs-targeted therapies have shown promising clinical therapeutical potential against cancer progression. The molecular mechanisms underlying the response to TAMs-targeted therapies depends on complex dynamics of immune cross-talk and its understanding is still incomplete. In vitro models are helpful to decipher complex responses to combined immunotherapies. In this study, we established and characterized a 3D human macrophage-ER+ PR+ HER2+ breast cancer model, referred to as macrophagetumor spheroid (MTS). Macrophages integrated within the MTS had a mixed M2/ M1 phenotype, abrogated the anti-proliferative effect of trastuzumab on tumor cells, and responded to IFN\u03b3 with increased M1-like polarization. The targeted treatment of MTS with a combined CSF1R kinase inhibitor and an activating antiCD40 antibody increased M2 over M1 phenotype (CD163+/CD86+ and CD206+/ CD86+ ratio) in time, abrogated G2/M cell cycle phase transition of cancer cells, promoted the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and reduced cancer cell viability. In comparison, combined treatment in a 2D macrophage-cancer cell co-culture model reduced M2 over M1 phenotype and decreased cancer cell viability. Our work shows that this MTS model is responsive to TAMs-targeted therapies, and may be used to study the response of ER+ PR+ HER2+ breast cancer lines to novel TAM-targeting therapies.\nKEYWORDS\nbreast cancer, macrophages, spheroids, 3Dmodel, cancer immunotherapy, CD40, CSF1R inhibitor\n1 Introduction\nCancer growth and progression are strongly supported by monocytes recruited early on to the tumor microenvironment (TME) during tumorigenesis. Upon recruitment, monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which in turn differentiate toward a so-called tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) phenotype facilitating metastatic cascade of cancer cells (Lin et al., 2019). A high density of TAMs generally correlates with worse clinical outcome in cancer patients (Qian and Pollard, 2010; Herrera et al., 2013; Vinogradov,\nOPEN ACCESS\nEDITED BY Federica Conte, National Research Council (CNR), Italy\nREVIEWED BY Marjan Rafat, Vanderbilt University, United States Giovanni Pecoraro, IRCCS SYNLAB SDN, Italy\n*CORRESPONDENCE Manuel Rodriguez-Perdigon, mrodriguez.41@alumni.unav.es\nRECEIVED 06 February 2023 ACCEPTED 26 May 2023 PUBLISHED 06 June 2023\nCITATION Rodriguez-Perdigon M, Haeni L, Rothen-Rutishauser B and R\u00fcegg C (2023), Dual CSF1R inhibition and CD40 activation demonstrates antitumor activity in a 3D macrophageHER2+ breast cancer spheroid model.

Notably TAMs may account for up to 50% of the cellular tumor mass (Solinas et al., 2009; Chanmee et al., 2014), and can acquire diverse phenotypes and functionalities given their inherent plasticity. During their homeostatic adaptation, TAMs\u2019 phenotypic and transcriptomic traits are concurrently modulated in continuous response to local cytokines, metabolites and/or interaction with cancer cells and other immune cells of the TME. Recently, attempts to establish a consensus in unifying models of TAMs diversity based on \u201comics\u201d studies, suggest that one TAMs subset can perform multiple functions and, conversely, multiple subsets can perform a specific function across different cancer types (Ma, Black, and Qian, 2022). Also, diverse TAMs\u2019 functions based on their location relative to the tumor mass have been proposed (Yang et al., 2018). Multifaced therapeutic approaches have been developed to prevent or suppress TAMs pro-tumoral functions and thereby to potentially reduce cancer cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis (Xiang et al., 2021). TAMs-targeted therapies can be divided globally into two categories: 1) depleting TAMs by blocking monocyte recruitment to the tumoral microenvironment and/or reducing TAMs\u2019 survival; 2) enforcing polarization from the M2-like pro-tumoral to a M1-like antitumoral phenotype (Biswas, Allavena, and Mantovani, 2013). Several repolarizing strategies such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) receptor activation and macrophage colonystimulating factor 1 (M-CSF1)/CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibition have revealed promising therapeutical potential in vivo in preclinical and clinical studies (Wang et al., 2022).\nThe M-CSF1/CSF1R axis pathway plays a crucial role for the differentiation and survival of macrophages (Sullivan and Pixley, 2014; Achkova and Maher, 2016). M-CSF1 is secreted by tumor cells and acts as an important regulator of tumor progression to metastasis by enhancing infiltration, survival and proliferation of M2-like macrophages (Jones and Ricardo, 2013). The cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40) molecule, a TNF-\u03b1 receptor family member and receptor for CD40 ligand (CD40L), has been considered and tested as additional target to modulate macrophage behavior and anti-tumor immune response. CD40 is particularly expressed in B cells, myeloid cells and monocytes/ macrophages (Piechutta and Berghoff, 2019). The activation of the CD40 pathway, mediated by either CD40L expressed in T cells or agonistic monoclonal antibody (anti-CD40 mAb), result in the upregulation of T cell co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., CD86, MHC) and the release of immunostimulatory and cytotoxic cytokines (e.g., IL-12, TNF-\u03b1) (Bennett et al., 1998; Ridge, Di Rosa, and Matzinger, 1998; Vonderheide, 2020), thereby enhancing cytotoxic T-cell activity impinging on cancer cell progression (Schoenberger et al., 1998; Quezada et al., 2004).\nAmong the different breast cancer subtypes, HER2+ breast cancer had an historically worse prognosis and high risk of metastasis in comparison to HER2\u2212 breast cancer. The introduction of anti-HER2 therapy with trastuzumab (Herceptin) profoundly changed its clinical management and improved its prognosis. Unfortunately, however, HER2+ breast cancer also develop resistance to anti-HER2 therapy (Ran et al., 2022). Moreover, and importantly for our model choice, some HER2+ breast cancers have been shown to express both M-CSF1 and CSF1R fostering the crosstalk between this cancer subtype and TAMs (Riaz et al., 2021). This crosstalk between cancer cells and TAMs\npromotes tumor formation, progression, and resistance to antiHER2 therapy (Morandi et al., 2011; Jones and Ricardo, 2013). Hence, we adopted HER2+ breast cancer for our MTS as clinically relevant model for targeted therapy and resistance.\nPromising biologics and/or small molecules blocking the M-CSF1/ CSF1R axis (Cannarile et al., 2017) or activating the CD40 pathway, have been developed (Djureinovic, Wang, and Kluger, 2021) and tested in preclinical and clinical studies. Recently, efforts have been made to combine both strategies in in vivo (Wiehagen et al., 2017; Perry et al., 2018) and clinical studies (Machiels et al., 2020). However clinical evidence of therapeutic benefits has been scant so far, owning in part to the limited understanding of the effect of these drugs on the dynamics between innate immune response, cancer cell proliferation and progression.\nClinically relevant in vitro models are necessary to predict human responses to drugs. Complex cancer 3D models, comprising adaptive and innate immune cells, have been elegantly developed and applied to study immune-cancer cell interactions (Vitale et al., 2022). Several studies tested the efficacy of combinations of chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy in 3D in vitro models (Della Corte et al., 2019; Amirghasemi et al., 2021; Helleberg Madsen et al., 2022), yet there is paucity of reports assessing the effect of combinations of TAMs-targeted therapies on macrophage-cancer cell interaction using in vitro models.\nTo address this need, here we developed an in vitro heterotypic human macrophage-ER+ PR+ HER2+ breast cancer cell 3D model, referred to as macrophage-tumor spheroid (MTS), and used it to investigate the effect of dual CSF1/CSF1R inhibition and CD40 activation. We observed that macrophages tend to localize at the periphery of the MTS; MTS treatment with a combined CSF1R kinase inhibitor and an activating anti-CD40 mAb increased M2 over M1 pro-tumoral phenotype (CD163/CD86 and CD206/CD86 marker ratios), abrogated G2/M phase transition of cancer cells, promoted the production of TNF-\u03b1 and reduced cancer cell viability.\nIn summary, we report a well-defined and responsive in vitro human MTS model potentially useful to assess the effects of combinations of TAMs-targeted immunotherapies in ER+ PR+ HER2+ breast cancer."

Viable MTS were produced by mixing macrophages derived by differentiation from human peripheral blood monocytes and cancer cells at a 4:1 ratio (seematerials andmethods for details). At 6 h after mixing, we observed the formation of small cellular aggregates around a core that evolved to form compact MTS within 24 h (Supplementary Figure S1A). Imaging of MTS showed that macrophages integrated into the cancer cell spheroid and tended to localize at its surface, with only rarely macrophages infiltrating the MTS core, at 28 h of assembling\n(Figure 1A; Supplementary Videos S1, S2). MTS displayed a rounded-aggregated morphology during 9 days of culture (Figure 1C) and a stable diameter of 325 \u00b5m in average at day 9 (Figure 1B). Macrophage viability dropped by about 75% at day 3 after assembly, in comparison to day 0 (Figure 1C).

In contrast, duringMTS assembly we did observe a slight increase in viable cancer cells, both in relative (%) (Mean \u00b1 SD of n = 3: 85.42% \u00b1 9.07%, 91.28 \u00b1+ 4.05% and 91.75 + 3.33% at 3, 6 and 9 days, respectively), as well as in absolute numbers (Mean \u00b1 SD of n = 3: 1230 \u00b1 834, 1451 \u00b1 589, 1575 \u00b1 626 cells per spheroid, at 3, 6 and 9 days, respectively) (Figure 1D).\nThe tumor mass can contain macrophage-cancer cell ratio from 0.1:1 up to 2:1, estimated in different types of tumors and stages (van Ravenswaay Claasen et al., 1992; Lin et al., 2002; Forssell et al., 2007; Solinas et al., 2009; Chanmee et al., 2014; Kn\u00fatsd\u00f3ttir, P\u00e1lsson, and Edelstein-Keshet, 2014). As shown in Figure 1D, macrophage viability is reduced to one-quarter when forming MTS at day 3. This leaves a ratio of viable 1:1 macrophage-cancer cell per MTS, which is representative of a clinically relevant situation based on the previous estimations found in literature.\nThe BT-474 cancer cell line grows well under 2D conditions at relatively high confluency, while its growth is reduced at low cell density. When growing in 3D conditions, BT-474 spheroids retain a steady and compact size over 10 and 15 days, without evidence of cell death, consistent with a low proliferation rate under 3D conditions. As comparison, the murine cell line 4T1, a murine model for triple negative breast cancer, produced spheroids of increasing size over 10 days with a similar compacted morphology, indicative of cell growth. However, at later timepoints spheroids (i.e., 15 days), the 4T1 spheroids disaggregated, and cell death debris formed around the spheroid, [in comparison to BT-474 (Supplementary Figure S1B)].\nFlow cytometry analysis showed that the M2/M1 like macrophages phenotype ratio (CD206/CD86 marker ratio) decreased along the assembling process, but this decrease was statistically non-significant (p= 0.187 and p= 0.111; day 3 vs. day 6 and day 9, respectively) (Figures 1E, F). Gating strategy for flow cytometry analysis for immunophenotypical characterization of MTS is shown in Supplementary Figure S1C. Overall, these results demonstrate the cellular architecture, viability and immunophenotype of a novel 3D macrophage-cancer cells in vitro model. We subsequently used this model for short-term drug treatments (<7 days)."

As for other anti-cancer treatments, HER2+ breast cancers treated with TZB, also exhibit acquired therapeutic resistance ultimately (Chung et al., 2013; Swain et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). Macrophages were reported to contribute to resistance to anti-HER2 therapy (Janiszewska et al., 2021). To assess the impact of the presence of macrophages on cancer cell sensitivity to TZB in our MTSmodel, we co-cultured HER2+ BT-474 breast cancer cells with (W) and without (WO) M2-like macrophages (Figure 2A).

            "text": "Next, we used our MTS model to investigate the effect of CSF1/ CSF1R pathway inhibition and CD40 activation, alone and in combination, on macrophage M2/M1 phenotype. To determine M2 to M1-like repolarization ratio, we monitored CD206/ CD86 and CD163/CD86 marker expression ratios, and to assess macrophage activation we measured HLA-DR expression by flow cytometry. At 4 days of treatment, exposure to agonistic anti-CD40 mAb and CSF1Ri, singly or in combination, did not significantly reduce the M2/M1-like polarization ratio (CD206/CD86 and CD163/CD86 marker ratios). There was, however, a trend toward reduced M2-like polarization at low CSF1Ri combined with antiCD40 mAb, while CSF1Ri alone had no detectable effects (Supplementary Figures S3A, B). Trends were more evident at day 7, with CSF1Ri dependent effects more pronounced, while anti-CD40 mAb appeared to have little to no further effect (Supplementary Figures S3D, E). HLA-DR expression, as marker of macrophage activation, showed a trend toward increased expression in response to CSF1Ri, which was further accentuated in combination with anti-CD40 mAb treatment over 4 days (Supplementary Figure S3C). Trends were more evident at day 7 of treatment. Highest expression of HLA-DR was found in 0.5 \u00b5M CSF1Ri-anti-CD40 mAb combined treatment in comparison to untreated control, yet none of the effects were statistically significant (Supplementary Figure S3F). Vehicle only treatment (VH) did not have any significant effect on any of these parameters (Supplementary Figures S3D\u2013F).\nWhen the effects of anti-CD40 mAb and 0.5 \u00b5M CSF1Ri treatments were analyzed at 4 vs. 7 days, we observed\nnevertheless a significant increase of the M2/M1 ratio over time. A significant increase of CD163/CD86 marker ratio (p < 0.05 vs. p < 0.01, respectively) from day 4 to day 7 occurred in the presence of single CSF1Ri and combined CSF1Ri-anti-CD40 mAb treatments (Figure 3A). Importantly, we observed a further significant increase of the CD206/CD86 marker ratio in macrophages in non-treated MTS, MTS treated with anti-CD40mAb, CSF1Ri and a combination thereof (p < 0.05, p < 0.01; p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001; respectively) (Figure 3B).\nWhile these experiments demonstrated that CSF1Ri and antiCD40 mAb treatments altered polarization of MTS macrophages, the polarization effect was unexpected as macrophages responded with an increased M2-like or pro-tumoral phenotype. We then wondered whether this unexpected effect could be related to the embedding of the macrophages in 3D MTS. To address this question, we exposed macrophages co-cultured with cancer cells under 2D conditions, to CSF1Ri and anti-CD40 mAb. CSF1Ri treatment caused a progressive reduction of the M2 to M1-like repolarization in a CSF1Ri concentration dependent-manner [i.e., significant reduction of CD163/CD86 marker ratio at 2 \u00b5M CSF1Ri vs. untreated control (p < 0.0001, respectively)] (Supplementary Figure S4A); and significant reduction of CD206/ CD86 marker ratio at 0.2 and 2 \u00b5M CSF1Ri vs. untreated control (p < 0.001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S4B). Addition of anti-CD40 mAb did not cause any additional effect on either M2 to M1 repolarization ratio (Supplementary Figures S4A, B). At high doses (i.e. 2 \u03bcM), CSF1Ri was cytotoxic causing approximately 20%\u201325% reduction in macrophage and tumor cell viability in comparison to untreated control (p < 0.0001, in both cases respectively) (Supplementary Figures S4C, D), also evident by the morphological degradation of the co-cultures (Supplementary Figure S4E). The experimental endpoint in cell viability studies of 2D co-cultures were chosen at 3 days when statistically significant differences were found in reduction of cancer cell viability.\nAs anti-CD40 mAb treatment appeared not to induce important biological effects, we tested whether macrophages responded to antiCD40 mAb by downregulating CD40 expression. Macrophages in 2D conditions were left untreated or exposed to 5, 50 or 250 nM of antiCD40 mAb for 3 days and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry. Results showed that 50 nM of anti-CD40mAb treatment downregulate CD40 expression (Supplementary Figures S5B, C), thus confirming binding and downstream activity of anti-CD40 mAb to the CD40 molecule. No major changes were observed in macrophage viability and morphology (Supplementary Figures S5A, C)."

Vehicle solution (VH) treatment did not significantly impact the viability of either cell type (Figure 4D). No significant reduction of cancer cell viability has been reported in other 3D immune-cancer models using CSF1Ri (<0.6 \u00b5M BLZ945 concentrations) (Pyonteck et al., 2013).\nAs BT-474 cancer cells were reported to express CSF1R protein and mRNA (Morandi et al., 2011), albeit at lower levels compared to M2-like macrophages (Jones and Ricardo, 2013), we tested for possible direct cytotoxic effects of CSF1Ri on BT-474 cells. Indeed, we observed an inhibitory effect of CSF1Ri in 2D BT-474 cell viability (IC50 = 111 \u00b5M) but at doses much higher than those tested in the MTS model (\u22642 \u00b5M) (Supplementary Figure S7).\nThese results indicate that high CSF1Ri concentrations lead to macrophage depletion only upon long-term treatments (>7 days) rather than \u201creprogramming\u201d a M1/M2 phenotype in our MTS model, consistent with previously published results (Zhu et al., 2014; Hoves et al., 2018).

Our 2D and 3D results are also consistent with the fact that macrophage survival mostly depends on CSF1/CSF1R axis signaling (Chitu and Stanley, 2006), rather by activation of the CD40 signaling pathway (Rescigno et al., 1998; Djureinovic, Wang, and Kluger, 2021)."

Previous studies in in vitro 3D macrophagefibroblast-pancreatic tumor models (Helleberg Madsen et al., 2022) showed that anti-CD40 mAb activated macrophages significantly and increased the secretion of various cytokines (i.e., CCL22, IL-10 and VEGF). No 3D in vitro assessment of CD40 activation and CSFR1 blockade efficacy has been previously reported.\nTogether these results indicate that combined treatments with agonistic anti-CD40 mAb and CSF1Ri induces a pro-inflammatory immune phenotype of MTS (increased secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and decreased secretion of IL-10 at 0.5 \u00b5M CSF1Ri concentration). This is consistent with previously published in vivo studies reporting that anti-CD40 mAb\u2014CSF1Ri treatment significantly increase TNF-\u03b1 secretion (Elgueta et al., 2009; Perry et al., 2018).

High concentrations of CSF1Ri (2 \u00b5M), regardless of the presence of anti-CD40 mAb, had no effect on TNF-\u03b1 or IL-10 release in comparison to untreatedMTS (Figure 6). These data support the notion that sustained treatment with high CSF1Ri concentrations lead to macrophage depletion (Figure 4B; Supplementary Figure S4C), resulting in reduced cytokine production in MTS, consistent with previous reports (Zhu et al., 2014; Quail et al., 2016; Hoves et al., 2018)."

However, these studies mostly focused on single drug treatments and neglected the analysis of combined TAMs-targeted therapies using clinically applicable drugs, in particular CSF1R inhibitors and anti-CD40 agonists (Alvey et al., 2017; Bauleth-Ramos et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020; Rose et al., 2020; Helleberg Madsen et al., 2022).\nTo address this question, we established a simple, well-defined 3Dmacrophage-tumor spheroid (MTS) co-culture model consisting of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and the human ER+ PR+ HER2+ breast cancer line BT-474 and used it to characterize the effects of CSF1R inhibition and CD40 activation. MTS formed rapidly (1 day) (Supplementary Figure S1A) and were stable for at least 9 days (Figures 1B\u2013D). During the initial stages of MTS assembling (between day 0 and 3), we observed a drastic decrease of macrophage viability (Figure 1D). This is likely due the death of na\u00efve macrophages before they could establish adhesive interactions with tumor cells (Ammon et al., 2000; Schittenhelm, Hilkens, and Morrison, 2017). Surviving macrophages integrated into the cancer cell spheroid and preferentially located at its surface, while only rare macrophages infiltrated the core (Figure 1A; Supplementary Videos S1, S2), reminiscent of initial stages of tumor development (Burugu, Asleh-Aburaya, and Nielsen, 2017; Liu et al., 2021). Our MTS model may resemble tumour nodules (<500 \u03bcm diameter) comprising stromal macrophages around incipient tumour as proposed previously in other models (Mellor, Ferguson, and Callaghan, 2005; Kempf et al., 2013). Broad evidence supports the notion that location of stromal macrophages in and around the tumor nest is relevant, as it dictates the polarization and consequently the pro- or anti-tumoral function of TAMs (Rivera, and Bergers, 2013; Lendeckel et al., 2022). Some studies have\nreported that HER2 status was positively correlated with stromal TAMs (Gwak et al., 2015), and their relevance as prognostic marker for breast cancer patients (Medrek et al., 2012).\nAlthough peripheral blood-derived monocytes were exposed to culture medium promoting M2-like differentiation, macrophages in MTS showed a mixed M2/M1 phenotype (Figure 1F). Importantly, upon integration they appeared to be functional as they did blunt the anti-proliferative effect of trastuzumab on BT-474 cancer cells (Figure 2) and responded to IFN\u03b3 treatment with differentiation toward M1-like phenotype (Supplementary Figure S2). MTS also responded to TAMs-targeting agonistic anti-CD40 mAb and CSF1Ri treatments, though in a more complex manner than originally anticipated. Single drug and combined treatments increased the M2 to M1-like phenotype of macrophages unexpectedly over time, in addition to a spontaneous M2 to M1like polarization (Figure 3). Remarkably, long-term combined TAMs-targeted treatment did not cause a decrease in macrophage viability. In contrast, cancer cells from MTS exposed to combined anti-CD40 mAb and CSF1Ri treatments showed a significant reduction in viability and G2/M cell cycle progression (Figures 4D, 5B). This indirect macrophage-tumor cells cross-talk in treated MTS was paralleled by the secretion of the pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic cytokines (i.e., TNF-\u03b1) (Figure 6A). Strikingly, in 2D conditions similar treatment conditions elicited a decreased of the M2 to M1-like phenotype polarization, which was accompanied with both macrophage and cancer viability reduction (Supplementary Figure S4).\nResults obtained in this study suggest the following conclusions:\ni) MDMs embedded in MTS consist of a mixture of M2-like and M1-like macrophages, which, after an initial non-significant drop during MTS assembly, over time spontaneously differentiate towards more M1-like phenotype (based on CD206/ CD86 marker expression) in unchanged conditioned medium.\nFIGURE 6 Treatment of MTS with CSF1Ri and anti-CD40mAb increases secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and reduces secretion of IL-10. (A) Secreted anti-tumoral cytokine TNF-\u03b1 is augmented in MTS and (B) secreted pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is reduced in MTS upon synergistic drug combination: untreated, 0.2, 0.5 and 2 \u00b5M inhibitor of CSF1R (CSF1Ri) and without (-anti-CD40 mAb) and with combination of 50 agonistic nM CD40 monoclonal antibody (+antiCD40 mAb). Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons. Results are considered significant when p < 0.05 (*) and <0.0001 (****) vs. corresponding CSF1Ri treated or untreated control. Results are expressed in duplicates as mean + standard deviation (n = 2).\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org12\nThis observation is consistent with reports showing that exposure of macrophages to triple negative breast cancer cell lines but not ER+ PR+ breast cancer cell lines, skews macrophages to a M2-like phenotype (Hollm\u00e9n et al., 2015; Sousa et al., 2015). Directly assigning pro- and antitumoral functions of TAMs based on the M1/M2 phenotype should be addressed with caution as macrophages can assume a more complex spectrum of phenotypes and functions depending on the context (Murray et al., 2014; A; Mantovani, 2016; Martinez and Gordon, 2014). The intrinsic and plastic modulation of the macrophage M2/ M1 phenotypes by different tumor-cell lines in 3D models (Kuen et al., 2017; Raghavan et al., 2019; Madsen et al., 2021; Helleberg Madsen et al., 2022), together with factors driving the transient or stable state of macrophage activation (M2-like to M1-like phenotype) along time, call for caution when using MTS for screening drugs modulating M2/M1 phenotype. A wide range of preselected M2/M1 subsets markers should be monitored throughout the drug screening to assess the functional phenotype of TAM subsets for a given model (i.e., MTS) at any given time, in order to optimally interpret the results. ii) MDMs embedded in MTS show plasticity: the M2/ M1 phenotype can be actively modulated by IFN\u03b3 stimulation, and anti-CD40 mAb and CSF1Ri treatment. While IFN\u03b3 stimulation twisted differentiation toward M1-like phenotype, consistent with its physiological role in activating and generating cytotoxic macrophages (Castro et al., 2018), anti-CD40 mAb and CSF1Ri treatment caused increased polarization toward M2-like, rather than M1-like phenotype, which was unexpected based on in vivo studies (Wiehagen et al., 2017). This effect is not totally paradox as unrecognized diversity of TAMs subsets in human tumors has recently emerged (Guerriero, 2018). For example, inconsistencies of patterns in M1/M2 macrophage phenotypes in non-treated human tumors (Chevrier et al., 2017; Lavin et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2022) in human tumors from chemo and immunotherapy responders (Bi et al., 2021; Hu et al.; A; Mantovani et al., 2017) and similar 3D macrophage-cancer cell in vitro models (Madsen et al., 2021). Single-cell mapping of the breast tumor microenvironment revealed the expression of pro-tumor M2-and anti-tumor M1-associated genes often occurred within the same cells, demonstrating that M1 and M2 states are not mutually exclusive as originally proposed (Azizi et al., 2018). Strikingly, when exposed to CSF1Ri and anti-CD40 mAb macrophages co-cultured with cancer cells under 2D conditions, showed a progressive increase of the M1-like phenotype. The reasons of this 3D vs. 2D discrepancy remains unclear at this point, but similar contrasting results between 2D and 3D settings and inconsistency on M2/M1 phenotype binary classification in response to CSF1R inhibition and/or CD40 activation or other anti-cancer drugs have been reported using different cancer cell lines. For example, these unexpected phenotypic effects of M1 polarizing compounds on TAMs are suggested to reflect past rather current signalling, and timing of drug administration should be taken into consideration when evaluating novel therapies (Helleberg Madsen et al., 2022).\nHetero-spheroids, comprising ovarian cancer and macrophages, treated with WNT inhibitor showed no reduction in M2-like phenotype marker. 3D differentiation and activation was similar in terms of gene expression to conventionally activated macrophages in 2D culture systems (Raghavan et al., 2019). Fibroblast-pancreatic tumor spheroids induced a M2-like phenotype on the monocytes after co-culture them (Kuen et al., 2017). A comparison/integration of the 2D/3D results may be needed to better understand the immuno-phenotype response to TAMs targeted therapies and its anti-cancer efficacy for a given in vitro model. Our observation on M1/M2 phenotype vs. efficacy of CSF1Ri and CD40 ligand combination treatments, raises question on the historical TAM phenotype-function relationship and call for caution on how to monitor these treatments. iii) MDMs embedded in MTS are functional: they blunted the short term anti-proliferative effect of trastuzumab on BT-474 cells, they produced TNF-\u03b1 in response to anti-CD40 mAb and CSF1Ri treatment and they impinged on BT-747 cell viability and cell cycle progression. These effects are aligned with expected results, and particularly, they demonstrate that despite the paradox effect of CSF1Ri and anti-CD40 mAb treatment in the immunophenotype, treated macrophages acquire antitumor activities. Taken together, we describe and functionally verify MTS model as useful preclinical tool for the evaluation of combined TAMstargeted therapies, that may be used to evaluate effects of novel TAM-targeting agents on breast cancer cell behavior and fate. In view of the presented results, however, close monitoring and care should be taken into consideration to interpret results in the specific context of the immune-tumor model and avoiding extrapolating conclusions to other systems that may behave differently.\nData availability statement\nThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
