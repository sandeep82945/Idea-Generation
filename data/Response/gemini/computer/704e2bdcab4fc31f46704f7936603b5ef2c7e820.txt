1. **Investigate the relationship between information gain and clinical outcomes.** 
This could be done by comparing the information gain obtained from rs-fMRI and t-fMRI data in patients with different neurological or psychiatric disorders to their clinical symptoms and treatment outcomes. This would help to determine whether information gain can be used as a biomarker for disease severity or treatment response.


2. **Explore the effects of different task conditions on information gain.** 
The current study only examined one task condition (ToM). Future studies could investigate how information gain varies across different task conditions, such as working memory, attention, or language processing. This would help to determine which task conditions are most effective for eliciting informative neural responses.


3. **Examine the effects of different data analysis methods on information gain.** 
The current study used a specific data analysis pipeline to preprocess the fMRI data and estimate effective connectivity parameters. Future studies could investigate how information gain is affected by different data analysis methods, such as different preprocessing techniques, different DCM models, or different methods for estimating effective connectivity parameters.


4. **Investigate the relationship between information gain and individual differences.** 
The current study only examined group-level data. Future studies could investigate how information gain varies across individuals, and whether individual differences in information gain are related to factors such as age, sex, or cognitive ability.


5. **Develop new methods for improving information gain in rs-fMRI data.** 
The current study found that information gain was lower in rs-fMRI data than in t-fMRI data. Future studies could investigate new methods for improving information gain in rs-fMRI data, such as using different experimental designs, different data analysis methods, or different machine learning algorithms.
