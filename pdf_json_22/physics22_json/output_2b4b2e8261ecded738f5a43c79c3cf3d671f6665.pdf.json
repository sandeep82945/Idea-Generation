    "abstractText": "In this paper we identify a new family of black holes and solitons that lead to the exact integration of scalar probes, even in the presence of a non-minimal coupling with the Ricci scalar which has a non-trivial profile. The backgrounds are planar and spherical black holes as well as solitons of SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) N = 4 gauged supergravity in four dimensions. On these geometries, we compute the spectrum of (quasi-)normal modes for the non-minimally coupled scalar field. We find that the equation for the radial dependence can be integrated in terms of hypergeometric functions leading to an exact expression for the frequencies. The solutions do not asymptote to a constant curvature spacetime, nevertheless the asymptotic region acquires an extra conformal Killing vector. For the black hole, the scalar probe is purely ingoing at the horizon, and requiring that the solutions lead to an extremum of the action principle we impose a Dirichlet boundary condition at infinity. Surprisingly, the quasinormal modes do not depend on the radius of the black hole, therefore this family of geometries can be interpreted as isospectral in what regards to the wave operator non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar. We find both purely damped modes, as well as exponentially growing unstable modes depending on the values of the non-minimal coupling parameter. For the solitons we show that the same integrability property is achieved separately in a non-supersymmetric solutions as well as for the supersymmetric one. Imposing regularity at the origin and a well defined extremum for the action principle we obtain the spectra that can also lead to purely oscillatory modes as well as to unstable scalar probes, depending on the values of the non-minimal coupling.",

            "text": "Quasinormal modes play a very important role both in astrophysical as well as in theoretical contexts. In the former, they dominate the ringdown dynamics of the final black hole obtained from the fusion of compact objects, and a direct measurement of the mode with the lowest damping helps obtaining the mass and angular momentum of the final object [1]. In the latter, black hole quasinormal modes, within the context of holography, allow for the computation of relaxation properties of the dual field theory living at the boundary of AdS [2, 3]. It is well-known that even for simple black holes, as for example for Schwarzschild-(A)dS the computation of quasinormal modes relies on numerical techniques. These techniques are fully reliable, notwithstanding there are particular interesting cases where the spectrum of quasinormal frequencies can be found analytically which are useful to explore the relaxation properties of perturbations outside a black hole in an exact manner as one modifies the parameters that define the background geometry. A partial list of such cases is given by [4]\u2013[16]. In this paper, we identify a new family of black holes and solitons that allow for the exact integration of non-minimally coupled scalar probes, in the context of SU (2)\u00d7 SU (2) N = 4 gauged supergravity in four dimensions. This theory, also known as the Freedman-Schwarz [17] model can be obtained from 10D supergravity compactified on S3 \u00d7 S3 [18, 19]. The action principle reads\nS= \u222b d4x \u221a \u2212g [ R\n4 \u2212 1 2\u2202\u00b5\u03c6\u2202 \u00b5\u03c6\u2212 12e 4\u03c6\u2202\u00b5a\u2202 \u00b5a+ e 2 A+e2B 8 e 2\u03c6\u2212 e \u22122\u03c6 4 ( Ai\u00b5\u03bdAi\u00b5\u03bd+Bi\u00b5\u03bdBi\u00b5\u03bd ) \u2212a4 \u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u221a \u2212g ( Ai\u00b5\u03bdA i \u03c1\u03c3+Bi\u00b5\u03bdBi\u03c1\u03c3 )] (1.1)\nand the axion field a can consistently be set to zero provided the following equation of Pontryagin densities for the SU (2) gauge fields holds\n\u00b5\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 ( Ai\u00b5\u03bdA i \u03c1\u03c3 +Bi\u00b5\u03bdBi\u03c1\u03c3 ) = 0 .

(1.3)\nIn this work we will focus on the computation of quasinormal modes of scalar probes on black holes of this theory as well as on the computation of normal frequencies of the same probe fields on the gravitational soliton recently constructed in [23], both in the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric cases. We will deal with solutions with vanishing axion field, and since the self-interaction of the dilaton does not have a local extremum, the solutions have an asymptotic structure that has less symmetry than a maximally symmetric spacetime, although we will see the emergence of an asymptotic conformal Killing vector."

(2.13)\nHere, as an avatar for the study of the stability of these black holes, we will consider a real scalar probe, coupled to the Ricci scalar in a non-minimal manner:\n\u03a6\u2212 \u03beR\u03a6 = 0 , (2.14)\non the background (2.1). Given the local isometries of the spacetime, the scalar probe admits a mode separation which is given by\n\u03a6 ( t, r, yi ) = Re (\u222b d\u03c9 \u2211 A e\u2212i\u03c9tH\u03c9,A (r)YA (y) ) , (2.15)\nwhere yi are the coordinates on the Euclidean manifold \u03a32 and Yk (y) are harmonic function on such manifold, which are labeled by the multi-index A. Concretely, for the spherically symmetric case the harmonic functions are standard spherical harmonics, namely A = {l,m} and they fulfil\n\u22072S2Yl,m = \u2212k 2Yl,m = \u2212l (l + 1)Yl,m , (2.16)\nwhile for the planar case, the harmonic functions are trivially given by plane waves of the form\nYA = Y~k = Ce \u2212i~k\u00b7~y , (2.17)\nwhich fulfil \u2207R2Y~k = \u2212k 2Y~k = \u2212 ( k21 + k22 ) Y~k . (2.18)\nHereafter, for brevity we introduce the notation H\u03c9,A (r) = H (r). Notice that since the Ricci scalar of the spacetime has a non-trivial radial profile\nR = 2\u03b3 \u2212 6\u03b1 r2 \u2212 2\u03b1r2+ r4 , (2.19)\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 1\nthe non-minimal coupling term in (2.14) cannot be seen as an effective mass term. In spite of this fact, we will show that the equation for the radial profile of the scalar probe H (r) can be solved in an exact manner in terms of hypergeometric functions. Introducing the separation (2.15) on the scalar field equation (2.14) as a probe field on the black hole metric (2.1), after performing the change of variables\nr = r+ (1\u2212 x)1/2 , (2.20)\nwhich maps the region of outer communication r \u2208 [r+,+\u221e[ to x \u2208 [0, 1[, leads to the following equation for the radial profile\nd2H (x) dx2 + 1 x dH (x) dx\n+ (\n\u03c92\n4\u03b12x2 (1\u2212 x)2 \u2212 k\n2\n4\u03b1x (1\u2212 x)2 \u2212 (\u03b1x\u2212 4\u03b1+ \u03b3) 2\u03b1x (1\u2212 x)2 \u03be\n) H (x) = 0 .\n(2.21) Remarkably, this equation admits a solution in terms of hypergeometric functions.

(2.30)\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 1\nThis implies that different modes will have polynomial asymptotic expansions at infinity in the radial coordinate, with an exponent that is frequency dependent. This is in contrast with the asymptotically flat case for which R (r) \u223c e\u00b1i\u03c9r, and with the asymptotically AdS case for which \u03b7\u00b1 = \u2206\u00b1 being independent of both the angular momentum k and the frequency \u03c9. Since in general \u03c9 \u2208 C, in order to understand the possible boundary conditions at infinity, we will require the action principle to attain an extremum on the family of solutions that are ingoing at the horizon. The action principle leading to (2.14) reads\nI = \u222b d4x \u221a \u2212g ( \u221212\u2207\u00b5\u03a6\u2207 \u00b5\u03a6\u2212 12\u03beR\u03a6 2 ) , (2.31)\nand its on-shell variation with respect to the scalar field leads to the boundary term \u03b4I = \u2212 \u222b M d4x \u221a \u2212g\u2207\u00b5 (\u2207\u00b5\u03a6\u03b4\u03a6) = \u2212 \u222b \u2202M d3x \u221a \u2212\u03b3n\u0302\u00b5\u2207\u00b5\u03a6\u03b4\u03a6 , (2.32)\nwhere \u03b3 is the determinant of the induced metric on the boundary, while n\u0302\u00b5 is its unit normal vector. The boundary is the union of the spatial surfaces at t = ti and t = tf , with the surface r = r0 with r0 \u2192\u221e. As usual, the contribution of the former vanish since we impose \u03b4\u03a6 (ti, r, y) = \u03b4\u03a6 (tf , r, y) = 0, while the latter leads to\n\u2212 lim r0\u2192\u221e r3\u2202rH\u03b4H|r=r0 = limr0\u2192\u221e \u03b7+A\n2 bh\nr2\u03b7+\u22122 + \u03b7\u2212B\n2 bh r2\u03b7\u2212\u22122 + AbhBbh (\u03b7+ + \u03b7\u2212) r\u03b7++\u03b7\u2212\u22122 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=r0 \u03b4C1 (2.33)\nOne can check that \u03b7+ + \u03b7\u2212 \u2212 2 vanishes. Notice also that\n2\u03b7\u00b1 \u2212 2 = \u00b1 \u221a \u03a5\u2212 \u03c9 2\n\u03b12 , (2.34)\nwith \u03a5 = (1 \u2212 6\u03be) + (2\u03b3\u03be+k 2)\n\u03b1 . The exponents of the radial coordinate r in (2.33), are such that Re (2\u03b7\u2212 \u2212 2) < 0 and Re (2\u03b7+ \u2212 2) > 0 on the whole complex \u03c9-plane, except on a subset of zero measure. One of such subsets, for \u03a5 > 0, is defined by B = { \u03c9 \u2208 R s.t. \u03c9 \u2265 |\u03b1| \u221a \u03a5 \u2228 \u03c9 \u2264 \u2212|\u03b1| \u221a \u03a5 } . If \u03c9 \u2208 B, the exponents in (2.33) are purely imaginary (or constants if the inequalities are saturated) and therefore lead to oscillations (constants) as r \u2192\u221e and in consequence, it is impossible to impose an asymptotic behavior leading to a real extremum of the action principle if \u03c9 \u2208 B. We should therefore remove such regions of the complex \u03c9-plane. In the complement of the region B, namely for \u03c9 \u2208 (C \u2212 B), in order to obtain a genuine extremum of the on-shell action principle on the ingoing solution at the horizon, we need to impose Bbh = 0. From the view point of the asymptotic expansion (2.27), this corresponds to a Dirichlet boundary condition. Considering the expression for Bbh in (2.29) we obtain the following two equations for the spectrum\na1 = 1 2 \u2212 i\u03c9 2\u03b1 \u2212 \u221a 2\u03be 2 +\n\u221a (1\u2212 6\u03be)\u03b12 + 2\u03be\u03b1\u03b3 + \u03b1k2 \u2212 \u03c92\n2\u03b1 = \u2212p with p = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,\n(2.35)\nb1 = 1 2 \u2212 i\u03c9 2\u03b1 + \u221a 2\u03be 2 +\n\u221a (1\u2212 6\u03be)\u03b12 + 2\u03be\u03b1\u03b3 + \u03b1k2 \u2212 \u03c92\n2\u03b1 = \u2212q with q = 0, 1, 2, . . . .\n(2.36)\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 1\nEquation (2.35) leads to the following purely imaginary spectrum\n\u03c9p = \u2212 ( (2\u03b3 \u2212 8\u03b1) \u03be + 2 \u221a 2\u03be (1 + 2p)\u03b1\u2212 4p (1 + p)\u03b1+ k2 ) ( 1 + 2p+ 21/2\u03be1/2 ) 4\u03be \u2212 2(1 + 2p)2 i , (2.37)\nwhich is a valid solution of (2.35) provided\n\u03bdp :=\n( 1\u2212 4\u03be + (2p+ 1)2 ) \u03b1+ 2\u03b3\u03be + k2 \u2212 2 (2p+ 1)\u03b1 \u221a 2\u03be\n4 ( 1 + 2p\u2212 \u221a 2\u03be ) \u03b1\n< 0 . (2.38)\nOn the other hand, equation (2.36) leads to the following set of frequencies\n\u03c9q = \u2212 ((2\u03b3 \u2212 8\u03b1)\u03be \u2212 2\n\u221a 2\u03be (1 + 2q)\u03b1\u2212 4q(1 + q)\u03b1+ k2)(1 + 2q \u2212 \u221a 2\u03be)\n4\u03be \u2212 2(1 + 2q)2 i , (2.39)\nwhich is instead a valid solution of (2.36) provided\n\u03bdq :=\n( 1\u2212 4\u03be + (2p+ 1)2 ) \u03b1+ 2\u03b3\u03be + k2 + 2 (2p+ 1)\u03b1 \u221a 2\u03be\n4 ( 1 + 2p+ \u221a 2\u03be ) \u03b1\n< 0 . (2.40)\nIt can be checked that both spectra (2.37) and (2.39), in the \u201cs-wave\u201d case (k2 = 0) lead purely imaginary frequencies with negative imaginary part. The conditions (2.38) and (2.40) restrict the values of the non-minimal coupling parameter that lead to non-trivial spectra. An exhaustive exploration of these spectra is beyond the scope of this work, nevertheless, for the spherically symmetric black holes, with k2 = l (l + 1) = 2 we find a range of values of the non-minimal coupling \u03be leading to unstable modes coming from the spectrum (2.37) when p = 0. Figure 1 depicts both Im (\u03c9p) and \u03bdp from (2.37) and (2.38), respectively for a certain range of the non-minimal coupling, showing the presence of valid modes with Im (\u03c9p) > 0, therefore unstable. Notice that there is a valid mode for which \u03c9 = 0, which can be interpreted as a static scalar cloud [21]. The existence of these static solutions are usually interpreted as smoking guns for the existence of a new branch of solutions in which the probe becomes fully backreacting (see e.g. [22]). Notice that in our case, the would-be static backreacting solution might be non-spherically symmetric since l = 1.\nWe can see from equations (2.38) and (2.40) that for a massless, minimally coupled scalar, namely for \u03be = 0, it is not possible to fulfill the boundary conditions and there are no quasinormal modes of such massless scalar probe fields on the black hole background. This situation is similar to what occurs for a massless scalar probe on the asymptotically locally flat, static black holes in New Massive Gravity [15]. In the present case, a non-vanishing value of the non-minimal coupling allows for non-trivial quasinormal modes, provided (2.38) and (2.40) are fulfilled. It is very interesting to notice that such quasinormal frequencies do not depend on the black hole mass M = M(r+), and therefore all the black holes in the family (2.1) for different values of r+ are isospectral in what regards the quasinormal modes of the non-minimally coupled scalars. Notice that this is the case both, in the spherically symmetric and planar cases recovered by setting \u03b3 = 1 and \u03b3 = 0, respectively.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 1\nIm\u03c9p\n\u03bdp 2 \u03be\nUnstable range\nSpherically symmetric black holes, l=1, p=0 mode\n1.22 1.23 1.24 1.25\n-0.2 -0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nFigure 1.

The allowed modes correspond to values of \u03be such that \u03bdp < 0. The modes with frequencies with positive imaginary part are unstable. In consequence, stability sets an upper bound on the value of the non-minimal coupling parameter.\nIt is also illuminating to rewrite the second order equation for the radial profile of the non-minimally coupled scalar probe in a Schroedinger-like form. This is achieved by introducing the tortoise coordinate r\u2217 for the metric (2.1)\nr\u2217 = 1 2\u03b1 ln ( r2 \u2212 r2+ ) \u2192 r = \u221a r2+ + e2\u03b1r\u2217 , (2.41)\nwhich maps r \u2208]r+,\u221e[ to the whole real line, i.e. r\u2217 \u2208]\u2212\u221e,+\u221e[. Notice that we have been able to explicitly solve r in terms of r\u2217, which is not possible for Schwarzschild black hole. Using this fact, we can obtain the potential of the Schroedinger-like equation explicitly in terms of r\u2217. Introducing\nF (r) = H (r) r , (2.42)\nleads to \u2212 d 2F\ndr2\u2217 + U (r\u2217)F = \u03c92F , (2.43)\nwith U (r\u2217) = \u03b1 [ r2+ ( 2 (1\u2212 4\u03be)\u03b1+ 2\u03b3\u03be + k2 ) e2\u03b1r\u2217 + e4\u03b1r\u2217 ( (1\u2212 6\u03be)\u03b1+ 2\u03b3\u03be + k2 )]( r2+ + e2\u03b1r\u2217\n)2 . (2.44)\nNotice that this potential always vanishes in the near horizon region, namely when r\u2217 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Even more, when \u03be = 0 as r\u2217 \u2192\u221e the potential approaches a positive constant and has a Heviside-like shape, being a monotonically increasing function of r\u2217. As mentioned above, for the minimally coupled case it is impossible to find quasinormal modes, which is consistent with the basic fact that Schroedinger equation on a Heviside potential cannot\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 1\nhave solutions that approach zero at x\u2192\u221e and that represent purely \u201coutgoing\u201d modes travelling towards the left as x\u2192 \u2212\u221e. In what follows we move to the problem of computing the spectrum for a nonminimally coupled scalar probe on the gravitational solitons recently constructed in [23] in N = 4 SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) gauged supergravity, both in the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric cases."

Again, the boundary term coming from the onshell variation of the action principle (2.31)\u2013(2.32) leads to a single contribution at infinity coming from the surface x = x0 \u2192 1.

In the remaining set Re (2\u03b4+ \u2212 1) > 0 and \u03b4+ + \u03b4\u2212 \u2212 1 = 0. Therefore, in order to make the boundary term to vanish when evaluated on-shell on the branch that is regular at the origin, we must impose\nA1 = \u0393 (\u03b31) \u0393 (\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b21) \u0393 (\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b11) \u0393 (\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b21) = 0 .

The panels show the spectra of stable and unstable modes of the non-minimally coupled scalar probe on the background of the non-supersymmetric soliton. Valid solutions for the quantization equation leading to the frequencies require \u03bdp < 0, therefore in both panels, to the left of the vertical black line, there are no allowed modes given our boundary conditions.\nNotice that this is actually a Dirichlet boundary condition as can be seen from (3.20). The spectrum is therefore obtained from\n\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b11 = \u221a (1\u2212 6\u03be + n2)\u03b1+ 4 (k2 \u2212 \u03c92) + \u221a \u03b1 ( 1 + |n| \u2212 \u221a 2\u03be )\n2 \u221a \u03b1\n= \u2212p , (3.27)\n\u03b31 \u2212 \u03b21 = \u221a (1\u2212 6\u03be + n2)\u03b1+ 4 (k2 \u2212 \u03c92) + \u221a \u03b1 ( 1 + |n|+ \u221a 2\u03be )\n2 \u221a \u03b1\n= \u2212q , (3.28)\nwith q and p in {0, 1, 2, . . .}. One can also check that the second quantization condition (3.28) cannot be fulfilled, nevertheless the quantization condition (3.27) leads to the spectrum\n\u03c9p = \u00b1 1 2\n\u221a 2\u03b1 (|n|+ 2p+ 1) \u221a 2\u03be + 4k2 \u2212 2 (|n| (1 + 2p) + 4\u03be + 2p (1 + p))\u03b1 , (3.29)\nwhich is a valid solution of (3.27) provided\n\u03bdns := |n|+ 1\u2212 \u221a 2\u03be + 2p < 0 . (3.30)\nAs in the case of the black hole, for the non-supersymmetric soliton requiring regularity at the origin and Dirichlet boundary condition at infinity leads to an eigenvalue problem with a void spectrum when \u03be = 0. Nevertheless, the presence of the non-minimal coupling leads to non-trivial probe modes. The spectrum of the scalar on the non-supersymmetric soliton can be of diverse nature. Depending on the values of the parameters, it could be void, purely oscillatory namely with real frequencies (3.29) or unstable. The different behavior can be seen as separated by thresholds in the value of the non-minimal coupling \u03be. Figure 2 shows two possible spectra."

Stable oscillatory behavior can be achieved provided one restricts the values of the non-minimal coupling."

            "text": "In this paper we have found that N = 4 SU (2)\u00d7 SU (2) gauged supergravity admits black holes an solitons with sufficiently simple geometry that allows to compute the spectrum of a non-minimal scalar probe in an exact manner. The spacetimes approach a background at infinity which is not maximally symmetric, but possesses and extra conformal Killing vector, which is due to the fact that the dilatonic potential of the theory does not have local extrema. As reported in [23] the solitonic geometries are smooth at the origin and can preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetries and can be obtained from the corresponding planar black holes via a double analytic continuation, as it is the case of the recently reported solitons in N = 2 gauged supergravity in four dimensions [24]. At the origin and in the near horizon region, the boundary conditions are clear and are given by regularity and purely ingoing modes, respectively. Due to the non-trivial geometry at infinity, the behavior of the scalar probe in the asymptotic region is given by powers of the radial coordinate which depend on the frequencies. In order to select a consistent boundary condition at infinity we impose that the on-shell variation of the action functionals must vanish. This leads to a Dirichlet boundary condition and allows to write the spectra in a closed form. For the massless scalar probe it is impossible to fulfil these boundary conditions. For the black holes, this is consistent with the fact that the effective Schroedinger-like potential controlling the radial dependence of the scalar probe in terms of the tortoise coordinate, has a Heaviside function shape. Including a non-minimal coupling allows for a non-trivial spectrum which surprisingly, in the case of the black hole, does not depend on the value of the mass of the spacetime. Therefore all these geometries are isospectral in what regards to the non-minimally coupled wave operator. Given the integrability properties of this potential it will be interesting to compare our results with the recently reported potentials coming from a geometric approach to spectral theory in connection with SU (2) Seiberg-Witten theory with fundamental hypermultiplets (see section 2 of [25]). Such potentials are also given in terms of ratios of linear combinations of exponentials, and the technique elaborates on the previous work [26] (see also the recent [27] and [28]).\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 7 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 1\nStability of the modes is achieved for a certain range of non-minimal couplings, above which one finds modes that are exponentially growing in time, and that are in consequence unstable. The stable and unstable regimes are separated by solutions to the boundary eigenvalue problem which are time independent. These solutions have the same properties as the scalar clouds found in [21] which from the point of view of the fully backreacting theory are branching spacetimes to a new family of solutions (see e.g. [22]).\nWe have been able to solve in a closed form the non-minimally coupled scalar probe on a family of black holes and solitons of the Freedman-Schwarz model, even in the case of 1/4-BPS geometries. Such scalar probe goes beyond the field content of the theory, and it would be interesting to see whether some of the exact results we have obtained here, are also present in the context of gravitational perturbation theory considering only the fields that lead to the supersymetric model even if one has to rely on numerical or perturbative methods. We expect to report along these lines in the near future."
