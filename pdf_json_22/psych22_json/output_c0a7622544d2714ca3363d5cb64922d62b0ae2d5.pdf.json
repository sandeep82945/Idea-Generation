The secondary objective was to assess factors that may be related with risk of orthorexia nervosa (ON).\nMethods: Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted on March-to-June 2021 for ORTO-15) and April 2022 (ORTO-R). ORTO questionnaires were translated into Chinese using the forward\u2013backward\u2013forward method. Exploratory factor analysis, discriminant validity and con rmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to examine the construct validity of the assessment questionnaires. The internal consistency was assessed by using the Cronbach alpha coe cient and the test-retest reliability. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to explore potential impact factors related with ON scores.\nResults: Totally, 1289 and1084 eligible participants were included for the study of ORTO-15 and ORTO-R, with the mean age of 20.9\u00b12.0 years and 21.0\u00b12.3 years. The internal consistency of Chinese ORTO-15 scale and ORTO-R scale were both satisfactory (\u03b1=0.79, ICC=0.79; \u03b1=0.77, ICC=0.82). A two-factor solution of ORTO-R was characterized by acceptable goodness-of- t, whereas the three-factor solution of ORTO-15 showed relatively poor t. Multivariate linear regression indicated that physical activities and mental disorders were positively associated with ON risk assessed by both ORTO-R and ORTO-15.\nConclusion: The Chinese ORTO-R scale were a more reliable tool to screen for ON tendencies than the Chinese version of ORTO-15. Mental disorders and physical activities might be associated with the increased ON risk.\nLevel of evidence Level V (descriptive cross-sectional study).\n1 Introduction Orthorexia nervosa (ON), rst coined by Steven Bratman in 1997, refers to a excessive obsession for healthy food [1]. To satisfy a desire to attain optimum health, individuals with ON often have an extreme style of eating. Orthorexic individuals highly focus on quality (e.g., taste or enjoyment), not the quantity, of food, which re ected in meal preparation and consumption, may lead to restrictive diets even undernourishment and poor quality of life [2\u20134]. ON always accompanied by mental and social consequence. Psychologically, these individuals will suffer guilt and frustration strongly when they have eating transgressions. Those at high risk of ON may loss of relationships due to their excessive pursuit of food purity[4].\nTo screening and evaluation of orthorexia symptoms, the ORTO-15 questionnaire was rst designed by Donini et al. [5] on the basis of the Bratman Orthorexia Test (BOT) and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in Italy. Subsequently, ORTO-15 has been translated to various languages including French [6], Spanish [2], German [7], Greek [8], Arabic [9], and applied in both clinical and non-clinical populations at present [10, 11]. The prevalence of ON has been reported as 74.5% among medical\nPage 4/21\nstudents in Liban et al. [12], 28.3% among Polish students [13], and 49.5% among America dieticians [14]. The varied prevalence and unstable factorial structure of ORTO-15 lead to increasingly criticization. To overcome these limitations, Rogoza and Donini [15] re ned the original scale recently, providing a new scale-ORTO-R, which contain six best items from ORTO-15.\nFurthermore, few studies have assessed the potential risk factors that associated with ON. Souheil Hallit et al. [16] reported that ON was positively associated with lifestyle habits, namely higher alcohol use disorder, cigarette, and waterpipe dependence. A negative correlation was observed between body dissatisfaction and ON risk among Arabic population [9].\nPrevious related studies were all performed in Europe and north America in respect of discussing the ON diagnostic criteria, validating the assessment tools, determining the prevalence, etc. [17], and few data in Asian, China in particular, whom thought to have different cultural customs and dietary habits. To date, the validation and adaptation of the ORTO questionnaires including ORTO-15 and ORTO-R in Chinese population was completely blank.\nThus, the aim of the current study is to develop Chinese versions of the ORTO questionnaires (ORTO-15 and ORTO-R), examine their validity and reliability and compare these scales. Additionally, we also explored the potential factors related with ON risk.\n2 Method\n2.1 Instrument"

            "heading": "2.1.1 ORTO-15",
            "text": "The ORTO-15 is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 15 multiple-choice items for the diagnosis of ON, which was Italy version initially. It is a tool developing and improving on the basis of presenting model used by Bratman et al [5]. Some items from Bratman\u2019s test (1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10) were preserved after re ned and polished the verbal expression. A cut-off of 40 was suggested to a best predictive value for ON according to author of original version of the scale, which scores below the cut-off value indicate ON related behavior and the higher the score, the more \u201chealthier\u201d the subject [5]. 2.1.2 ORTO-R The ORTO-R questionnaire comprises 6 items identi ed from ORTO-15 as the best markers of ON, and it aims at providing a stable factorial structure [15]. The items were scored on a ve-point Likert scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often, and always) ranging from 1 to 5. Higher total scores indicate more ON tendencies. Different with ORTO-15, this instrument doesn\u2019t have a threshold value for the diagnosis of ON. Moreover, the scale is not recommended assessing the prevalence of ON according to the purpose of development of the questionnaire.\nPage 5/21\n2.2 Development of Chinese version of ORTO questionnaires Translation was rst conducted by a professor of nutrition, English professionals and panel members. The original scale was translated from English into Chinese, that is Forward translation. Then the instrument was translated back to English by foreigners who were uent in Chinese, English professionals and other panel members, which translators were blinded to the original English questionnaire. The authors examined both the wording of the English and Chinese versions and compared with the original English instrument, aiming to identify ambiguities and reconcile inconsistencies. Finally, a pilot study was conducted with a small convenience sample to ensure item comprehensibility of the nal version questionnaires[9, 18]. The translation version of ORTO-R and ORTO15 in Chinese language were given in Supplementary Table\u00a01 and Supplementary Table\u00a02. 2.3 Procedure One cross-sectional survey for validating the ORTO-15 scale was conducted between March and June 2021 and another survey was carried out in April 2022 for additional validation of the ORTO-R scale. Participants of these two surveys were college students recruited from universities in different regions of China, mainly including: Jinan University in Guangdong Province, ZunYi Medical University in Guizhou Province and Hainan Medical University in Hainan Province. A Chinese questionnaire was designed to complete and submit willingly by students at different faculties. The members of the survey panel distributed the QR code of the questionnaire to the college students possessing a cell phone through the social platform (mainly WeChat and TenCent QQ), and then the students scanned the code to ll out the questionnaire voluntarily. There was no missing data since answer to every question was mandatory in our electronic questionnaire.\nThe questionnaire was divided into two parts: the rst part investigated the individual information, which comprised sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, grade, major, height, weight, and monthly living expenses), lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol drinking, tea drinking and coffee drinking), physical activity, satis ed with weight and gure, a history of mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression or attention de cit and hyperactive disorder (ADHD)) and dietary habits. The body mass index (BMI) is equal to weight (kg) divided by the square of the height (m). The second part included the Chinese version ORTO-15 or ORTO-R scale. At the end of the questionnaire, there is a question concerning the subject\u2019s mobile phone number in order to the re-measure procedure after 2 weeks which could be answered voluntarily.\nFor the ORTO-15 scale, a total of 1323 college students completed the online-survey. 32 students were excluded due to illogical answers such as age<16 years or >30 years (n=11), BMI<15 kg/m2 or >40 kg/m2 (n=5) and time to ll out the questionnaire was too short (<60 s)(n=16). Finally, 1289 students included for ORTO-15 scale, of which 38 students were successfully contacted for the purpose of retesting 2 weeks later. Then, 1096 college students recruited for the ORTO-R scale. Those who age<16 years or >30 years\nPage 6/21\n(n = 10) and BMI<15 kg/m2 or >40 kg/m2 (n = 2) were excluded, remaining1084 students included in the nal analysis. The test-retest procedure was administered to 48 students. 2.4 Statistical analysis The continuous variables were expressed as mean (SD), whereas categorical variables were presented as percentage. To compare differences between groups, t-tests were used for the continuous variables and Chi square tests were used for the categorical variables. We also computed skewness and kurtosis of each item of ORTO questionnaires to examine normality of distribution.\nTo con rm the construct validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and con rmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used for ORTO questionnaires. The EFA exploring the factorial structure was carried out with the signi cant of the Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity (p \u2264 0.05) as well as the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index \u2265 0.70. CFA using maximum likelihood estimation was constructed to evaluate the factorial structure. The comparative t index (CFI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) were used to assess the t of the CFA model. RMSEA was estimated by the square root of the estimated discrepancy due to approximation per degree of freedom, which measured the approximate t in the population [19]. CFI values \u2265 0.90 and RMSEA values of 0.08 or less indicate a good t of the model [15]. SRMR was an overall badness-of- t measure through the tted residuals, in other words, the lower the SRMR represents the lower residuals and the better model t [19]. SRMR less than 0.08 indicating acceptable t and the closer to zero, the better the t [20, 21].\nThe reliability of the Chinese version of ORTO questionnaires was evaluated using internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The internal consistency was measured by the Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coe cient. Testretest reliability was measured by the intra-class correlation (ICC) and its 95% con dent interval. The time interval between test and retest was 2 weeks. Both these two indices of internal consistency greater than 0.6/0.7 indicates acceptable/good reliability [21].\nFor the evaluation of the potential impact factors on ON risk, univariate and multiple linear regression analysis was performed. We assumed that the sociodemographic characteristics of participants may the potential impact factors and regard as independent variables in the following analyses, and then the total scores of ORTO-15 or ORTO-R were taken as dependent variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the potential risk factors on the ON risk assessed by ORTO-15.\nAll analyses were performed using the SPSS software version 22.0 and R software version 4.0.2 (packages foreign, psych and lavaan). P<0.05 was considered statistically signi cant.\n3 Results\n3.1 Sociodemographic characteristics of the participants The sociodemographic characteristics of the participants were shown in Table\u00a01. 1289 participants (37.9% females; 20.9 \u00b1 2.0 years) for ORTO-15 and 1084 participants (68.1% females; 21.0 \u00b1 2.3 years) for\nPage 7/21\nORTO-R were included in the nal analysis. The prevalence of ON assessed by ORTO-15 was 46.7%. Compared the participants in ORTO-15 group, those in the ORTO-R group were more likely to be older, had higher BMI, less monthly living expense and diet preference, and had a higher proportion of female, freshman, medical students, coffee drinkers, and practicing sport activities (all P <0.05) (Table\u00a01).

Skewness and Kurtosis were considered normally distributed usually when the values ranged from \u2212 2 to +2 [22]. 3.2 Construct validity analysis The EFA was applied for the Chinese version of ORTO-15 and ORTO-R. The Bartlett test of sphericity was signi cant (\u03c72 = 3933.83, P < 0.001; \u03c72 = 1637.14; P<0.001), and the KMO index was 0.84 and 0.76, indicating that the data were suitable for EFA. The principal component analysis showed a three-factor structure of ORTO-15 and a two-factor structure of ORTO-R. The factor loadings of EFA of the two questionnaires were presented in supplementary table 5 and supplementary table 6.\nThe eigen value of the second factor of ORTO-R was less than 1(Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). Thus, a onefactor model and a two-factor model were retained. CFA was run to con rm the factorial structure. The results revealed a poor t of all models except the two-factor ORTO-R model, which have a reasonable t (\u03c72 = 39.43; P<0.001; CFI = 0.949; RMSEA = 0.085; SRMR = 0.051) (Table\u00a02).

This study translated ORTO-15 and ORTO-R into Chinese and validated and compared the Chinese version scales among Chinese college students. Our ndings suggested that the reliability of Chinese version of ORTO-15 and ORTO-R was acceptable. Previous related study showed various Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 of ORTO-15 scale, ranging from 0.14 [23] to 0.82 [24]. Additionally, the Cronbach \u03b1 coe cient of Arabic version ORTO-R was 0.78 and 0.76, respectively [25, 26]. The Greek version and Turkish version using the omega coe cient was 0.65 and 0.72, respectively [25, 27]. The Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 were 0.79 and 0.77 of ORTO15 and ORTO-R in the current study, similar to previous studies [12, 13, 28], which indicates that a satisfactory internal consistency of the instrument.\nThe exploratory factor analytic ndings of this study produced a three-factor solution for ORTO-15, which consistent with the original version [5] and other studies [2, 9]. As for ORTO-R, the EFA yielded a two-factor structure in the Chinese version of ORTO-R. A one-dimentional measurement model of the ORTO-R tting the data well were provided by Rogoza and Donini initially [25]. Subsequently, the Greek version of ORTOR replicated successfully the ndings proposed by Rogoza and Donini [25]. Furthermore, the ORTO-R in the Turkish language conducted by Yargic et al had a comparable result [27], whereas Hallit et al. [26] suggested that a two-factor solution in the Arabic version of ORTO-R.\nWe evaluated the rate of ON risk among college students by ORTO-15, which was 46.7%, whereas this prevalence ranged from 28.3% to 74.5% by other studies [13, 28, 29], which may be caused by the limitation of ORTO-15 test relating to distinguish whether the ON symptoms were pathological, thus leading to false positive results. Furthermore, the difference of the prevalence rate was owing to the sample characteristics [28]. For example, women, athletics and medical physicians were high-risk groups compared to the general population. Those people are usually attentive and cautious [30]. Undergraduates were at high risk likewise because body dissatisfaction and dieting for weight loss were prevalent among them [31].\nResults from CFA of ORTO-15 and ORTO-R revealed that all the ORTO-15 models in our study failed to provide a good t since the t indexes (CFI, RMSEA and SRMR) apparently higher or lower than the criteria, indicating the Chinese version of ORTO-15 has an unstable factorial structure. Since the poor factorial structure in many different country studies, researchers had to remove some items to improve the stability of ORTO-15, therefore, the orthorexic thoughts and behaviours may not be fully evaluated. In addition, there were no generic version of ORTO-15 between different countries because each of the national versions retained different items. Thus, it seemed impossible to make cross-cultural comparisons [15]. On the other hand, these issues were expected to be addressed with the development of the promising ORTO-R tool. In our study, only the two-factor ORTO-R model had a satisfactory goodness-of- t out of all models, which is similar to the factorial structure of Arabic version [26]. The ORTO-R also had an adequate internal reliability (\u03b1 = 0.77, ICC = 0.82). As a result, the two-factor ORTO-R may be a more suitable tool to screen ON tendency for Chinese population. We also explored potential factors related with ON risk. Our ndings showed that physical activities and mental disorders were\nPage 16/21\nrelated to ON risk assessed by both ORTO-15 and ORTO-R, suggesting that these two variables considerably might be the risk factors of ON.\nChinese people who engage in physical activities were more likely to have orthorexic tendency, which were in accordance with previous studies showing that sport activities played a signi cant role in ON [32]. Malmborg J et al. [33] compared the differences in the frequency of ON either in exercise science students or in business students, and concluded that exercise science students has a greater extent of ON than business students. Also, Clifford et al. [34] found that students undertaking \u2265 10 h per week of physical activity has lower scores than those \u2264 10 h per week. Under the circumstance that striving to reach the healthy nutrition, the motivation of frequent physical activities should be considered. Individuals do sports to improve health, but this can develop to exercise addiction with obsessive features such as calculating calories and guilt over skipping training [27].\nWe also found that people with depression, anxiety or ADHD were more likely to have the tendency of ON. This result was in agree with previous literatures, where participants scored lower in ORTO-15 reported that more participants were ever diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder [8, 35]. Our ndings reinforced the evidence suggested the ON should be categorized into the scope of mental disease. However, He et al. [36] concluded that there was no association between ON and mental health impairment. The study was conducted among the elderly in East Asia using the instrument of Dusseldorf Orthorexia Scale (DOS). In their opinion, individuals with more ON symptoms had similar or less mental distress compared with those not [36]. The association of nature, strength, and provisionality between ON and mental illness should be validated with more studies [37].\nIn conclusion, the current study updated a new language version of ORTO questionnaires. We found a two-factor structure of the ORTO-R with an acceptable t, indicated the Chinese version of ORTO-R might be reliable to assess ON risk in a China sample. Physical activities and mental disorders were the most likely contributing factors for ON risk. Further studies could be performed among various population and countries to con rm our results.\nStrengths and limitations\nTo our knowledge, this is the rst study to validate the scales of ORTO among Chinese college students. However, several limitations of the current study should be taken into consider. First, the data were obtained through self-report; hence, information bias might inevitable during the data collection. Second, the target population of this investigation was university students of China, so the results cannot be generalized to the whole population. Furthermore, as mentioned in the study conducted by Fernandez et al. [38], from a nutritional point of view, the youth is an especially vulnerable group and they will undergo a critical period for changing and establishing their lifestyle habits and food consumption during university. Moreover, subjects who voluntarily participate in this study may concerned more about dietary health, resulting in overestimated risk in the present study.\nWhat is already known on this subject?\nPage 17/21\nORTO-15 is one of the most common instruments used for measuring orthorexic tendencies. Existing studies translated it from English to various languages and applied in many countries. However, several items of the ORTO-15 have been removed due to cultural differences between countries, there is no commonly version of ORTO-15 yet. Therefore, based on ORTO-15, the ORTO-R was developed as a new promising tool with the purpose of assessing orthorexic behavior better, whereas no study has validated the ORTO-R.\nWhat this study adds?\nTo our knowledge, this is the rst study to validate the scales of ORTO among Chinese college students. We found the Chinese versions of ORTO-R scale was reliable to assess ON among Chinese students, which was useful to make intensive studies of ON. The study also found physical activities and mental disorders were related with increased ON risk.\nAbbreviations AN, anorexia nervosa ADHD, attention de cit and hyperactive disorder BMI, body mass index BOT, Bratman Orthorexia Test DOS, Dusseldorf Orthorexia Scale DSM-5, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Disorders ICD-10, International Statistical Classi cation of Diseases and Related Health Problems MMPI, Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ON, orthorexia nervosa OCD, obsessive compulsive disorders.\nDeclarations Fundings\nThis study was supported by the Medical Scienti c Research Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (No. A2020582) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81602853).\nCon icts of interests\u00a0\nThe authors declare that they have no other con icts of interest to disclose.\nAuthorship\nThe authors\u2019 contributions are as follows: F.-F.Z conceived and designed the study; W.-L.L analyzed data and wrote the initial and nal drafts of the manuscript; W.-L.L, S.-X.T, R.-Q.OY, Y.-F.C., J.-R.M, C.C., Y.-J.M.,\nPage 18/21\nS.-W.Z, L.Z., P.X., W.-Z.N., L.-Y.L., L.-N.F., Y.-M.L, X.-L.Y, Z.-Y.W, F.D., Q.-F.P., A.-Y.J., J.-M.H., W.-T.C., J.L., Y.-B.Y. conducted the research and collected data; all the authors read and approved the nal manuscript.\nData Availability\nThe data that support the ndings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nEthical Approval\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of School of Medicine, Jinan university (JNUKY-2021041).
