Each cell type or biofluid is characterized by unique metabolic signature, which can be altered in pathophysiological conditions (Cacciatore and Loda, 2015; Cacciatore et al., 2021). Metabolic concentrations are regulated by complex biological pathways, of which enzymes are key modulators. Despite their known specificity, many enzymes are reported to have promiscuous activity and catalyze reactions of molecules that are chemically like their specific substrates (Piedrafita et al., 2015). Pathological events can also change the concentration of specific molecule classes in non-enzymatic manner, such as through mechanical occlusion (Elebo et al., 2021). During both biological activity and preanalytical procedures, nonenzymatic reactions can also muddle the structure and concentration of metabolites that either belong to the same chemical class or harbor specific functional groups (Cacciatore et al., 2013, 2017a).\nMetabolites with a similar chemical structure tend to share similar properties and biological activity (Ekaney et al., 2021; Menikarachchi et al., 2013).\nMost conventional computational tools for metabolite mapping and enrichment analysis rely primarily on a wide variety of curated pathway databases (Banimfreg et al., 2022; Pang et al., 2021). Unfortunately, the coverage of currently annotated pathways in the human metabolic network remains poor. Recently, chemical similarity has been used to extend known metabolic pathways to include unreported metabolites (Grapov et al., 2015; Pertusi et al. 2015).\nThe first study that applied structural similarity to classifying Escherichia coli metabolome into chemically and functionally related groups was reported by Nobeli et al. (2003). After this, there have been many attempts to develop computer aided tools that integrate chemical structure into metabolite analysis and visualization such as MetaMapR (Grapov et al., 2015) and ChemRICH (Barupal and Fiehn, 2017). However, conventional algorithms fail to identify local clusters of metabolites with similar structures (Andronov et al., 2021). Thus, there is still an unmet\nVC The Author(s) 2023.

MetChem is designed to provide metabolomics researchers with a user-friendly pipeline able to investigate features in metabolic modules defined by their structural similarity. MetChem is also equipped with different functions to provide identified clusters with information from the Human Metabolite Database (HMDB) (Wishart et al., 2022)."

This function converts SMILES into molecular fingerprints, encoding their structural characteristics as a vector. The distance between two metabolites is calculated using a distance method such as Tanimoto to produce a dissimilarity matrix (Fig. 1A). This dissimilarity matrix is then converted into a multidimensional space (Fig. 1B) prior to being processed by KODAMA, using the homonym package (Cacciatore et al., 2017b). The output generated by KODAMA is a two-dimensional plot representing the \u2018chemical distances\u2019 between all metabolites (Fig. 1C). Metabolite hierarchical clustering is then built on the KODAMA output. Rousseeuw\u2019s Silhouette quality index (Rousseeuw, 1987) is used to calculate the optimal number of clusters.\nTo ensure the reproducibility of the results, the entire procedure is repeated (10 times as default) and average Rousseeuw\u2019s Silhouette quality index values are calculated (Fig. 1D)."

Recently, WGCNA has been also applied to metabolomic research (Mock et al., 2018). Akin to WGCNA, we have developed the Weighted Metabolite Chemical Similarity Analysis (WMCSA). In this pipeline, WMCSA is applied to a selected cluster of metabolites identified by the clusters.detection function (Fig. 2A). WMCSA is implemented in the homonym function WMCSA. This function summarizes metabolite concentrations in modules that are defined by metabolite chemical similarity. Modules are generated by cutting all possible different branches of the hierarchical clustering performed on the selected class of metabolites.

The dataset contains the metabolic profiles from ventral prostate tissues of mice that overexpress the human c-MYC transgene (MYC) in the prostate epithelium and wild-type littermates (WT). Mice were fed either a high fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal from fat; lard-rich in saturated fat) or a control diet (CTD; 10% kcal from fat) for 9 weeks. The dataset includes six replicates for each group (i.e. WT_CTD, MYC_CTD, WT_HFD and MYC_HFD). A total of 398 metabolites were associated with their own SMILES representation. In this dataset, eight different chemical classes were identified (Fig. 1C and D). A WMCSA was performed in one selected chemical class as representative example to generate module representation (Fig. 2B). Statistically significant different modules between MYC and WT were identified. The module 12 was chosen for further inspection. The module consists of the metabolites anserine, carnosine, cyclo(his-pro), N-acetylhistidine and N-acetyl-1-methylhistidine, which are characterized by the presence of common significant substituents, such as imidazolyl carboxylic acid. Related enzymes were also identified (Fig. 2C). Although, the conversion of methylhistidine from anserine and carnosine has been described as indication of muscle breakdown (Hsieh et al., 2022), the relation with cyclo(his-pro), N-acetylhistidine and N-\nacetyl-1-methylhistidine has not been characterized yet, which opens opportunities for further investigation. We observed that reduced concentration of these metabolites was associated with the overexpression of MYC, a well-known oncogene involved in the regulation of the glycolysis (Dang, 2012). Since carnosine exerts metabolismdependent effects, including potential inhibition of glycolysis (Gaunitz and Hipkiss, 2012), we speculate that the metabolic effects of carnosine reduction in the MYC-transformed prostate may also involve other imidazolyl carboxylic acids of the module, which is warrant further investigation."
