            "text": "Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease that was estimated to affect 5.4 million victims with up to 138,000 deaths around the world [1]. Snakebite envenoming has been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the highest priority neglected tropical diseases since 2017. The WHO has set its goal to halve the global morbidity and mortality burden of snakebite by 2030 [2, 3].\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is an economic union comprising of\nten member countries including Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam with over 600 million people\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010775 September 28, 2022 2 / 17\nFunding: This work is supported by the Wellcome Trust [218539/Z/19/Z] to CP, AKI, IO, SAZA, ST, and NC (https://wellcome.org). This research project is supported by the Second Century Fund (C2F), Chulalongkorn University to CP and ST (https://c2f.chula.ac.th). The funders had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, writing of the report, or the decision to submit for publication.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n[4]. ASEAN is one of the tropical regions with disproportionately high incidence of snakebite. Previous estimation of snakebite in 2007 found that approximately 234,000\u20131,410,000 people were bitten by snake annually resulting in 700\u201318,000 deaths in eight ASEAN countries, except Brunei Darussalam and Singapore where snakebite rarely occurred and/or exact data were lacking [1].\nOur previous study found that there are five domestic antivenom manufacturers in ASEAN,\nincluding Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Up to 290,000 vials of antivenoms were annually produced by these manufacturers which could treat approximately 42,000 victims with snakebite envenoming. However, these produced antivenoms were not enough to treat all victims indicated for antivenom treatment. Besides, the total demand of antivenoms in ASEAN was not estimated [5]. This warranted a comprehensive research on burden of snakebite in the region to quantitatively highlight the neglected problem.\nUnderstanding the current economic and disease burden of snakebite is crucial for devel-\noping evidence-informed strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality of snakebite victims to pursue the goal set by the WHO [3]. Studies have been conducted to estimate the annual national economic and disease burden of snakebite in regions where snakebites are prevalent such as Africa [6\u201312]. Nevertheless, there was no such information in ASEAN countries. Thus, we aimed to estimate economic and disease burden of snakebite in ASEAN using a decision analytic modelling approach."

These seven countries were selected based on the evidence of documented snakebite in the country and availability of local key informants to gather more insights on the situation of snakebite which were not publicly available. Brunei Darussalam and Singapore were not included because snakebite rarely occurred and/or exact data were lacking [1]. Cambodia was not included due to lack of recently published literature on snakebite and key informants that hindered the proper estimation of the burden of snakebite in Cambodia.\nAnnual number of snakebite victims in the region were estimated using a decision analytic\nmodel which incorporated treatment seeking behavior to include victims who were not treated in healthcare facilities. Economic burden was estimated from the societal perspective to estimate lifetime costs of snakebite victims which occurred from snakebite episode to long-term consequences. To enable comparison of economic burden between countries, all costs of snakebite were presented as annual national total costs for each country in 2019 USD and converted to the percentage of country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. Disease burden of snakebite was estimated and quantified as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to snakebite in one year in each country."

Second, snakebite victims were accompanied by relatives or family members who took care of them during snakebite episode. Third, antivenom was given to reverse snakebite envenoming and save lives. However, there was no data on the efficacy or effectiveness of antivenom in ASEAN countries. Thus, antivenom effectiveness was based on a study in Nigeria which found a 2.33 fold (95% confidence interval [CI]; 1.26\u20134.06) increase risk of death in antivenom indicated victims who were not treated with antivenom compared to those treated with antivenom [40]. This relative risk was used to calculate the probability of death due to snakebite in those who were not treated with geographically appropriate antivenoms.\nTotal number of snakebite victims\nEstimating the total number of snakebite victims occurring in one year in each country was done by applying the country-specific input parameters into the model. The estimated snakebite victims were categorized by their gender, age groups, treatment seeking behavior, indication for antivenom treatment, and disease consequences, i.e., deaths, alive without disabilities, and alive with disabilities."

Indirect costs included productivity losses during snakebite episode of victims and their relatives and productivity losses due to premature death. Productivity losses during snakebite episodes for victims and their relatives were estimated by multiplying length of stay to the daily income. Productivity losses due to premature death were estimated by multiplying the remaining working years from the age of death up to retirement age at 60 years to the GDP per capita. Productivity losses were not quantified for those who died after the age of 60.

PTSD could also occur following a snakebite without systemic envenoming. However, the incidence was unknown. Therefore, by applying a lower boundary level of the probability of PTSD following snakebite, it was estimated that 2% of snakebite victims without envenoming would have PTSD following snakebite. Estimation of economic burden of PTSD following snakebite is explained in S2 Appendix [65\u201367]. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulations for 1,000 times by randomly sampling on a distribution of all parameters to estimate a 95% credible interval (CrI) of the economic and disease burden of snakebite."

            "text": "To achieve the goal set by the WHO to halve burden of snakebite by 2030, countries should know their current economic and disease burden of snakebite to understand their current standpoint. To our understanding, this is the first study conducted to estimate the economic and disease burden of snakebite in Southeast Asia. The annual economic and disease burden of snakebite in seven ASEAN countries were estimated using a decision analytic model incorporating input parameters from various sources including published literature and local sources to estimate the burden of all snakebite victims regardless of their treatment seeking behavior.\nWe estimated that annually there were 242,648 snakebite victims (95%CrI 209,810\u2013\n291,023) of which 15,909 victims (95%CrI 7,592\u201333,949) were dead and 954 victims (95%CrI 383\u20131,797) were amputated. The estimated number of snakebite victims and deaths were comparable to the previous estimates in 2007 of approximately 234,000\u20131,410,000 snakebite victims and 700\u201318,000 deaths [1]. Annual disease burden of snakebite was estimated at 391,979 DALYs (95%CrI 187,261\u2013836,559). Total costs of snakebite were estimated at 2.5 billion USD (95%CrI 1.2\u20135.4 billion USD) which were equivalent to 0.09% (95%CrI 0.04\u20130.20%) of the region\u2019s GDP. The share of the estimated economic burden from snakebite of the country\u2019s GDP ranged from 0.001% in Malaysia to 0.443% in Lao PDR which were remarkably high compared to less than 0.001%. in Iran and Burkina Faso and 0.016% in Sri Lanka [6\u20139]. The estimated disease burden of snakebite of 391,979 DALYs in seven ASEAN countries (61 DALYs per 100,000 population) was low compared to the previous estimates of 319,874 DALYs in 16 Western African countries (approximately 93 DALYs per 100,000 population) [11] and 1,029,209 DALYs in 41 Sub-Saharan African countries (approximately 120 DALYs per 100,000 population) [10]. This could be partly explained by the differences in the incidence and mortality of snakebite and access to antivenom treatment. Compared to the disease burden of neglected tropical diseases in seven ASEAN countries that were estimated in the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study, snakebite was the second highest burden ranking below dengue (909,899 DALYs) (S3 Fig). The disease burdens of malaria (72,844 DALYs) and rabies (66,525 DALYs) were much lower than snakebite [68].\nIn Malaysia and Thailand,>90% of victims indicated for antivenom could access to it. In\ncontrast, remarkably lower proportions were demonstrated in Lao PDR, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, and Myanmar of which 4\u201364% antivenom indicated victims were treated with antivenoms. These victims either sought traditional healers or were treated in healthcare facilities but did not receive antivenom due to inadequate supply of antivenom. Consequently, most deaths from snakebite envenoming (99.9%) in ASEAN were from Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Lao PDR, and Myanmar which contributed to high economic and disease burden of premature death from snakebite envenoming. We found that more than 95% of the estimated economic and disease burden was attributed to premature deaths. Treating all snakebite victims who need antivenoms in these countries would save their lives which would result in a tremendous decrease in the burden of snakebite in ASEAN. However, increasing access to antivenom was not only about producing antivenoms but the whole surrounding supporting and management system especially the information system to inform decision making and logistics to efficiently deliver antivenoms even to the farthest healthcare facilities. We previously assessed the situation of snakebite in ASEAN and provided the potential opportunities\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010775 September 28, 2022 11 / 17\nto improve situation of snakebite in ASEAN to meet the WHO\u2019s target of halving snakebite mortality and morbidity by 2030. These potential opportunities included accurate estimation of antivenom demand, rigorous regulations of antivenom, strengthening the supply chain system, raising public awareness about the importance of treating snakebite envenoming by healthcare professionals, strengthening the health system to ensure appropriate snakebite management and rational use of antivenoms, and expanding collaboration of local and international stakeholders and funders [5].\nThere were few important limitations of this study worth mentioning. Firstly, Cambodia was not included in this study because we were not able to identify published literature and key informants that could be utilized to estimate the burden of snakebite in Cambodia. It is important to note that Cambodia is one of the countries that imported antivenoms from Thailand, indicating that there were snakebite victims in this country [5]. Secondly, consequences of snakebite included in the model and its sensitivity analysis were limited to death, amputation, and PTSD. Other disabilities such as blindness, malignant ulcers, and pregnancy loss were not included due to a lack of empirical evidence in ASEAN [13]. This warrants future studies in ASEAN to evaluate all relevant consequences and disabilities and associated costs of snakebite to allow better estimation of burden of snakebite. Lastly, there was no nation-wide community and hospital study to comprehensively collect the number of snakebite victims in some of the included countries. Hence, input parameters must be estimated based on nonnational studies, local data, and expert opinions, resulting in a wide range of the estimated economic and disease burden of snakebite in ASEAN. This is especially relevant in Lao PDR and Indonesia where snakebite incidences were very high and estimated by local experts. Nevertheless, our findings suggested that there was high burden of snakebite despite the availability of domestically produced antivenoms in the region. We emphasized the importance of funding research to perform a comprehensive data collection on epidemiological and economic burden of snakebite to eventually reveal the true burden of snakebite in ASEAN. These data will yield more accurate information on burden of snakebite to guide decision making in not only the ASEAN but also the WHO to develop global strategies to tackle the problem of snakebite."

            "text": "Annual production of 290,000 vials of antivenom in ASEAN were given to only 31% of victims who were indicated for antivenom treatment. Our estimates highlighted the high economic and disease burden of snakebite in ASEAN despite the availability of domestically produced antivenoms. Almost all of the estimated economic and disease burdens were attributed to premature deaths from snakebite envenoming which suggested that the remarkably high burden of snakebite could be averted, especially in countries where large proportions of victims who needed antivenom were not treated with geographically appropriate antivenoms. Strategies should be developed with the goal to improve health outcomes of snakebite victims. However, strategies used to achieve this goal are likely to be complex and different across countries depending on each country\u2019s context and situation such as accurate informatics, rigorous regulations of antivenoms, efficient supply chain, rational use of antivenoms, appropriate treatment seeking behaviors, and good governance to support a strong healthcare system."
