    "abstractText": "Early Life Stress (ELS) can critically influence brain development and future stress responses and thus represents an important risk factor for mental health and disease. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is discussed to be a key mediator of resilient vs. vulnerable adaptations and specifically, the NPY-Y2 receptor (Y2R) may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression due to its negative regulation of NPY-release. The present study addressed the hypotheses that ELS and adult stress (AS) affect the expression of hippocampal Y2R and that exposure to ELS induces an epigenetically mediated programming effect towards a consecutive stress exposure in adulthood. The specific aims were to investigate if (i) ELS or AS as single stressors induce changes in Y2 receptor gene expression in the hippocampus, (ii) the predicted Y2R changes are epigenetically mediated via promoter-specific DNA-methylation, (iii) the ELS-induced epigenetic changes exert a programming effect on Y2R gene expression changes in response to AS, and finally (iv) if the predicted alterations are sex-specific. Animals were assigned to the following experimental groups: (1) non-stressed controls (CON), (2) only ELS exposure (ELS), (3) only adult stress exposure (CON+AS), and (4) exposure to ELS followed by AS (ELS+AS). Using repeated maternal separation in mice as an ELS and swim stress as an AS we found that both stressors affected Y2R gene expression in the hippocampus of male mice but not in females. Specifically, upregulated expression was found in the CON+AS group. In addition, exposure to both stressors ELS+AS significantly reduced Y2R gene expression when compared to CON+AS. The changes in Y2R expression were paralleled by altered DNA-methylation patterns at the Y2R promoter, specifically, a decrease in mean DNA-methylation in the CON+AS males compared to the non-AS exposed groups and an increase in the ELS+AS males compared to the CON+AS males. Also, a strong negative correlation of mean DNA-methylation with Y2R expression was found. Detailed CpG-site-specific analysis",

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is discussed to be a key mediator of resilient vs. vulnerable adaptations and specifically, the NPY-Y2 receptor (Y2R) may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression due to its negative regulation of NPY-release. The present study addressed the hypotheses that ELS and adult stress (AS) affect the expression of hippocampal Y2R and that exposure to ELS induces an epigenetically mediated programming effect towards a consecutive stress exposure in adulthood. The specific aims were to investigate if (i) ELS or AS as single stressors induce changes in Y2 receptor gene expression in the hippocampus, (ii) the predicted Y2R changes are epigenetically mediated via promoter-specific DNA-methylation, (iii) the ELS-induced epigenetic changes exert a programming effect on Y2R gene expression changes in response to AS, and finally (iv) if the predicted alterations are sex-specific. Animals were assigned to the following experimental groups: (1) non-stressed controls (CON), (2) only ELS exposure (ELS), (3) only adult stress exposure (CON+AS), and (4) exposure to ELS followed by AS (ELS+AS). Using repeated maternal separation in mice as an ELS and swim stress as an AS we found that both stressors affected Y2R gene expression in the hippocampus of male mice but not in females. Specifically, upregulated expression was found in the CON+AS group. In addition, exposure to both stressors ELS+AS significantly reduced Y2R gene expression when compared to CON+AS. The changes in Y2R expression were paralleled by altered DNA-methylation patterns at the Y2R promoter, specifically, a decrease in mean DNA-methylation in the CON+AS males compared to the non-AS exposed groups and an increase in the ELS+AS males compared to the CON+AS males. Also, a strong negative correlation of mean DNA-methylation with Y2R expression was found.

            "text": "Early life stress (ELS) is a critical risk factor underlying the etiology of mental disorders since it critically affects the development of neuronal circuits in limbic and prefrontal cortical brain areas (Bock et al., 2014; Babenko et al., 2015; Burkholder et al., 2016; Birnie et al., 2020). Repeated maternal separation in rodents is a widely used experimental paradigm to investigate the behavioral, physiological, and cellular/molecular consequences of ELS (Groger et al., 2016). So far, the majority of studies have focused on the detrimental outcome of ELS and described the emergence of psychopathological behaviors including depressive-like behavioral symptoms (Dimatelis et al., 2016; Sadeghi et al., 2016; Tractenberg et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2017; Pena et al., 2019; Bachiller et al., 2020). However, there is increasing evidence that ELS can also induce adaptive neuronal and cellular changes that promote stress resilience and enhance the flexibility of behavioral adaptations to challenging encounters later in life (Zannas and West, 2014; McEwen, 2016; Santarelli et al., 2017; Agorastos et al., 2019; Hodes and Epperson, 2019). Furthermore, the analysis of sex-specific differences has not yet been addressed in much detail, although more recent literature reveals that the long-lasting consequences of ELS on the brain and behavior are sexdependent (Bonapersona et al., 2019).\nA more detailed mechanistic understanding of the longterm consequences of ELS and how ELS exposure may affect stress responses and behavior later in life can only be obtained by exposing individuals to multiple and also different types of stressors at different life spans (Orso et al., 2020). This led to the \u201ctwo-(or multiple) hit\u201d concept, which claims that early life adversities may exert a \u201cprogramming\u201d effect on the behavioral and on the cellular/molecular level and thereby increase or decrease stress sensitivity later in life (Lupien et al., 2009; Gruber et al., 2015; Lesse et al., 2017; Santarelli et al., 2017; Jaric et al., 2019). There is increasing evidence that specific epigenetic changes are underlying such programming effects induced by early life experiences (Bock et al., 2014; Groger et al., 2016). Epigenetic mechanisms are defined as alterations in gene expression levels that are not due to changes in the DNA sequence (Lacal and Ventura, 2018) and are considered the interface between early environmental influences and genetically programmed developmental processes in the brain. Thus, these mechanisms are also thought to play a crucial role in translating early adverse experiences into long-lasting gene expression changes that may underlie changes in stress-related behaviors and psychopathologies (Bock et al., 2014; Groger et al., 2016;\nAlexander et al., 2018; Alyamani and Murgatroyd, 2018; Li et al., 2020).\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY), one of the most abundant neuropeptides in several brain regions such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, is considered to be a key mediator in the development of vulnerability and resilience (Nahvi and Sabban, 2020). Besides other physiological functions such as regulating food intake, energy homeostasis, and circadian rhythms, there is evidence that NPY plays a complex role in the regulation of stress-affective behavior and stress resilience by suppressing the effects of stress-related neurotransmitters (Enman et al., 2015; Kautz et al., 2017; Hassan et al., 2019). In healthy subjects\u2019 plasma NPY levels have been shown to rise in response to stress, whereas in depressed individuals\u2019 plasma and CSF NPY levels are decreased when compared to healthy controls (Widerlov et al., 1988; Hashimoto et al., 1996; Nilsson et al., 1996; Heilig et al., 2004; Hou et al., 2006). Animal studies have shown that NPY knockout mice are more anxious and hippocampal or amygdala NPY overexpression renders animals less anxious (Bannon et al., 2000; Thorsell et al., 2000; Primeaux et al., 2005). The neuromodulatory effects of NPY are mediated by at least six G-protein coupled receptors, of which Y1, Y2, and Y5 are of the most important in behavioral studies. The functions and distribution of these receptors in the nervous system differ depending on brain regions (Duarte-Neves et al., 2016). In the mouse brain, the Y2 receptor (Y2R) shows a widespread distribution in cell bodies and nerve terminals, specifically in different hippocampal subfields, the amygdala, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, and hypothalamus (Stanic et al., 2006). The Y2R is a presynaptic autoreceptor that negatively regulates the release of NPY, and thus its stimulation can exert anxiogenic effects (Chen et al., 1997; Redrobe et al., 2002; Reichmann and Holzer, 2016; Nwokafor et al., 2020). There is increasing evidence that alterations in the expression of this receptor subtype may be associated with stress-related disorders such as major depression and PTSD (Treutlein et al., 2017; Stone et al., 2020).\nThe aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that ELS induces long-term changes in DNA-methylation specifically at Y2R promoter sites, resulting in changes in Y2R expression that represent a programming effect for stress susceptibility in adulthood. Using a repeated maternal separation protocol in mice as an ELS paradigm (Lesse et al., 2017; Kohler et al., 2019), we analyzed if (i) ELS affects Y2R expression in the hippocampus at adulthood, (ii) if the proposed Y2R changes are epigenetically regulated via promoter-specific DNA-methylation, and (iii) if these ELS-induced \u201cprogramming effects\u201d of Y2R expression interfere with changes in Y2R expression and\nFrontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 936979\nDNA-methylation in response to an adult stressor (forced swimming). In addition, we investigated if (iv) the stressinduced changes in Y2 receptor expression differ in the male and female hippocampus."

However, the neuronal and cellular mechanisms mediating and determining stress vulnerability or resilience are still poorly understood. There is increasing evidence that the neuropeptide Y, one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the brain with particularly high expression in the hippocampus and cortical areas, may function as an endogenous mediator of pathological or resilient adaptations after ELS (Dumont and Quirion, 2006; Enman et al., 2015; Kautz et al., 2017; Hassan et al., 2019). A negative regulator of NPY release is the presynaptic\nY2 receptor. Alterations in the expression of this receptor subtype are associated with stress-related disorders such as major depression and PTSD (Treutlein et al., 2017; Stone et al., 2020).\nIn the present study, we first focused on changes in the expression of the Y2 receptor gene in response to ELS and in response to AS. At the gene expression level, we found that ELS alone did not significantly change Y2 receptor gene expression in adult males and females. However, in rats, it was reported that the NPY-system is sensitive towards ELS since it was reported that NPY-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala was decreased after exposure to maternal separation stress (Jimenez-Vasquez et al., 2001; Miragaia et al., 2018). In contrast, we found that exposure only to AS increased Y2 receptor gene expression in male animals. Presynaptic Y2 receptors are negative regulators of NPY release, e.g., it was shown that deletion or blockade of Y2 receptor elevates NPY levels, which can exert antidepressant-like effects (Tschenett et al., 2003; Carvajal et al., 2006). Accordingly, the AS-induced upregulation of Y2 receptors observed in males may result in reduced NPY levels and thereby confer an anxiogenic effect. The stress-induced changes in Y2 receptor gene expression in the hippocampus found in our study were only evident in male animals but not in females. So far, only a few studies have systematically focused on sex differences with respect to individuals exposed to ELS, which is surprising since a considerable sex-bias in the prevalence of ELS-induced disorders has to be considered. A number of studies indicate that the sex of the offspring represents an important preprogrammed genetic factor for the consequences of early life adversities and the development of vulnerability or resilience in later life periods (Bock et al., 2011; Kunzler et al., 2015; Goodwill et al., 2019; Bath, 2020). However, literature on this topic is still quite controversial and does not yet reveal a clear picture of sex-specific effects since sex-bias is not consistent in terms of the direction of the outcome (reviews (Dalla et al., 2011; Bock et al., 2014; Seney and Sibille, 2014). Nevertheless, some of the findings of recent studies are in line with the findings of our study. For example, using high-resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, it was shown that exposure to ELS in mice induced fronto-limbic hyper-connectivity in males, but either no change or hypoconnectivity in females (White et al., 2020). Also, it was shown in C57BL/6 mice that ELS by maternal separation and restraint stress around puberty increased depression-like behavior only in males but not in females. Only a combination of both stressors increased depression-like behavior in both sexes (He et al., 2020). In line with these findings, it was shown that maternal separation in mice affected stress-physiology and anxiety-like outcomes only in males, whereas females remained unaffected. A similar finding was reported in rats where it was shown that females were resistant to developing a depressive phenotype after maternal separation (Dimatelis et al., 2016). Although far from understood, increasing evidence indicates that the differences between males and females in response to ELS or adult stress are the result of a sexual dimorphic development that leads to sex-differences in brain, behavior, and stress systems such as the HPA-axis (Bath, 2020). Sexual\nFrontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 936979\nhormones, androgens and estrogens, are thought to play a major role in these developmental processes and may also be involved in the stress response. Although it is unlikely that sexual hormones are directly affected during ELS (maternal separation), one has to consider that the brain undergoes a substantial reorganization and differentiation during adolescence, which is critically influenced by gonadal hormones. Since in our study, adult animals are investigated, we cannot exclude that changes in gonadal hormones during adolescence may affect the differential outcome between males and females in our study. Estrogens may also play a role in the stress response in adulthood. For females, it has been shown that the estrous cycle regulates dendritic spine turnover in the hippocampus and that stress-induced reduction in dendritic spine density is dependent on the presence of estrogen (Shors et al., 2001; McEwen et al., 2015). Gonadal hormones can also influence HPA-axis regulation and thereby affect the development of the stress response in later life (Panagiotakopoulos and Neigh, 2014). The development of the HPA-axis is also critically influenced by maternal care. Therefore, it is of interest that sex-specific differences in maternal care directed to male or female offspring are reported (Bath, 2020). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that sex-specific differences in maternal care during our ELS period may also contribute to the detected differences between males and females in this study."

            "text": "Another aim of this study was to address the hypothesis that ELS might exert a programming effect on the observed upregulation of Y2 receptor gene expression in response to AS exposure. In ELS pre-exposed male mice with additional exposure to AS (ELS+AS group), hippocampal Y2 receptor gene expression remained at the level of unstressed controls and was significantly lower when compared to the AS only group. Hence, ELS pre-exposure appears to \u201cbuffer\u201d against Y2R upregulation in response to AS and thereby may protect the animal from the negative consequences of AS by promoting stress coping (resilience). In view of the observed changes in DNA-methylation (see below), it is tempting to speculate\nthat ELS programs AS-induced Y2 receptor gene upregulation via epigenetic mechanisms. A similar \u201cprogramming\u201d effect of ELS towards effects of AS exposure on gene expression has also been observed in a previous study on hippocampal oxytocin receptor (OxtR) and arginine vasopressin receptor type 1a (AvpR1a) gene expression (Lesse et al., 2017). In this study, we found that ELS or AS alone had no effect on gene expression, whereas ELS pre-exposed animals displayed elevated hippocampal OxtR gene expression in response to AS exposure. The findings of our studies are also in line with other investigations on the effects of multiple/consecutive stressors (two- or multiple-hit concept), which found different gene expression patterns in the hippocampus of stress-na\u00efve animals in response to a single stressor when compared to animals, that were exposed to multiple stressors (Gray et al., 2014). Various studies, including our own, also show that vulnerable and resilient adaptations may occur depending on genetic predispositions and the type, duration, and time point of stress exposure (Nederhof and Schmidt, 2012; Daskalakis et al., 2013; Mc Elroy and Hevey, 2014). With regard to the findings of the present study on Y2R expression, the question arises what are the factors that are contributing to a potential \u201cprotective\u201d effect of ELS exposure. An important concept within this context is \u201csocial buffering\u201d stating that the presence and interaction with conspecifics can attenuate the stress response and as a long-term consequence, may help to promote adaptive processes influencing responses to adverse experiences in later life periods (Beery and Kaufer, 2015; Gunnar, 2017; Yirmiya et al., 2020; Avellaneda and Kamenetzky, 2021). In early life, an important social buffering factor is the maternal care behavior of the mother, while in later life, interaction with same age conspecifics, for example, littermates, provides an important environmental influence. Previous studies have revealed that stimulation of early postnatal maternal care behavior by handling can reverse or restore disturbed neurodevelopmental mechanisms and dysfunctional behavior induced by prenatal stress (Bock et al., 2011; Weinstock, 2017). For the present study, we cannot exclude that the lack of maternal care during the 3 h separation periods may be compensated by higher levels of maternal behavior upon reunion after separation or during the normal housing conditions for the rest of the day, thus contributing to the described effects. However, it appears unlikely that the applied ELS paradigm in this study stimulates specific maternal care behavior that promotes the proposed protective effects, since applying the identical ELS paradigm resulted in enhanced stress sensitivity and increased depressive-like behavior in previous studies (Lesse et al., 2017; Kohler et al., 2019). In contrast to these studies, where animals were reared in social isolation after weaning, in the present study, animals were housed socially in samesex groups with up to 3\u20135 animals until the time of the respective experiment. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that these postweaning and post-stress social rearing conditions provide a social buffering factor, stimulating protective adaptations. However, future experiments are required to analyze the critical role of post-stress rearing conditions for adaptive or maladaptive processes after ELS in more detail.\nFrontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 936979"

            "text": "There is increasing evidence that the programming effect of ELS on the brain and behavioral functions is mediated via epigenetic mechanisms (Alyamani and Murgatroyd, 2018; Li et al., 2020). Among epigenetic changes with respect to earlylife programming, DNA-methylation represents one of the bestunderstood mechanisms. This epigenetic modification represents a crucial regulator for the fine-tuning of gene expression, and the classical view is that enhanced DNA-methylation (hypermethylation) leads to decreased or even silenced gene expression. DNA-methylation can regulate and mediate the effects of a temporary exposure to early adverse situations into stable alterations in gene expression after the initial exposure has ended (Nuyt and Szyf, 2007).\nThus, another aim of this study was to address the hypothesis that the stress-induced alterations of Y2 receptor expression in response to ELS, AS, and to both consecutive stressors are epigenetically regulated via changes in DNA-methylation, specifically at the promoter region of the Y2 receptor gene. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the stressinduced changes in hippocampal Y2 receptor gene expression in male animals were accompanied by changes in DNAmethylation at the Y2 receptor gene promoter. Mean DNAmethylation over the 9 analyzed CpG-sites was affected by ELS (higher DNA-methylation) and by AS (lower DNA-methylation) indicating that the detected changes in Y2 receptor gene\nexpression are at least partly mediated via altered DNAmethylation. This association is further supported by the strong negative correlation of gene expression with mean DNAmethylation observed overall experimental groups. Moreover, in line with the findings on the gene expression level, we found additional support for the ELS programming hypothesis. Our CpG-site-specific analysis revealed that ELS exposure alone induced increased DNA-methylation only in two circumscribed CpG sites when compared to unstressed controls. In contrast, exposure only to adult stress (C+AS) resulted in decreased DNAmethylation at nearly all analyzed CpG-sites, when compared to unstressed controls. This effect was partly blocked by prior exposure to ELS. Taken together and as already outlined above, it is tempting to speculate that these subtle, well-defined CpGsite-specific changes in DNA-methylation may reflect a possible mechanism underlying ELS-induced long-term \u201cprogramming\u201d and thereby protect the ELS pre-exposed animals against \u201canxiogenic\u201d Y2 receptor changes in response to AS.\nWith respect to the interpretation of our data, one has to keep in mind that the regulation of gene expression is not only regulated by DNA methylation alone but also is orchestrated by a complex interaction with other epigenetic mechanisms such as posttranslational modifications of histones (Rothbart and Strahl, 2014). Several studies have reported that DNA methylation and histone modifications are mechanistically interdependent and play key roles in mediating the effects of environmental influences (Vaissiere et al., 2008; Ciccarone et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020). Epigenetically mediated changes in gene expression are\nFrontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 9 July 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 936979\nalso associated with inhibited or accelerated actions of specific transcription factors at the respective CpG sites in gene promoter regions. The region of our analyzed CpG-sites in the Y2 receptor promoter covers short-specific DNA sequence motifs for the transcription factor (SP1). SP1 is involved in the control of several processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, synaptic plasticity, stress, and immune response, and importantly, it is also involved in the regulation of NPY (Wernersson et al., 1998)."
