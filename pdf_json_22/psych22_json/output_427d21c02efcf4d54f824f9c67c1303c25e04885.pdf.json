    "abstractText": "Abstract Youth bullying is a global public health problem; Internet addiction is on the rise globally among youths. Because the linkage between these behaviors has not been clearly explicated, this integrative review evaluated the relevant empirical evidence. A search of five electronic databases identified 2,761 original citations published between January 2000 and May 2019. After further abstract screening and detailed evaluation of 262 full-text articles, the final sample consisted of 14 prospective descriptive studies representing 10 countries. Review results clearly established that the relationship between bullying and Internet addiction is firmly supported; less is known as to the contribution of gender, age, and other demographic variables, their impact on health outcomes, problematic behaviors, and the role of parental mediation. Inconsistent definitions and instrumentation and lack of sophisticated study designs limited the synthesis of findings. Future research is needed to explicate these relationships, so data-driven interventions can be developed.",

Composite findings support that approximately one-third of youths across the globe have been victimized by bullying (Elgar et\u00a0al., 2015; Modecki et\u00a0al., 2014). Bullying has traditionally been defined as being \u201cexposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons, and he or she has difficulty defending himself or herself\u201d (Olweus, 1993). Although the concept of\n* Rachel L. Difazio Rachel.difazio@childrens.harvard.edu\n1 William F.

One likely explanation for this is the rise of easy online access and its impact on youths\u2019 social interactions and psychological well-being as these increase the potential for cyberbullying perpetration and victimization (Livingstone et\u00a0al., 2016).\nInternet usage by today\u2019s youths is omnipresent, ranging from completing schoolwork to listening to music, gaming, and socially engaging with peers. While just over half used the Internet sporadically at the turn of the twenty-first century, virtually all of today\u2019s youths use it on a daily basis. The digital divide between rich and poor, metropolitan and rural, and across races and ethnicities has all but disappeared (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). Access to Internet sites is no longer dependent on computer availability. Today between 45 and 95% of adolescents across the USA, Europe, and Southeast Asia report having their own smartphones with many reporting being online \u201cconstantly\u201d and not being able to go more than a day without accessing their smartphone (Anderson & Jiang, 2018; Mak et\u00a0al., 2014; Mascheroni & \u00d3lafsson, 2016; Statistica, 2019). Moreover, the age of smartphone ownership continues to fall, now approximating age 10\u00a0years in some countries (Howard, 2017; Influence Central, 2016).\nNot only has youth Internet usage increased but so has the complexity of peer interactions through enticing online social media and gaming platforms (Wallace, 2014). These sites are easy to use and have bright graphics and other compelling features. Rooted in variable ratio, partial reinforcement programming, they are designed to encourage users to sustain a high level of connectivity (Wallace, 2014). For example, a user\u2019s behavior is reinforced by the number of \u201clikes,\u201d \u201cdislikes,\u201d \u201cshares,\u201d or \u201ccomments\u201d an online post receives by others or awards and penalties meted out in online games. Research findings support that online engagement influences a youth\u2019s developing sense of self and peer relations, for better or worse (Best et\u00a0al., 2014; Lemish, 2013; Richards et\u00a0al., 2015; Shapiro & Margolin, 2014).\nFor a subset of youths, online behavior can become compulsive and problematic, leading to disruptive family and peer relationships, physical and mental health problems, and worsening academic performance (Bailin et\u00a0al., 2014; G\u00e1mez-Guadix et\u00a0al., 2013; Guan & Subrahmanyam, 2009). This cluster of behaviors is often referred to as Internet addiction (IA) or Internet Addiction Disorder; the term IA will be used throughout this review (Wallace, 2014). Internet addiction among youths has increased exponentially during the COVID-19 pandemic along with interpersonal violence and mental health concerns related to bullying (Fegert et\u00a0al., 2020; Guessoum et\u00a0al., 2020; Lin, 2020; Paschke et\u00a0 al., 2021). Simultaneously, indications are that current cyberbullying rates and future susceptibility are on the rise (Jain et\u00a0al., 2020; Karmakar & Das, 2020), underscoring concerns regarding the synergic and harmful impact of these behaviors.\nExplicating the relationship between youths\u2019 risk for engaging in peer bullying and IA is needed to help develop meaningful interventions. This integrative review examines the current state of the science of youth bullying and IA and identifies areas for future research while providing initial implications for practice.\n1 3"

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for tracking sources (Moher et\u00a0 al., 2009). Original research articles were systematically sought by searching the following five databases: CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, PsychINFO, and ERIC. The searches included preferred terms for each database relating to bullying and IA, as well as variants of the following main keywords: technology dependency, addiction or overuse, and bullying victimization or perpetration. As the terms bullying and IA have been emerging terms, they are often inconsistently or vaguely defined, varying by the study date, discipline, and country of origin. To address this, specific criteria for both these terms were determined a priori and used in screening articles to determine relevance for this review. These definitional criteria and the components of the definition that were measured in each study can be found in Table\u00a01.\nUsing the publication date filters for each database, the results were restricted to citations published between 2000 and 2019. This start date correlates with the inception of professional interest in bullying as well as expanding adolescent Internet use (Monks & Coyne, 2011). Across these 2 decades, significant advancements in online gaming, the advent of social media, and the inception of new Internet platforms (i.e., smart phones, tablets) occurred, allowing trends associated with bullying to be tracked (Islam & Want, 2014; King, 2002; Van Dijck, 2013). All searches were conducted on May 31, 2019. A targeted, hand search of reference lists of papers meeting our inclusion criteria was also conducted to identify any additional relevant references."

The level of evidence and the quality of the article were assessed by two raters using the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Rating Scale (JHNEBPS) (Dang & Dearholt, 2017). Articles were assigned a level of evidence (I\u2013V) based on their study design, ranging from experimental studies being classified as level I and experiential and non-research being classified as level V (Dang & Dearholt, 2017). The quality rating of the study was based on the level of evidence and ranged from A (high quality) to C (low quality or having major flaws). The quality ratings were completed by two members of the research team. A study with a high-quality rating was consistent, had generalizable results, has an adequate sample size for the study design, ensured adequate control, reported definitive conclusions, and had consistent recommendations based on a literature review, whereas a low-quality study had little evidence with inconsistent results, insufficient sample size for the study\n1 3\ndesign, and conclusions that could not be drawn (Dang & Dearholt, 2017). When disagreements among the raters occurred on the quality assessments, the original manuscript and JHNEBPS were consulted and discussed until consensus was reached. If consensus could not be reached through discussion, the entire study team met to discuss the article. The first author served as the final decision-maker."

Of note is that although the timeframe for the search spanned from 2000 to 2019, all of the studies that met the inclusion criteria were published in the last 7\u00a0 years, supporting the increased recognition of these co-existing behaviors. All studies in this review were level III evidence indicating that they were all non-experimental studies or qualitative studies. The quality of the studies was as follows: high quality (N = 4), good quality (N = 8), and low quality or major flaws (N = 2).\nDespite applying tight screening criteria in determining the final sample of articles, the conceptual and operational descriptions of bullying and IA varied widely across studies; only four studies explicitly used both terms (see Table\u00a01). All studies, despite varying quality, were included if they were aligned with the aims of the review."

            "text": "The co-existence of bullying and IA was supported across this entire body of research. The majority (n = 9) of the research studies focused solely on cyberbullying, while five studies discussed bullying more broadly. With the exception of cyberbullying, other specific forms of bullying such as physical and relational bullying were not explicated addressed.\nIt was generally reported that youths with IA had both significantly higher rates of victimization or victimization/perpetration (victim-bullies) from general bullying (Nasaescu et\u00a0al., 2018; Zsila et\u00a0al., 2018) and cyberbullying (Chang et\u00a0al., 2015; Handono et\u00a0al., 2019; Jung et\u00a0al., 2014; Nartg\u00fcn & Cicio\u011flu, 2015; Tsimtsiou et\u00a0al., 2018; Yudes-G\u00f3mez et\u00a0al., 2018; Zsila et\u00a0al., 2018) than compared to youths without IA. Tsimtsiou et\u00a0al. reported that cyber-perpetrators were more likely to be victimized within a year\u2019s time, further explicating the relationship between victim-perpetrator. Other reports, however, only demonstrated a significant association between IA and bullying perpetration but not victimization (Busch, et\u00a0al., 2013; G\u00e1mez-Guadix et\u00a0al., 2016; \u0160incek et\u00a0al., 2017). Although the association between bullying and IA is clearly established, causal relationships are poorly determined. Little longitudinal data is also available, although G\u00e1mez-Guadix et\u00a0al. demonstrated that IA increased cyberbullying perpetration across two measurement points 6\u00a0months apart.\nDifferent forms of IA were captured in the instruments used across these studies. These included excessive screen time (Busch et\u00a0al., 2013; Kircaburun & Ba\u015ftu\u011f, 2016; Nartg\u00fcn & Cicio\u011flu, 2015; Tsimtsiou et\u00a0 al., 2018; Yu & Chao, 2016); extensive or risky social\n1 3\nTa bl\ne 2\nO ve\nrv ie\nw o\nf e vi\nde nc\ne\nPr im\nar y\nau th\nor , y\nea r,\nco un\ntry St\nud y\npu rp\nos e\nD es\nig n,\nsi te\n, s am\npl e,\nJH\nN EB\nPS ra\ntin g1\nM et\nho ds\nM ea\nsu re\nm en\nt2 of\nbu\nlly in\ng M\nea su\nre m\nen t2\nof\nIn te\nrn et\na dd\nic tio\nn (I\nA )\nFi nd\nin gs\nB us\nch e\nt\u00a0a l.\n(2 01 3) N et he rla nd\ns Ex\nam in\ned th\ne as\nso ci atio ns o f s cr ee n tim e (I nt er ne t/v id eo ga m es /te le vi si on ) w ith h ea lth -r el at ed be ha vi or s a nd o ut - co m es in a do le sc en ts\nPr os\npe ct\niv e\nde sc\nrip -\ntiv e\n5 hi\ngh sc\nho ol s N = 2, 42 5 (m al e = 1,\n07 7,\nfe\nm al\ne = 1,\n34 8)\nA ge\nra ng\ne:\n11 \u20131\n8\u00a0 ye\nar s\n(M =\n13 .8 ) JH N EB PS ra\ntin g:\nII IB\nSe lf-\nre po\nrt qu\nes tio nna ire c om pl et ed at 1 ti m e po in t i n sc ho ol s; a su bs et o f th e U tre ch t H ea lth y Sc ho ol S ur ve y\nQ ue\nsti on\ns d ra\nw n\nfro m\nth\ne O\nlw eu\ns b ul\nly /\nvi ct\nim q\nue sti\non na\nire\n(S ol\nbe rg\n& O\nlw eu s, 20 03 )\nC om\npu ls\niv e\nIn te\nrn et\nus\ne sc\nal e\n(M ee\nrk er\nk et\n\u00a0a l.,\n20\n09 )\nV id\neo g\nam e\nad di\nct io n te\nst (v an R\noo ij,\n2 01\n1)\n\u2022E xc\nes si\nve sc\nre en\nti m e w as a ss oc ia te d w ith bu lly in g, b ei ng b ul - lie d, sk ip pi ng sc ho ol , al co ho l u se , u nh ea lth y ea tin g ha bi ts , a nd le ss ph ys ic al a ct iv ity \u2022C om pu ls iv e an d ex ce ss iv e sc re en ti m e w er e as so ci at ed w ith ps yc ho so ci al p ro bl em s an d be in g ov er w ei gh t C ha ng e t\u00a0a l.

Other studies provided a bit more information, with excessive screen time (Busch et\u00a0 al., 2013; Nartg\u00fcn & Cicio\u011flu, 2015; Tsimtsiou et\u00a0 al., 2018), compulsive video game playing (Busch et\u00a0al., 2013; \u0160incek et\u00a0al., 2017; Tsimtsiou et\u00a0al. 2018), and high viewing rates of pornography/violence (Chang et\u00a0al., 2015; Tsimtsiou et\u00a0al. 2018) being the most common form of IA."

Tsimtsiou et\u00a0al. (2018) reported that Greek males were more likely to be perpetrators, had a longer history of Internet usage, and viewed online pornography, while their female counterparts were more likely to be victims, older, and engaged in social media. Problematic gaming was significantly associated with both traditional and cyberbullying victimization and perpetration in males (Rasmussen et\u00a0al., 2015; \u0160incek, et\u00a0al., 2017). The impact of problematic computer gaming on bullying perpetration and victimization was seen in youths of both genders with both genders reporting having fewer friendships (Rasmussen et\u00a0al. 2015).\nVery little information could be culled from other key demographic constructs including age, race and ethnicity, and socio-economic status. For the three studies that examined the impact of age, the results were inconsistent. Nartg\u00fcn and Cicio\u011flu (2015) reported no difference in youths\u2019 views on cyberbullying or problematic Internet use based on age. Higher IA in older youths was reported by Nasaescu et\u00a0al. (2018), while greater problematic gaming in younger youths was reported by \u0160incek et\u00a0al. (2017). Despite that many of countries where these studies were conducted have numerous racially and ethnically diverse subpopulations, these attributes were not explicitly addressed."

Unfortunately, many studies did examine correlations between IA and psychosocial outcomes such as low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety but did not fully model these relationships with the inclusion of bullying in their analyses (Busch et\u00a0al., 2013; Chang et\u00a0al., 2015; Yu & Chao, 2016). The influence of confounding effects of the duration of screen time, diverse screen time behaviors (e.g., social networking, gaming, viewing pornography), and effect of health-related outcomes was also not clearly explicated (Busch et\u00a0 al., 2013; Kircaburun & Ba\u015ftu\u011f, 2016). Little information was available regarding the impact of physical health problems. Although some physical problems, such as poorer nutritional habits and the use of alcohol (Busch et\u00a0al., 2013; Chang et\u00a0al., 2015), were linked to IA, the concomitant influence of the bullying was not investigated. Zsila et\u00a0al. (2018) did demonstrate that\n1 3\nIA in combination with psychoactive substance use predicted bullying and cyberbullying victimization.\nLow levels of social and emotional competence were related to IA and greater bullying victimization and perpetration, with a stronger relationship being reported for perpetrators than victims (Nasaescu et\u00a0al., 2018; Rasmussen et\u00a0al. 2015). Clusters of risky behaviors also were reported. For example, G\u00e1mez-Guadix et\u00a0 al.

            "text": "Historically males were reported to engage in bullying more commonly than females; there is now some support that bullying perpetration and victimization are equalizing across genders (Olweus, 1993; Pontes et\u00a0al., 2018; Smith et\u00a0al., 2019). Emerging knowledge suggests that the relationships between gender roles in bullying perpetuation and victimization and their prevalence are complex, mediated by age, the rise of Internet usage, and cyberbullying and the influence of cultural norms (Casper & Card, 2017; Smith et\u00a0al., 2019).\nIt is not surprising that when viewed from the singular perspective of bullying, females are more vulnerable to relational bullying that occurs on social networking sites, while males are more vulnerable to bullying from gaming sites where aggression is often prominent (Casper & Card, 2017; Smith et\u00a0al., 2019). When bullying was examined through the lens of IA, however, the co-existence of these behaviors was far more common in males. While there is scant explanatory evidence, Nartg\u00fcn and Cicio\u011flu (2015) posit that the Turkish males in their sample had more autonomy, were able to frequent cybercafes, and were relatively unsupervised allowing them to engage in IA and bullying.\nOf note, no study reported participants with gender variance, those youths whose gender expression does not conform to socially defined male or female gender norms. This is a an important issue as both IA and bullying are more likely to occur in youths with nonconforming gender expression with the participants experiencing greater harm (Cooper & Blumenfeld, 2012; DeLonga et\u00a0al., 2011; Peltzer & Pengpid, 2016; Wiederhold, 2014). It is recognized, however, in some of the countries represented across these studies that expression of gender variance is illegal or in opposition to cultural norms (Erasing 76 Crimes,\n1 3\n2019). The importance of employing a socio-cultural approach in investigating the role gender plays in IA mediated bullying is highly needed.\nThat no clear differences in the co-existence of these behaviors by age are identified is not surprising as both behaviors are robust in adolescent populations. Failure to examine different racial and ethnic subgroups is a concern. Youths from cultural orientations different from the mainstream, especially if not politically recognized or shunned, are a high risk for bullying (Vessey, et\u00a0al., 2013). Such youths may also be drawn to Internet social media and gaming sites, falsely perceiving personal anonymity and safety (Wright, 2014)."

            "text": "Inconsistent definitions and instrumentation and lack of sophisticated study designs limited the synthesis of findings. The lack of clear conceptual and operational definitions for the variables of interest hindered the identification, collation, and interpretation of the data. The concept of youth IA is becoming prevalent in addiction literature, but specific diagnostic criteria remain elusive. Early measurement schemes focused on screen time, but as many youths report being online \u201call of the time\u201d for academic and socialization, it is harder to determine how much screen time constitutes normative behavior. To date, the term IA or its variants are only beginning to be recognized despite 15\u00a0years of research in this area.\nThe WHO\u2019s International Classification of Diseases, the global standard for coding health information and causes of death, listed gaming disorder in its 11th edition as a new diagnosis, but did not address the broader construct of IA (WHO, 2018). In other countries, including South Korea and China, video gaming is recognized as a specific diagnostic disorder, allowing treatment protocols to be developed (Parekh, 2018). The term, problematic Internet use, with specific emphasis on Internet gaming disorders, was studied for inclusion in American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic Statistical Manual 5 (DSM) but ultimately was not included due to insufficient research (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Petry et\u00a0al., 2015). It was included in the \u201cEmerging Measures and Models\u201d section, an area underscoring the need for additional evidence.\nThe seminal definition for bullying was promulgated by Norwegian-Swedish Psychologist Olweus in 1983 as noted in this paper\u2019s introduction (Olweus, 1991). This definition has served as the benchmark for much of the bullying research worldwide despite its inherent limitations. Over time, researchers, educators, policy-makers, and non-professionals have shaped the definition of bullying to best suit their own work (Arora, 1996; Smith et\u00a0al., 2002). No international standard currently exists. Recognizing the need for a uniform definition of bullying that encompasses its different modes (i.e., direct and indirect) and types (i.e., physical, verbal, relational, property damage) to be used in surveillance, research, and education, a uniform definition was released in 2014 by the US National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Department of Education. It reads \u201cBullying is any unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or group of youths who are not siblings or current dating partners that involves an observed or perceived power imbalance and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated. Bullying may inflict harm or distress on the targeted youth including physical, psychological, social, or educational harm (Gladden, et\u00a0 al., 2014). This definition has been widely adopted in the USA but not yet globally. The lack of operational definitions of for the two key variables\u2014bullying and IA\u2014has created discordance across this body of work.\n1 3\nBecause of the lack of conceptual clarity, the terms bullying and IA have been operationalized across the research literature using a diverse array of assessment instruments of varying quality (King et\u00a0 al., 2011; Vessey, et\u00a0 al., 2014). This was seen in the studies included in this review. Bullying was measured using seven different standardized instruments, selected questions from three different instruments, and four investigator-created measures. IA was measured using seven standardized instruments, including six variations of the Problematic Internet Use Scale, and two investigator-created measures (Table\u00a02). For the standardized measures, their specific psychometric properties and appropriateness for the samples under investigation were rarely discussed. When psychometric properties were reported, this information is included in Table\u00a02. Moreover, all of these instruments used self-report with its inherent issues of social desirability and likely under-reporting despite the assurance of anonymity by most investigators.\nA significant limitation across these studies was that the majority used cross-sectional designs precluding the establishment of causal relationships between IA and bullying. Numerous internalizing and externalizing psychosocial problems including but not limited to anxiety and depression, suicidality, truancy, and substance use have been tied to both bullying and IA independently (Lam, 2014; Ostovar et\u00a0al., 2016; Reijntjes et\u00a0al., 2010, 2011). Little is known, however, as to the synergies created across bullying, IA, these diverse behaviors, and their impact on youths\u2019 health-related quality of life. Synergies created by co-occurrence of these conditions on mental health could have a more profound and enduring impact on overall health-related quality of life (Anderson et\u00a0al., 2017; Klomek, et\u00a0al., 2015; Takizawa et\u00a0al., 2014; Zarate-Garza et\u00a0al., 2017)."

            "text": "The findings of this review have underscored the need for additional research that examines the interplay that both bullying and IA have on youth mental health. Research is required that uses more rigorous prospective, longitudinal designs, and sophisticated inferential analyses across bullying, IA, and other variables of interest. Investigation of the influence of cultural and other contextual variables such as Internet literacy, accessibility, gender roles, and impact of parental involvement, on health-related quality of life is needed. Instrumentation that goes beyond self-report surveys and includes teacher and parent reports, peer nomination, and investigator observations would aid in validating these initial results. Qualitative studies would further inform these empiric findings. A fuller understanding of these relationships is foundational to the development and testing of datadriven interventions.\nThe high comorbidity between bullying and IA supports that formalized screening approaches for both disorders be instituted in educational, medical, and mental health settings. If problems are noted, additional screening for psychiatric disorders is warranted. Current educational programming for bullying prevention must include content of technology abuse, including appropriate expression of emotions (Nasaescu et\u00a0al., 2018). Another essential component of such programming is to strengthen opportunities for parental engagement. This will allow for tailoring of interventions specifically designed for the population of interest.\nAcross the globe, policies and regulations for both bullying prevention and mediation and Internet usage by youths are wide-ranging and reflect national cultural mores and political agendas. While differing avenues of oversight and intervention may be implemented,\n1 3\nall should acknowledge the relationship between youth bullying and IA, its consequences to youths, families, and society and implement appropriate prevention and intervention strategies."

Professionals involved with improving youths\u2019 mental health must consider the roles that bullying, IA, or its co-occurrence may play in behavioral health issues. International standardization of definitions for bullying and internet addiction will promote high-quality future qualitative and quantitative research to more fully explicate these relationships, thus allowing for the creation and testing of theory-driven interventions.\nAuthor Contribution \u2022 Vessey, DiFazio, and Dorste conceptualized the review. \u2022 Dorste performed the literature search. \u2022 Vessey, DiFazio, and Neil completed the data analysis. \u2022 Vessey, DiFazio, Neil, and Dorste drafted the manuscript. \u2022 All members of the study team reviewed the final draft and approved submission of this manuscript."
