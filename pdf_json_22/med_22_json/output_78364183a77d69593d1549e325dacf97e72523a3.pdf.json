    "abstractText": "Liaoyu white cattle (LYWC) is a local breed in Liaoning Province, China. It has the advantages of grow quickly, high slaughter ratew, high meat quality and strong antistress ability. N methyladenosine (m6A) is a methylation modification of N position of RNA adenine, which is an important modification mechanism affecting physiological phenomena. In this study, we used the longissimus dorsi muscle of LYWC and SIMC for m6A-seq and RNA-seq high-throughput sequencing, and identified the key genes involved in muscle growth and m6A modification development by bioinformatics analysis. There were 31532m6A peaks in the whole genome of LYWC and 47217m6A peaks in the whole genome of SIMC. Compared with Simmental cattle group, LYWC group had 17,351 differentially expressed genes: 10,697 genes were up-regulated, 6,654 genes were down regulated, 620 differentially expressed genes were significant, while 16,731 differentially expressed genes were not significant. Among the 620 significantly differentially expressed genes, 295 genes were up-regulated and 325 genes were down regulated. In order to explore the relationship between m6A and mRNA expression in the muscles of LYWC and SIMC, the combined analysis of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq revealed that 316 genes were m6A modified with mRNA expression. To identify differentially methylated genes related to muscle growth, four related genes were selected for quantitative verification in LYWC and SIMC. GO enrichment and KEGG analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes modified by m6A are mainly involved in skeletal muscle contraction, steroid biosynthesis process, redox process, PPAR pathway and fatty acid metabolism, and galactose metabolism. These results provide a theoretical basis for further research on the role of m6A in muscle growth and development.",

It has the advantages of grow quickly, high slaughter ratew, high meat quality and strong antistress ability. N6 methyladenosine (m6A) is a methylation modification of N6 position of RNA adenine, which is an important modification mechanism affecting physiological phenomena. In this study, we used the longissimus dorsi muscle of LYWC and SIMC for m6A-seq and RNA-seq high-throughput sequencing, and identified the key genes involved in muscle growth and m6A modification development by bioinformatics analysis. There were 31532m6A peaks in the whole genome of LYWC and 47217m6A peaks in the whole genome of SIMC. Compared with Simmental cattle group, LYWC group had 17,351 differentially expressed genes: 10,697 genes were up-regulated, 6,654 genes were down regulated, 620 differentially expressed genes were significant, while 16,731 differentially expressed genes were not significant. Among the 620 significantly differentially expressed genes, 295 genes were up-regulated and 325 genes were down regulated. In order to explore the relationship between m6A and mRNA expression in the muscles of LYWC and SIMC, the combined analysis of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq revealed that 316 genes were m6A modified with mRNA expression. To identify differentially methylated genes related to muscle growth, four related genes were selected for quantitative verification in LYWC and SIMC. GO enrichment and KEGG analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes modified by m6A are mainly involved in skeletal muscle contraction, steroid biosynthesis process, redox process, PPAR pathway and fatty acid metabolism, and galactose metabolism. These results provide a theoretical basis for further research on the role of m6A in muscle growth and development.\nKeywords: m6A methylation, RNA-seq, muscle growth and development, genetic modification, species\nINTRODUCTION\nTo date, more than 150 types of posttranscriptional modifications have been identified in the RNA of all living organisms (Boccaletto et al., 2018). The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification was discovered in the 1970s and was originally considered to be an abundant nucleotide modification of mRNA in eukaryotic cells (Jia et al., 2013; Yue et al., 2015). Biological functions of m6A modification are mediated\nEdited by: Krzysztof Flisikowski,\nTechnical University of Munich, Germany\nReviewed by: Haojie Zhang,\nGuangxi University, China Jiangbo Wei,\nUniversity of Chicago, United States\n*Correspondence: Peng Li Lipeng2018@syau.edu.cn Lin Li Lilin619619@syau.edu.cn\n\u2020These authors have contributed equally to this work\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to Epigenomics and Epigenetics, a section of the journal Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology\nReceived: 21 December 2021 Accepted: 22 February 2022 Published: 10 March 2022\nCitation: Dang Y, Dong Q, Wu B, Yang S, Sun J, Cui G, Xu W, Zhao M, Zhang Y, Li P and Li L (2022) Global Landscape of m6A Methylation of Differently Expressed Genes in Muscle Tissue of\nLiaoyu White Cattle and Simmental Cattle.\nFront.

It is involved in various biological processes, such as lipid production and energy metabolism (Zhao et al., 2014;Wang et al., 2015a). In addition, m6A methylation regulates the splicing, expression, decay and translation of mRNA (Wang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015b; Xiao et al., 2016). Until recently, little was known about the specific function and mechanism of m6A. Similar to DNA and histone methylation, m6A methylation is also dynamic and reversible in mammals (Wang et al., 2019). It is modulated by several genes, including methyltransferases (METTL3, METTL4 and WTAP) (Liu et al., 2014; Ping et al., 2014), demethylases (ALKBH5 and FTO), (Jia et al., 2011; Zheng et al., 2013) and reading proteins (YTHDF, eIF3 and HNRNPC) (Cao et al., 2016). m6A modification is co installed by a variety of protein complexes (Roundtree et al., 2017). For example, YTHDF2 binds to m6A in mRNA to degrade target genes, while YTHDF1, YTHDF3 and eIF3 promote the translation of m6A containing transcripts (Wang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015a; Meyer et al., 2015). As the transferase of writers, METTL3 is composed of catalytic subunit and many other auxiliary subunits. This protein is very important for embryonic growth and development. Embryos lacking METTL3 show pluripotent degradation and damage (Geula et al., 2015). The distribution of mettl3 varies with the type of cell line. In some cases, the change of cell state will lead to the change of its distribution (Knuckles et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2017). In the cytoplasm,METTL3 itself recognizes the 3\u2032UTR m6A site on mRNA and promotes the formation of translation loop through the interaction with eif3h, so as to promote the protein translation of transcripts (Shi et al., 2019). METTL3 can be functionally regulated by PTM or its protein interaction. It is reported that METTL14 in human cells is phosphorylated at the residue serine399 site on the protein interface with METTL3, indicating that mettl3 has a regulatory function (Wang et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2019). m6A readers protein contains two kinds: one is a stable and direct protein containing YT521-B homology (YTH) domain, and the other is the common RNA binding domain (RBD) (Shi et al., 2019). Both the YTH domain family 1\u20133 (YTHDF1-3) and the YTH domain containing 1\u20132 (YTHDC1-2) in humans are stable and directly exercise the reading function of m6A.YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 translation initiation factors promote the translation of target transcripts in cells, and YTHDC2 mediates mRNA stability and translation and regulates cell development (Hsu et al., 2017). The other uses the common RNA binding domain (RBD), such as K homology (KH) domain, RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain and arginine/glycine rich (RGG) domain to preferentially bind the m6A containing region in RNA and exercise the function of m6A reader by regulating the surrounding RNA protein interaction (Shi et al., 2019). Most studies on m6A modification have focused on humans and mice (Dominissini et al., 2012). Them6Amethylation is related to obesity (Wang et al., 2020). FTOwas the first m6AmRNAdemethylase that was discovered. It mediates DNA and RNA demethylation (Jia et al., 2011). The m6A demethylase FTO plays a key role in regulating postpartum growth and energy consumption. A study reported that AMPK regulates lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle cells by regulating FTO expression and FTO-dependent demethylation of m6A (Wu et al., 2017). Research reports on mouse animal models\nhave shown that FTO plays an important role in the regulation of fat mass, adipogenesis, and body weight (Church et al., 2009; Fischer et al., 2009; Church et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2010; McMurray et al., 2013; Merkestein et al., 2015; Ronkainen et al., 2016).\nLYWC are excellent beef cattle based on Charolais, breeding the fourth-generation hybrid herd with Liaoning local cattle as the female parent in Liaoning Province, China. A stable population with 93.75% Charolais pedigree and 6.25% local cattle pedigree was formed. LYWC grow quickly, and the slaughter rate was also higher than that of other beef cattle breeds. Due to the large market demand for beef in China, most farms choose LYWC for its excellent production performance. LYWC has wide adaptability, strong stress resistance, and outstanding cold resistance ability and can withstand a low-temperature environment of \u221230\u00b0C. Although LYWC has a better growth rate and slaughter rate, its rough myofiber always influences beef quality directly compared to Simmental and other beef cattle (Jing et al., 2011; Shuangyong et al., 2011). A large number studies have shown that m6A modification plays an important role in regulating lipid production and energy metabolism, inflammatory mechanisms and tumor formation. Based on the necessary functions of m6A modification in regulating gene expression and involving various biological processes, we speculate that m6A modification is involved in beef cattle muscle growth and development. In this study, we aimed to explore the global landscape of differentially expressed m6A methylation genes in muscle tissue between LYWC and SIMC and provide a theoretical basis for further research on the specific regulatory mechanism of unique meat quality and the optimization and selection of LYWC breeds. However, the effect, mechanism, and function of m6A modification on muscle growth and development still needs further research in the future."

The edger input file was raw counts, and we used edger to analyze the PVAL and qval of the results, calculate fpkm values to measure the expression levels of genes, and compare the fold difference obtained by means of fpkm expression compared to the fold change. Functional enrichment we mapped differential gene functional annotations into different GO term/KEGG pathways by writing our own script, embodying the difference test as a hypergeometric test. The integration of MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq data is related through the annotation of peak, and the qualitative correlation is determined through the up/down of the two parts of regulation.

However, there are still few reports on beef cattle. We speculate that m6A is involved in the muscle growth and development process of beef cattle. Our data show that there are a large number of methylation modifications during muscle growth and development. It may have an important effect on the types of muscle fibers, the maturation of muscle cells, and the changes in muscle structure.\nThrough laser-induced microdamage of zebrafish muscles combined with cell repair, it was found that the XIRP1 gene is abundant in skeletal muscle and involved in cell repair, cells and new myofibrils, and the repair of damage does not involve cell proliferation (Otten et al., 2012). Troponin T (TNNT1) exists as a group of homologous proteins in the striated muscle of vertebrates and invertebrates. Mutations in the TNNT1 gene can cause rod-shaped myopathy. From animal model experiments, it was found that lack of TNNT1 reduced the content of slow fibers, accompanied by type II fiber hypertrophic growth and increased muscle fatigue (Feng et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2014). Myosin 2 (MYOM2) is the main component of the myofibril M-band of the sarcomere and the central gene in the interaction of sarcomere genes (AuxerrePlantie et al., 2020). Research by Auxerre-Planti\u00e9 found that loss of function and moderate knockdown of this gene can lead to myocardial expansion, and severe knockdown can lead to increased sarcomeric myosin (Auxerre-Plantie et al., 2020). Research by Andrei found that in hypothyroid rats, MYOM2 expression increased 3.4 times. Through small-molecule interference of RNA with MYOM2, it was found that the contraction speed of cardiomyocytes were severely reduced\n(Rozanski et al., 2013). Myosin heavy chain 6 (MYH6) is widely found mainly in the heart and smooth muscle. This gene is mainly expressed in type I fibers. The presence or absence of MYH6 and its family gene MYH7 determines the slow or fast-twitch phenotype of skeletal muscle (Stuart et al., 2016).\nBased on GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis, we speculate that m6A modification in genes has potentially important functions and may play a vital role in certain pathways are involved in cell growth and development. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. They are ligand-activated receptors in the nuclear hormone receptor family. Three subtypes have been found in different species, which control many intracellular metabolic processes. The subtypes include PPAR\u03b1 (also known as NR1C1). PPAR\u03b1 participates in the liver and skeletal muscle through regulation and expression of lipid metabolism genes. PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 participates in lipid oxidation and cell proliferation. PPAR\u03b3 promotes the differentiation of adipocytes to enhance blood glucose uptake. PPAR transcriptional activity can be regulated by nongene crosstalk with phosphatases and kinases, including ERK1/2, p38-MAPK, PKA, PKC, AMPK and GSK3. At the same time, nuclear receptor coactivator (coactivator) and PPAR-RXR act synergistically and complement and stabilize the active transcription complex, which can regulate lipid metabolism and fat formation, maintain metabolic homeostasis and the expression of inflammation genes, and induce anticancer effects in a variety of human tumors.\nThe m6A regulation level of the differentially expressed genes screened in this study was negatively correlated with the transcription level. The RNA-seq results showed that the differential gene expression in LYWC was lower than that in SIM. The results of qRT-PCR showed that the differentially expressed genes for m6A methylation were all present in the muscle tissue of beef cattle. Therefore, this indicates that m6A modification not only participates in the process of muscle growth and development but may also regulate mRNA degradation.\nSkeletal muscle development is a complex biological process. The regulatory role of myogenic regulatory factors and the study of apparent modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modification, in the regulation of skeletal muscle development have given us a preliminary understanding of the regulatory network of skeletal muscle development. Based on the involvement of m6A in the regulation of mouse brain development, fat formation, and other tissue development processes, we speculate that m6A is also involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle development (Zhao et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). Studies have shown that the regulation of METTL3 gene expression and regulation of m6A levels in myoblasts affect the differentiation process of myocytes and the expression of key regulatory genes (Kudou et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019). This shows that m6A is involved in the regulation of muscle cell differentiation. During the development of animal embryos and the growth and development of brain tissue after birth, neural stem cells are required for differentiation and self-\nFIGURE 5 | The result obtained by taking the intersection of the gene where the significant difference m6A peak is located and the significant difference expression gene is used, and a stricter screening threshold is used.\nFrontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 84051310\nTABLE 6 | M6A -modified candidate genes related to muscle cell growth and development.\nGene name Gene ID M6A regulation Gene regulation FPKM.LYWC_input FPKM.SIM_input\nLYWC1 LYWC2 LYWC3 SIM1 SIM2 SIM3\nTNNT1 282095 up Down 6852.32 4722.65 7863.95 14067.95 12547.06 20219.39 MYOM2 524077 up Down 603.17 446.51 330.98 990.94 1472.69 395.06 XIRP1 509670 up Down 235.30 353.27 241.41 1260.87 1205.70 609.67 MYH6 100296004 up Down 156.23 115.56 364.75 508.30 365.54 564.40\nFrontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www.frontiersin.org March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 84051311\nrenewal. Studies have shown that knocking out METTL14 in mouse embryos will interrupt the cycle of radial glial cells in the nerves, which will eventually lead to a decrease in the thickness of the cerebral cortex and even death after birth. Overexpression and specific knockout of the FTO and METTL3 genes in pig adipocytes revealed that FTO expression levels are negatively correlated with m6A levels and positively correlated with adipogenesis, while METTL3 expression levels are positively correlated with m6A levels and negatively correlated with adipogenesis (Wang et al., 2015b). Mice lacking FTO function experience increased energy expenditure, growth retardation, lean body size after birth and deformity (Boissel et al., 2009). Through transcriptome sequencing of the muscle tissues of three different breeds of wild boar, Landrace pig and Rongchang pig, a complete transcriptome map of m6A was drawn. It was found that m6A is widely distributed in muscle tissue, and m6A is mainly enriched in related gene stop codons, 3\u2032UTRs, and protein coding-regions. In addition, data show that there is a clear m6A peak around the stop codon of the cAMP response element-binding protein CREB and zinc finger protein ZNF-related genes, indicating that m6A is enriched here. CREB was first discovered as a transcriptional regulator of cell metabolism that regulates the cAMP response. It is an important gene regulating somatostatin. ZNF has also been considered one of the most important eukaryotic transcription factors and plays an important role in gene regulation.\nIn conclusion, this study analyzed m6A methylation modification in the muscle tissue of Liaoyu white cattle and Simmental cattle. Based on our experimental results, we\nspeculate that m6A modification plays an important role in muscle growth and development. This study shows that TNNT1, XIRP1, MYOM2, and MYH6 are likely to play a key role in muscle growth and muscle differentiation. In addition, the data obtained through high-throughput sequencing provide a theoretical basis for further exploring the function of m6A modification on muscle growth and development. At the same time, the regulatory mechanism of m6A modification in muscle still needs to be studied in depth in the future."
