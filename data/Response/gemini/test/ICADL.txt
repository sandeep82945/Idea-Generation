1. **Investigate the impact of different training objectives on the quality of multi-perspective summaries.** The paper proposes two different training objectives for the multi-perspective summarization model: Multibest and Multimean. Future research could explore other training objectives and compare their performance to the ones presented in the paper. This could help identify the most effective training objective for generating high-quality multi-perspective summaries.


2. **Explore the use of different neural network architectures for multi-perspective summarization.** The paper uses a transformer-based neural network architecture for multi-perspective summarization. Future research could investigate the use of other neural network architectures, such as recurrent neural networks or convolutional neural networks, to see if they can achieve better performance.


3. **Investigate the impact of different pre-trained language models on the quality of multi-perspective summaries.** The paper uses the BART large pre-trained language model for multi-perspective summarization. Future research could explore the use of other pre-trained language models, such as BERT or GPT-3, to see if they can achieve better performance.


4. **Investigate the use of multi-perspective summarization for other types of documents.** The paper focuses on multi-perspective summarization of scientific papers. Future research could explore the use of multi-perspective summarization for other types of documents, such as news articles, blog posts, or social media posts. This could help determine the generalizability of the proposed approach to different types of text.


5. **Investigate the use of multi-perspective summarization for real-world applications.** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-perspective summarization on a benchmark dataset. Future research could explore the use of multi-perspective summarization for real-world applications, such as generating summaries of customer reviews or product descriptions. This could help determine the practical utility of the proposed approach.
