Longitudinal Study on the Long-term Effects of the Lifting Intervention: Conduct a comprehensive longitudinal study to assess the long-term impacts of the lifting intervention on healthcare workers. This study could evaluate not just the immediate biomechanical improvements but also how these changes affect the incidence of musculoskeletal injuries over time. Additionally, it would be beneficial to measure the sustainability of the learned lifting techniques and whether continuous training or refresher courses are needed to maintain or improve the initial benefits.

Comparative Study Between Different Lifting Interventions: Initiate a comparative study to evaluate the effectiveness of various lifting interventions, including the current intervention, traditional lifting techniques taught in nursing programs, and the use of mechanical lifting devices. This research could help identify the most effective strategies or combinations thereof for reducing musculoskeletal injuries among healthcare workers in different settings, including emergency situations where mechanical devices are not feasible.

Evaluating the Impact of Intervention on Patient Outcomes: While the primary focus is on the health and safety of healthcare workers, it's equally important to assess how lifting interventions impact patient care outcomes. Research could explore whether improved lifting techniques lead to a reduction in patient handling errors, a decrease in patient discomfort, or a lower incidence of skin tears and other injuries during movement.

Development and Testing of a Specialized Training Program for Emergency Situations: Given the unique challenges presented in emergency care settings, developing and testing a specialized lifting and patient handling intervention tailored for emergency healthcare workers could be highly beneficial. This could include techniques optimized for use in confined spaces, on EMS stretchers, and under high-stress conditions, potentially incorporating virtual reality or augmented reality for training purposes.

Investigation into the Role of Wearable Technology in Reducing Musculoskeletal Injuries: Explore the potential of wearable technology, such as exoskeletons or smart garments, to assist healthcare workers in lifting and moving patients safely. This research could include the development of wearable devices that provide real-time feedback on body mechanics or that physically augment the worker's ability to lift safely. The study could assess the practicality, effectiveness, and acceptability of such technologies in healthcare settings, comparing their impact on musculoskeletal injury rates to that of manual lifting interventions.
