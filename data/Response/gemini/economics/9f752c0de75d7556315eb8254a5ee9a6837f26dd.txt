1. **Incorporate generator outages into the proposed framework.** The proposed framework currently ignores possible generator outages, which may lead to suboptimal dispatch and pricing results. Future research could extend the framework to incorporate generator outages, either through a probabilistic approach or a deterministic approach.
2. **Develop a more sophisticated reserve market design.** The proposed framework uses a simple reserve market design that does not consider the different types of reserves (e.g., spinning reserve, regulation reserve) or the different time scales of reserves (e.g., 5-minute reserves, 10-minute reserves). Future research could develop a more sophisticated reserve market design that takes these factors into account.
3. **Investigate the impact of the proposed framework on the reliability of the power system.** The proposed framework may have an impact on the reliability of the power system, as it changes the way that energy and reserve are dispatched and priced. Future research could investigate the impact of the proposed framework on the reliability of the power system, and develop mitigation strategies for any negative impacts.
4. **Develop a more efficient algorithm for solving the proposed model.** The proposed model is a large-scale optimization problem that can be computationally expensive to solve. Future research could develop a more efficient algorithm for solving the proposed model, which would make it more practical for use in real-world applications.
5. **Apply the proposed framework to a real-world power system.** The proposed framework has been tested on a small-scale test system, but it has not yet been applied to a real-world power system. Future research could apply the proposed framework to a real-world power system, and evaluate its performance in a real-world setting.
