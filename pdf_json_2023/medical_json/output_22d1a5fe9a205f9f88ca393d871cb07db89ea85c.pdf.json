    "abstractText": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the simulated saliva\u2013gastrointestinal digestion of AABP-2B on its structural features, inhibitory \u03b1-glucosidase activity, and human gut microbiota. The salivary\u2013gastrointestinal digestion results show that there is no significant change in the molecular weight of AABP-2B, and no free monosaccharides are released. This indicates that, under a simulated digestive condition, AABP-2B is not degraded and can be further utilized by gut microbiota. AABP-2B still possessed good inhibitory activity on \u03b1-glucosidase after salivary\u2013 gastrointestinal digestion, which may be attributed to the largely unchanged structural characteristics of AABP-2B after simulated digestion. Furthermore, in vitro fecal fermentation with AABP-2B after salivary\u2013gastrointestinal digestion showed that AABP-2B modulated the gut microbiota structure and increased the relative proportions of Prevotella, Faecalibacterium, and Megasphaera. AABP-2B can also modify the intestinal flora composition by inhibiting pathogen growth. Moreover, the AABP-2B group resulted in a significant increase in short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) content during fermentation. These findings demonstrate that AABP-2B can be used as a prebiotic or functional food to promote",

            "text": "Trillions of microbial cells are distributed in the human gastrointestinal tract, forming a large microbial ecosystem that plays an important role in human health, such as regulating intestinal endocrine function, preventing the excessive growth of pathogens, and promoting the maturation of host immune responses [1\u20133]. Conversely, an imbalance in the intestinal flora could induce several diseases, such as intestinal barrier disorders, diabetes, and liver disease [4]. In recent decades, the research exploring the link between gut microbiota and human health has rapidly progressed, generating significant interest from both the scientific community and general public. Thus, the gut microbiota has emerged as a promising target for improving human health and managing diseases. In addition to supplying the essential\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1965. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15081965 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1965 2 of 14\nnutrients for the human body, diet serves as a critical factor in maintaining the survival of trillions of gut microbiota. Consequently, dietary intake plays a key role in influencing the composition and function of the gut microbiota [5]. Dietary polysaccharides have been reported to resist to be digested in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and sequently enter the large intestine without causing dramatic structural changes. Consequently, the flora in the large intestine may utilize dietary polysaccharides to produce beneficial metabolites and regulate pH. Previous studies have reported that polysaccharides from okra [6] and loquat leaves [7] modulate the composition of the intestinal flora, particularly by promoting certain beneficial intestinal flora, such as Lactobacillus and Prevotella. Dietary polysaccharide intervention tends to transform the intestinal microbiota composition, and, concomitantly, the metabolites produced by this process contribute to the health of the host. Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge, also called Zhimu, has long been regarded as a functional food or Chinese herb in China in light of its beneficial biological properties, such as antioxidant, hypoglycaemic, and anti-inflammatory entities. Polysaccharides are important active ingredients of Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge and exhibit neuroprotective and hypoglycaemic activities [8]. Additionally, four types of hypoglycaemic glycans have been obtained from A. asphodeloides [9]. Our previous study isolated a polysaccharide (AABP-2B, 5800 Da) from A. asphodeloides, which mainly included (4,6)-\u03b2-D-Glcp-(1,3,6)D-Manp-(1,4)-\u03b2-D-Manp-(1) glycosidic linkages. AABP-2B not only possessed favourable \u03b1-glucosidase-inhibitory activity, but also clearly improved insulin resistance [10]. Postprandial hyperglycaemia is a common symptom of diabetes mellitus. Floris et al. [11] showed that inhibiting the activity of \u03b1-glucosidase could delay the conversion of dietary carbohydrates into glucose entering the bloodstream, thereby reducing postprandial hyperglycaemia. In addition, an increasing number of studies have shown that the aetiology or progression of T2DM is related to intestinal flora disorders. Unbalanced microbial communities can ultimately destroy the intestinal barrier function, resulting in insulin resistance and obesity [12,13]. Based on the structural characteristics of AABP-2B, it is thought that AABP-2B (a non-starch polysaccharide) may not be completely degraded by gastrointestinal digestion and enter the colon for fermentation by the intestinal flora. It has yet to be determined, however, whether AABP-2B still has an inhibitory effect on \u03b1-glucosidase [10] after encountering carbohydrate-hydrolysing enzymes and whether fermentation of AABP-2B by intestinal flora can benefit the host. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the simulated saliva\u2013 gastrointestinal digestion of AABP-2B on the structural features and inhibitory \u03b1-glucosidase activity. Furthermore, the effects of indigested AABP-2B on the intestinal flora and the production of SCFAs were studied using in vitro fermentation models. The results of this research will be helpful for better understanding the potential digestion and fermentation mechanism behind AABP-2B, providing a theoretical basis for its development and application in functional food."

Saliva is the primary digestive juice secreted after eating. The amylase activity of human saliva used in this study was measured to be 113 \u00b1 7 D units/mL, which is within the normal range of 18\u2013208 D units/mL [14]. The Mw of AABP-2B after simulated digestion was determined by HPGPC. As shown in Figure 1A, the molecular weight of AABP-2B does not change after 0.5 h of saliva digestion. In addition, free monosaccharides were not detected during digestion (Figure 2B), whereas the reducing sugar content (Figure 3) was not significantly altered, suggesting that AABP-2B cannot be degraded by saliva.

In Figure 1B,C, the molecular weight of AABP-2B did not undergo discernible changes during\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1965 7 of 14\ngastric or intestinal digestion. In addition, the changes in monosaccharide compositions of AABP-2B during digestion were investigated. As illustrated in Figure 2, no free monosaccharides were detected during in vitro digestion, indicating that AABP-2B was not digested to release monosaccharides. Moreover, the reducing sugar content of AABP-2B did not change significantly (p > 0.05) after the simulation of upper gastrointestinal digestion (Figure 3). These results show that AABP-2B was not digested by the gastric or smallintestinal environment and safely reached the colon. Similarly, the Mw of polysaccharides from Fuzhuan brick tea [17] and tamarind seeds [18] were observed no significant variation (p > 0.05) during gastric and small-intestinal digestions, which illustrated that these of polysaccharide were not hydrolysed under simulated digestion. However, some studies have shown that the Mw of polysaccharides from Ganoderma atrum [19] and Rosa Roxburghii Tratt [14] were significantly decreased under simulated digestion, indicating that some of these polysaccharide could be hydrolysed by simulating upper gastrointestinal fluid. The digestibility of polysaccharides is influenced by their structural characteristics (molecular weight, monosaccharide constituents, and glycosidic linkages) [14]. AABP-2B mainly included (4,6)-\u03b2-D-Glcp-(1,3,6)-D-Manp-(1,4)-\u03b2-D-Manp-(1) glycosidic linkages [10]. Figures 1 and 2 indicate that the carbohydrate hydrolysis enzymes in the saliva and upper gastrointestinal tract could not break down the glycosidic linkages of AABP-2B."

            "text": "We previously showed the good inhibitory \u03b1-glucosidase activity of AABP-2B [10]. Hence, the effects of simulating saliva\u2013gastrointestinal digestion on the \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory effects of AABP-2B were assessed in this study. As shown in Figure 4, the inhibitory effects of AABP-2B and digested AABP-2B on \u03b1-glucosidase increased with the increasing concentration. The IC50 values of digested AABP-2B and AABP-2B on \u03b1glucosidase inhibition were calculated to be 0.81\u00b1 0.13 and 0.84\u00b1 0.19 mg/mL, respectively. These findings demonstrate that saliva\u2013gastrointestinal digestion does not affect (p > 0.05) the \u03b1-glucosidase-inhibitory activity of AABP-2B, which may be attributed to the largely unchanged structural characteristics of AABP-2B after simulated digestion. \u03b1-Glucosidase is an exoenzyme in the intestinal epithelium that can hydrolyse oligosaccharides into glucose. Our results show that digested AABP-2B still possesses good \u03b1-glucosidaseinhibitory activity. Hence, the ingestion of AABP-2B may help inhibit glycosidase activity and prevent postprandial hyperglycaemia.\nNutrients\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n3.2.\u00a0Analysis\u00a0of\u00a0Inhibition\u00a0\u03b1\u2010Glucosidase\u00a0Activity\u00a0after\u00a0In\u00a0Vitro\u00a0Simulation\u00a0of\u00a0Digestion\u00a0 We\u00a0previously\u00a0showed\u00a0the\u00a0good\u00a0inhibitory\u00a0\u03b1-glucosidase\u00a0activity\u00a0of\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0[10].\u00a0 Hence,\u00a0the\u00a0effects\u00a0of\u00a0simulating\u00a0saliva\u2013gastrointestinal\u00a0digestion\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0\u03b1-glucosidase\u00a0inhibitory\u00a0effects\u00a0of\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0were\u00a0assessed\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0study.\u00a0As\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a04,\u00a0the\u00a0inhibitory\u00a0effects\u00a0of\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0and\u00a0digested\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0on\u00a0\u03b1-glucosidase\u00a0increased\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0increasing\u00a0concentration.\u00a0The\u00a0IC50\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0digested\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0and\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0on\u00a0\u03b1-glucosidase\u00a0 inhibition\u00a0were\u00a0calculated\u00a0 to\u00a0be\u00a00.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13\u00a0and\u00a00.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0mg/mL,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0 These\u00a0findings\u00a0demonstrate\u00a0that\u00a0saliva\u2013gastrointestinal\u00a0digestion\u00a0does\u00a0not\u00a0affect\u00a0(p\u00a0>\u00a00.05)\u00a0 the\u00a0\u03b1-glucosidase-inhibitory\u00a0activity\u00a0of\u00a0AABP-2B,\u00a0which\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0attributed\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0largely\u00a0 unchanged\u00a0structural\u00a0characteristics\u00a0of\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0after\u00a0simulated\u00a0digestion.\u00a0\u03b1-Glucosidase\u00a0 is\u00a0an\u00a0exoenzyme\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0intestinal\u00a0epithelium\u00a0that\u00a0can\u00a0hydrolyse\u00a0oligosaccharides\u00a0into\u00a0glucose.\u00a0Our\u00a0results\u00a0show\u00a0that\u00a0digested\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0still\u00a0possesses\u00a0good\u00a0\u03b1-glucosidase-inhibitory\u00a0activity.\u00a0Hence,\u00a0the\u00a0ingestion\u00a0of\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0may\u00a0help\u00a0inhibit\u00a0glycosidase\u00a0activity\u00a0and\u00a0 prevent\u00a0post randial\u00a0hyperglycaemia.\u00a0 \u00a0\n3.3.\u00a0Change\u00a0in\u00a0pH\u00a0 Indigestible\u00a0polysaccharides\u00a0 that\u00a0cannot\u00a0be\u00a0digested\u00a0by\u00a0gastric\u00a0or\u00a0 intestinal\u00a0fluids\u00a0 may\u00a0be\u00a0utilised\u00a0by\u00a0gut\u00a0flora\u00a0[20].\u00a0The\u00a0fermentation\u00a0process\u00a0of\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0reflected\u00a0 by\u00a0changes\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0pH\u00a0[21].\u00a0As\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a05,\u00a0the\u00a0pH\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0and\u00a0inulin\u00a0groups\u00a0 decreased\u00a0sharply\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a00\u201312\u00a0h,\u00a0but\u00a0only\u00a0slightly\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0subsequent\u00a012\u00a0h\u00a0of\u00a0 fermentation.\u00a0In\u00a0the\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0group,\u00a0the\u00a0pH\u00a0decreased\u00a0from\u00a06.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16\u00a0(0\u00a0h)\u00a0to\u00a05.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27\u00a0 (24\u00a0h),\u00a0which\u00a0was\u00a0much\u00a0lower\u00a0than\u00a0that\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0blank\u00a0group.\u00a0These\u00a0results\u00a0are\u00a0similar\u00a0to\u00a0 those\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0previous\u00a0study\u00a0on\u00a0loquat\u00a0leaf\u00a0polysaccharides\u00a0[7].\u00a0The\u00a0decrease\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0pH\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0 AABP-2B\u00a0and\u00a0inulin\u00a0groups\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0fact\u00a0that\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0and\u00a0inulin\u00a0act\u00a0as\u00a0carbon\u00a0 sources\u00a0that\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0utilized\u00a0by\u00a0gut\u00a0microbes.\u00a0The\u00a0bacterial\u00a0composition\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0altered\u00a0at\u00a0 lower\u00a0pH\u00a0levels\u00a0by\u00a0encouraging\u00a0the\u00a0proliferation\u00a0of\u00a0beneficial\u00a0bacteria\u00a0and\u00a0inhibiting\u00a0the\u00a0 multiplication\u00a0of\u00a0pathogenic\u00a0bacteria\u00a0[22].\u00a0\ni r . - l c si se-i i it r cti it f - ri s li str i testi l i esti .

The fermentation process of AABP-2B may be reflected by changes in the pH [21]. As shown in Figure 5, the pH of the AABP-2B and inulin groups decreased sharply during the first 0\u201312 h, but only slightly during the subsequent 12 h of fermentation. In the AABP-2B group, the pH decreased from 6.89 \u00b1 0.16 (0 h) to 5.12 \u00b1 0.27 (24 h), which was much lower than that of the blank group. These results are similar to those of a previous study on loquat leaf polysaccharides [7]. The decrease in the pH in the AABP-2B and inulin groups may be due to the fact that AABP-2B and inulin act as carbon sources that can be utilized by gut microbes. The bacterial composition may be altered at lower pH levels by encouraging the proliferation of beneficial bacteria and inhibiting the multiplication of pathogenic bacteria [22].

As shown in Figure 6F, the SCFAs\u2019 concentration in the AABP-2B group increased profoundly from 1.20 \u00b1 0.31 (0 h) to 32.40 \u00b1 1.14 mmol/L (24 h). Acetic, n-butyric, and propionic acids were the dominant metabolic products in the colon (Figure 6A,D). The propionic acid content in the AABP-2B group increased from 0.44 \u00b1 0.13 (0 h) to 16.63 \u00b1 0.43 mmol/L (24 h) (Figure 6B). Moreover, the contents of n-butyric and acetic acids considerably increased compared with those in the blank group. Acetate suppresses appetite via the central hypothalamus [23]. Propionic acid is absorbed by the colon, metabolised by the liver to participate in gluconeogenesis, and used as energy. Butyrate, a significant substrate for maintaining the colonic epithelium, not only has anti-inflammatory effects, but also provides energy for colon cells [24,25]. Thus, AABP-2B may be digested by intestinal microorganisms to form beneficial compounds (SCFAs).\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1965 9 of 14Nutrients\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 10\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a06.\u00a0SCFA\u00a0concentrations\u00a0of\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0during\u00a0fermentation:\u00a0(A)\u00a0acetic\u00a0acid;\u00a0(B)\u00a0propionic\u00a0acid;\u00a0\n(C)\u00a0isobutyric\u00a0acid;\u00a0(D)\u00a0n-butyric\u00a0acid;\u00a0(E)\u00a0n-pentanoic\u00a0acid;\u00a0and\u00a0(F)\u00a0total\u00a0content.\u00a0Statistically\u00a0signif-\nicant\u00a0differences\u00a0were\u00a0observed\u00a0between\u00a0different\u00a0letters\u00a0(p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).\u00a0\n3.5.\u00a0In\u00a0Vitro\u00a0Fermentation\u00a0of\u00a0AABP\u20102B\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0Intestinal\u00a0Flora\u00a0 As\u00a0a\u00a0carbon\u00a0source,\u00a0polysaccharides\u00a0can\u00a0provide\u00a0energy\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0intestinal\u00a0flora\u00a0and\u00a0 promote\u00a0its\u00a0growth,\u00a0thereby\u00a0altering\u00a0the\u00a0diversity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0intestinal\u00a0microecology\u00a0[26].\u00a0The\u00a0 sequencing\u00a0of\u00a016S\u00a0ribosomal\u00a0RNA\u00a0was\u00a0conducted\u00a0to\u00a0investigate\u00a0the\u00a0influence\u00a0of\u00a0AABP2B\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0intestinal\u00a0flora\u00a0during\u00a0in\u00a0vitro\u00a0fermentation.\u00a0A\u00a0total\u00a0of\u00a08364\u00a0raw\u00a0reads\u00a0were\u00a0obtained\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0sequence\u00a0optimisation\u00a0of\u00a030\u00a0samples\u00a0(10\u00a0groups,\u00a0each\u00a0repeated\u00a0three\u00a0times).\u00a0 As\u00a0illustrated\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a07A,\u00a0the\u00a0Shannon\u00a0index\u00a0curve\u00a0initially\u00a0rose\u00a0dramatically\u00a0and\u00a0then\u00a0 reached\u00a0a\u00a0plateau,\u00a0indicating\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0sequencing\u00a0data\u00a0volume\u00a0was\u00a0large\u00a0enough\u00a0to\u00a0reflect\u00a0 the\u00a0biological\u00a0information\u00a0per\u00a0sample.\u00a0Figure\u00a07B\u00a0shows\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0rank\u00a0abundance\u00a0curves\u00a0 for\u00a0each\u00a0sample\u00a0species\u00a0are\u00a0rich\u00a0and\u00a0uniform.\u00a0A\u00a0high\u00a0level\u00a0of\u00a0alpha\u00a0diversity\u00a0indicates\u00a0that\u00a0 each\u00a0community\u2019s\u00a0microbial\u00a0wealth\u00a0and\u00a0uniformity\u00a0were\u00a0reflected\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0sequencing\u00a0data.\u00a0 Moreover,\u00a0the\u00a0coverage\u00a0rate\u00a0for\u00a0each\u00a0sample\u00a0was\u00a0over\u00a099.87%,\u00a0suggesting\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0data\u00a0 analysis\u00a0was\u00a0reasonable\u00a0(Figure\u00a07C).\u00a0"

            "text": "As a carbon source, polysaccharides can provide energy to the intestinal flora and promote its growth, thereby altering the diversity of the intestinal microecology [26]. The sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA was conducted to investigate the influence of AABP-2B on the intestinal flora during in vitro fermentation. A total of 8364 raw reads were obtained by the sequence optimisation of 30 samples (10 groups, each repeated three times). As illustrated in Figure 7A, the Shannon index curve initially rose dramatically and then reached a plateau, indicating that the sequencing data volume was large enough to reflect the biological information per sample. Figure 7B shows that the rank abundance curves for each sample species are rich and uniform. A high level of alpha diversity indicates that each community\u2019s microbial wealth and uniformity were reflected in the sequencing data. Moreover, the coverage rate for each sample was over 99.87%, suggesting that the data analysis was reasonable (Figure 7C). Principal component analysis (PCA) plots and hierarchical clustering trees were used to evaluate the differences in microbial composition between samples. After 24 h of fermentation, there was a distinct separation between the four groups (OR, BLK, AABP-2B, and IN), with the first two axes, accounting for 88.19% of the difference between groups (Figure 8A). On PC1 (the first-principal component), compared to the BLK group, the distance between the AABP-2B and IN groups was small, indicating that AABP-2B and IN similarly affected the gut microbiota. Moreover, the cluster analysis results (Figure 8B) are\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1965 10 of 14\nin accordance with the PCA results, illustrating that AABP-2B and IN have similar impacts on the gut microbiota.\nNutrients\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 11\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a07.\u00a0Shannon\u00a0(A),\u00a0rank\u00a0abundance\u00a0(B),\u00a0and\u00a0coverage\u00a0curves\u00a0for\u00a0each\u00a0treatment\u00a0group\u00a0(C).\u00a0\nPrincipal\u00a0component\u00a0analysis\u00a0(PCA)\u00a0plots\u00a0and\u00a0hierarchical\u00a0clustering\u00a0trees\u00a0were\u00a0used\u00a0 to\u00a0evaluate\u00a0the\u00a0differences\u00a0in\u00a0microbial\u00a0composition\u00a0between\u00a0samples.\u00a0After\u00a024\u00a0h\u00a0of\u00a0fermentation,\u00a0there\u00a0was\u00a0a\u00a0distinct\u00a0separation\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0four\u00a0groups\u00a0(OR,\u00a0BLK,\u00a0AABP-2B,\u00a0 and\u00a0IN),\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0two\u00a0axes,\u00a0accounting\u00a0for\u00a088.19%\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0difference\u00a0between\u00a0groups\u00a0 (Figure\u00a08A).\u00a0On\u00a0PC1\u00a0(the\u00a0first-principal\u00a0component),\u00a0compared\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0BLK\u00a0group,\u00a0the\u00a0distance\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0and\u00a0IN\u00a0groups\u00a0was\u00a0small,\u00a0indicating\u00a0that\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0and\u00a0IN\u00a0 similarly\u00a0affected\u00a0the\u00a0gut\u00a0microbiota.\u00a0Moreover,\u00a0the\u00a0cluster\u00a0analysis\u00a0results\u00a0(Figure\u00a08B)\u00a0are\u00a0 in\u00a0accordance\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0PCA\u00a0results,\u00a0illustrating\u00a0that\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0and\u00a0IN\u00a0have\u00a0similar\u00a0impacts\u00a0 on\u00a0the\u00a0gut\u00a0microbiota.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a08.\u00a0OTU-level\u00a0PCA\u00a0of\u00a0gut\u00a0microbiota;\u00a0(A)\u00a0hierarchical\u00a0clustering\u00a0tree\u00a0on\u00a0OUT\u00a0level\u00a0(B).\u00a0\nAt\u00a0the\u00a0phylum\u00a0level\u00a0(Figure\u00a09),\u00a0Bacteroidetes,\u00a0Actinobacteria,\u00a0Proteobacteria,\u00a0and\u00a0Firmic\u2010 utes\u00a0were\u00a0the\u00a0main\u00a0microbial\u00a0flora\u00a0in\u00a0all\u00a0samples,\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0consistent\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0previous\u00a0report\u00a0 [27].\u00a0 In\u00a0 the\u00a0AABP-2B-24\u00a0and\u00a0 IN-24\u00a0groups,\u00a0Firmicutes\u00a0and\u00a0Bacteroidetes\u00a0were\u00a0more\u00a0 abundant\u00a0than\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0BLK-24\u00a0group,\u00a0whereas\u00a0Proteobacteria\u00a0were\u00a0less\u00a0abundant.\u00a0In\u00a0the\u00a0 colon,\u00a0Firmicutes\u00a0can\u00a0ferment\u00a0non-starch\u00a0polysaccharides\u00a0into\u00a0butyrate,\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0beneficial\u00a0\nFigure 7.

OTU-level PCA of gut microbiota; (A) hierarchical clustering tree on OUT level (B).\nAt the phylum level (Figure 9), Bacteroidet s, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes were the main microbial flora in all samples, which is consistent with a previous report [27]. In the AABP-2B-24 and IN-24 groups, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were more abundant than in the BLK-24 group, whereas Proteobacteria wer less abundant. In the colon, Firmicutes can ferment non-starch polysaccharides into butyrate, which is beneficial to the host [28]. Moreover, Bacteroidetes contain a number of carbohydrate-active enzymes capable of metabolising polysaccharides, which may have the beneficial effect of promoting the growth of other gut flora [28]. Proteobacteria are one of the most diverse flora containing not only anaerobic bacteria, but also a certain number of aerobic bacteria [29,30]. After fermentation for 6 h, the abundance of Proteob cteri in th BLK, AABP-2B, and IN groups increased significantly from 2.74% (0 h) to 33.88%, 12.03%, and 7.65%, respectively. However, after 24 h of fermentation, the abundance of Proteobacteria in he BLK, AABP-2B, and IN groups decreased significantly to 10.21%, 3.69%, and 5.71%, r spectively. This may be\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1965 11 of 14\nbecause, although the anaerobic conditions were strictly controlled during the entire fermentation process, there may have been trace amounts of oxygen in the initial fermentation process, which promoted the proliferation of aerobic Proteobacteria [31]. However, with increasing the fermentation time, trace oxygen was depleted and the content of Proteobacteria in each group also significantly decreased, indicating that the entire fermentation experiment maintained good anaerobic conditions. In addition, Proteobacteria comprise many pathogenic bacteria, such as Shigella, Salmonella, Escherichia, and Campylobacter, which may result in chronic colitis and inflammation [30]. Compared with the BLK-24 group, the abundance of Proteobacteria in the AABP-2B-24 group was significantly lower, indicating that AABP-2B could inhibit the proliferation of Proteobacteria, which is beneficial to the health of the host.\nNutrients\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 12\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0

In comparison to the blank group, the abundance of bacteria was very different after fermentation with AABP-2B and inulin, suggesting that fermentation with AABP-2B and inulin had a profound influence on the intestinal flora. Moreov r, the relative abundanc s of Megasphaera, Lactobacillus, Megamonas, Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Faecalibacterium were greatly increased in the AABP-2B group fter 24 h of fermentation, whil the relative amounts of Escherichia-Shigella, Blautia, Dialister, Fusobacterium, an Romboutsia were significantly reduced. The abundance of Bacteroides significantly increased after AABP-2B fermentation, possibly because of their ability to degrade and utilise carbohydrates, thereby promoting their proliferation [32]. Moreover, Bacteroides have a therapeutic effect on obesity-related metabolic and immune system disorders [25,33]. Faecalibacterium, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, has anti-inflammatory properties and is beneficial to the host [34]. In addition, Megasphaera and Faecalibacterium may ferment polysaccharides to produce butyrate, which provides energy to colonic epithelial cells and inhibits inflammation [35,36]. After 24 h of fermentation, the AABP-2B group exhibited a higher abundance of Faecalibacterium than the blank group. The increase in Faecalibacterium was also consistent with the SCFAs results; the butyric acid content in the AABP-2B group was much higher than that in the blank group. In addition, the relative amount of Prevotella in the AABP-2B and inulin groups was higher than that in the blank group, indicating that AABP-2B and inulin significantly promote Prevotella growth during in vitro fermentation. Previous studies have shown that a high-fibre diet is closely associated with an increase in Prevotella, which may degrade polysaccharides and use fermentation products to promote Prevotella [37].\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1965 12 of 14\nKovatcheva-Datchary et al. observed that an increase in Prevotella can promote glycogen storage in some populations and prevent glucose intolerance [33]. Therefore, an in&in Prevotella in the intestinal flora may reduce the risk of diabetes.\nNutrients\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 13\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nbeneficial\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0host\u00a0[34].\u00a0In\u00a0addition,\u00a0Megasphaera\u00a0and\u00a0Faecalibacterium\u00a0may\u00a0ferment\u00a0polysaccharides\u00a0to\u00a0produce\u00a0butyrate,\u00a0which\u00a0provides\u00a0energy\u00a0to\u00a0colonic\u00a0epithelial\u00a0cells\u00a0and\u00a0 inhibits\u00a0inflammation\u00a0[35,36].\u00a0After\u00a024\u00a0h\u00a0of\u00a0fermentation,\u00a0the\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0group\u00a0exhibited\u00a0a\u00a0 higher\u00a0abundance\u00a0of\u00a0Faecalibacterium\u00a0than\u00a0the\u00a0blank\u00a0group.\u00a0The\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0Faecalibacte\u2010 rium\u00a0was\u00a0also\u00a0consistent\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0SCFAs\u00a0results;\u00a0the\u00a0butyric\u00a0acid\u00a0content\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0 group\u00a0was\u00a0much\u00a0higher\u00a0than\u00a0that\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0blank\u00a0group.\u00a0In\u00a0addition,\u00a0the\u00a0relative\u00a0amount\u00a0of\u00a0 Prevotella\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0and\u00a0inulin\u00a0groups\u00a0was\u00a0higher\u00a0than\u00a0that\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0blank\u00a0group,\u00a0indicating\u00a0that\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0and\u00a0inulin\u00a0significantly\u00a0promote\u00a0Prevotella\u00a0growth\u00a0during\u00a0in\u00a0vitro\u00a0 fermentation.\u00a0Previous\u00a0studies\u00a0have\u00a0shown\u00a0that\u00a0a\u00a0high-fibre\u00a0diet\u00a0is\u00a0closely\u00a0associated\u00a0with\u00a0 an\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0Prevotella,\u00a0which\u00a0may\u00a0degrade\u00a0polysaccharides\u00a0and\u00a0use\u00a0fermentation\u00a0products\u00a0to\u00a0promote\u00a0Prevotella\u00a0[37].\u00a0Kovatcheva-Datchary\u00a0et\u00a0al.\u00a0observed\u00a0that\u00a0an\u00a0 increase\u00a0 in\u00a0 Prevotella\u00a0can\u00a0promote\u00a0glycogen\u00a0storage\u00a0in\u00a0some\u00a0populations\u00a0and\u00a0prevent\u00a0glucose\u00a0intolerance\u00a0[33].\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0an\u00a0in&in\u00a0Prevotella\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0intestinal\u00a0flora\u00a0may\u00a0reduce\u00a0the\u00a0risk\u00a0of\u00a0diabetes.\u00a0\nminant\u00a0analysis\u00a0effect\u00a0size\u00a0(LefSe)\u00a0analysis\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0comparison\u00a0of\u00a0gut\u00a0microbiota\u00a0among\u00a0OR,\u00a0BLK,\u00a0\nAABP-2B,\u00a0and\u00a0IN\u00a0control\u00a0group\u00a0(B).\u00a0OR,\u00a0original\u00a0faeces\u00a0group;\u00a0BLK,\u00a0without-carbon-source\u00a0group;\u00a0\nAABP-2B,\u00a0indigestible\u00a0A.\u00a0asphodeloides\u00a0polysaccharide\u00a0(AABP-2B)-treatment\u00a0group;\u00a0IN,\u00a0inulin-treat-\nment\u00a0group.\u00a0\nMoreover,\u00a0 the\u00a0 relative\u00a0 amount\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 opportunistic\u00a0pathogen,\u00a0Escherichia\u2010Shigella,\u00a0 was\u00a0reduced\u00a0substantially\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0group\u00a0compared\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0blank\u00a0group.\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0may\u00a0alter\u00a0 the\u00a0composition\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0 intestinal\u00a0flora\u00a0by\u00a0 inhibiting\u00a0pathogen\u00a0 growth.\u00a0In\u00a0conclusion,\u00a0Anemarrhena\u00a0polysaccharides\u00a0(AABP-2B)\u00a0stimulate\u00a0the\u00a0multiplication\u00a0of\u00a0probiotics\u00a0and\u00a0 inhibit\u00a0 the\u00a0growth\u00a0of\u00a0pathogenic\u00a0bacteria,\u00a0 thus\u00a0maintaining\u00a0host\u00a0 health.\u00a0\n4.\u00a0Conclusions\u00a0 In\u00a0general,\u00a0the\u00a0results\u00a0show\u00a0that\u00a0during\u00a0digestion,\u00a0the\u00a0molecular\u00a0weight\u00a0of\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0 does\u00a0not\u00a0change\u00a0significantly,\u00a0and\u00a0there\u00a0is\u00a0no\u00a0monosaccharide\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0digestive\u00a0juice.\u00a0These\u00a0 results\u00a0indicate\u00a0that\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0is\u00a0stable\u00a0under\u00a0simulated\u00a0digestion\u00a0conditions\u00a0and\u00a0can\u00a0enter\u00a0 the\u00a0large\u00a0intestine\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0utilized\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0intestinal\u00a0flora.\u00a0Moreover,\u00a0after\u00a0salivary\u2013gastrointestinal\u00a0digestion,\u00a0AABP-2B\u00a0still\u00a0possessed\u00a0good\u00a0\u03b1-glucosidase\u00a0inhibitory\u00a0activity.\u00a0During\u00a0\nMoreover, the relative amount of the opportunist c pathogen, Escherichia-Shigella, was reduced substantially n the AABP-2B group compared with e blank group.

            "text": "In general, the results show that during digestion, the molecular weight of AABP2B does not chang significantly, and there is no monosaccharide in the digestive juice. These results indicate th t AABP-2B is stable u der simulated digestion conditions and can enter the large intestine to be utilized by the intestinal flora. Moreover, after salivary\u2013 gastrointestinal digestion, AABP-2B still possessed good \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity. During AABP-2B fermentation, the pH decreased significantly, whereas total SCFAs, including propionic, acetic, and n-butyric acids, significantly increased. Therefore, it is speculated that the changes in SCFAs may be related to the fermentation of AABP-2B by intestinal flora. Additionally, AABP-2B modified the composition of the intestinal flora by increasing the relative amounts of beneficial bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, and Megasphaera. Furthermore, AABP-2B can alter the gut microbiota composition by inhibiting the growth of pathogens. Thus, AABP-2B may be used as a prebiotic or functional food to improve gut health. Meanwhile, there were certain limitations to this study. As in vitro studies are inherently different from in vivo research, the findings presented herein cannot be directly correlated with biological responses. In the future, we will conduct animal experiments to further investigate the effects of the in vivo digestion and hydrolysis of AAB-2B on the intestinal microbiota and metabolites.\nNutrients 2023, 15, 1965 13 of 14\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.C., L.L. and B.L.; Methodology, M.L.; Software, X.Z., W.J. and Z.C.; Formal analysis, W.J.; Investigation, J.C.; Data curation, X.Z. and Z.C.; Writing\u2014original draft, M.L.; Writing\u2014review & editing, B.L.; Visualization, L.L. and B.L.; Project administration, J.C.
