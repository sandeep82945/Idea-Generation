We aim to study any possible correlation that might exist between the magnetic fields orientation inside the clouds and the magnetic fields at envelope scales and their connection with respect to the observed morphology of the selected clouds. We examine the magnetic field orientation towards the clouds L1512, L1523, L1333, L1521E, L1544, L1517, L1780 and L183 using optical and Planck polarization observations. We also found the correlation between the ambient magnetic field and core orientations derived using Astrodendrogram on the Herschel 250 \u03bcm data. We find that the magnetic fields derived from optical and Planck agree with each other. The derived magnetic fields are aligned along the observed emission of each cloud as seen in Herschel 250 \u03bcm data. We also find that the relative orientation between the cores and the magnetic fields is random. This lack of correlation may arise due to the fact that the core orientation could also be influenced by the different magnetization within individual clouds at higher densities or the feedback effects which may vary from cloud to cloud. The estimated magnetic field strength and the mass-to-flux ratio suggest that all the clouds are in a magnetically critical state except L1333, L1521E and L183 where the cloud envelope could be strongly supported by the magnetic field lines.",

            "text": "In molecular clouds, the filamentary structures are ubiquitous and some of them are believed to be created by compression of material due to multi-scale supersonic flows (Alves et al. 2014). Localised density enhancements will shrink under self-gravity to form prestellar cores where stars form through collapsing gas motions (Shu et al. 1987). These prestellar cores are the preferential and ideal sites of star formation in nearby dark clouds like the Taurus and the Perseus (Ward-Thompson et al. 1994; Hatchell et al. 2005). Previous studies based on the optical inspection of the Palomar sky plate and molecular line observations in NH3 and N2H+ showed that the dense cores are typically of size \u223c 0.1 pc and contain a few solar mass of subsonic material at temperatures of \u223c 10 K and with an average volume density \u223c 104 cm\u22123 (Myers & Benson 1983; Benson & Myers 1983). The correlation of dense core positions with the locations of highly embedded young stellar objects (YSOs) led to an idea that some cores are forming stars currently or some of them have initiated such formation very recently. On the basis of association of YSO or IRAS point source, the cores are broadly divided into two categories: prestellar and protostellar. The morphology of their emission can be observed in dust continum and molecular line observa-\n? E-mail: ektasharma.astro@gmail.com\ntions. The results from the Herschel Gould Belt survey suggest that the cores are mostly being embedded in the filaments (Andr\u00e9 et al. 2010; Klessen & Hennebelle 2010; Alves et al. 2014). The association is consistent with the theoretical prediction that the thermally supercritical filaments experience a longitudinal fragmentation into cores (Inutsuka & Miyama 1992).\nThe significance of magnetic fields in the star formation process has been a subject of debate (e.g., Crutcher 2012; Li et al. 2014). It is widely believed that the magnetic fields along with the other physical factors like turbulence and gravity are the key factors affecting the star formation process at different scales and different evolutionary stages (Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2007; McKee & Ostriker 2007). The magnetic fields can regulate the gravitational contraction of the cloud at higher densities (n \u2265 103 cm\u22123) thus providing evidence of the field lines being dynamically important (Li et al. 2011). Several studies have been carried out to understand the dynamical importance of magnetic fields (Alves et al. 2008; Sugitani et al. 2010; Commer\u00e7on et al. 2011; Palau et al. 2013; Neha et al. 2016; Soam et al. 2018; Sharma et al. 2020).\nThe cloud-scale magnetic field at the lower densities can affect the compression in turbulence-induced shocks and channel the flows towards the high density regions (Heyer et al. 2008; Chen & Ostriker 2015). The core-scale magnetic field regulates the gas dynamics within the cores by removing angular momentum in collapsing cores and flattening the cores through the mechanism of ambipolar\n\u00a9 2015 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n01 50\n9v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .G\nA ]\n3 S\nep 2\ndiffusion. The correlation between the magnetic fields in the dense cores and the core orientation has been studied in various starless and star-forming regions (Ward-Thompson et al. 2000; Kirk et al. 2006). The magnetic fields at the intermediate scales connecting the large scale magnetic field to the field within cores can have a significant effect on their dynamics and the structure. Using the Planck polarization observations, Li et al. (2017) suggested a bimodal distribution in the alignment between the elongation of cloud (direction of major axes) and the direction of magnetic field using the Planck observations indicating that the alignment is more likely either parallel or perpendicular. Their study found the magnetic field as a primary regulator of the star formation rate. When the overall cloud evolves as a consequence of internal dynamics and stellar feedback effects, the clumps will also grow by accreting material turning into a non-spherical structures (Chen & Ostriker 2014, 2018; Kudoh & Basu 2011). Hence, clump shapes and orientation might be an indicator of formation mechanism. As a result of the interaction between magnetic field and core material through well defined orientation, the collapse may get inhibited and will result in reducing the star formation rate (Basu & Mouschovias 1995; Nakamura & Li 2011; Bailey et al. 2017). Therefore, it is crucial to explore the effect of large-scale magnetic field orientation on the morphology of dense core structures.\nObservational studies were conducted by Poidevin et al. (2014) on the cores extracted from 350 \u00b5m Herschel observations to investigate the core orientations in the Lupus I cloud with respect to the large-scale magnetic field. The environment plays an important role in shaping the prestellar cores through ram pressure and magnetic pressure (Chen & Ostriker 2018). Cores are usually either oblate or prolate shaped structures as suggested by MHD simulations (Chen & Ostriker 2018; Banerjee et al. 2009). There are anisotropic gas flows along the magnetic field lines during the formation and evolution of cores which lead to the preferential orientation of the cores along the background magnetic field lines (Chen & Ostriker 2014, 2015). Chen et al. (2020), by combining simulations and observational results from the archive, studied a sample of cores in three clouds and investigated whether there is any systematic relation between the core orientation and the cloud-scale magnetic field. They found that the correlation has a regional dependence on the individual magnetic properties of the clouds. Optical polarization of starlight is used as a technique to trace the plane-of-sky magnetic field geometry which typically works in regions of low extinction (AV \u223c1-3) (Goodman et al. 1990). Thus, optical polarimetry is mainly applicable towards the low density parts of the clouds. This is because the non-spherical dust grains which are believed to be aligned with their major axes perpendicular to the magnetic field cause selective extinction making the starlight polarized. At higher extinctions, the background starlight gets extinguished completely making it impossible to measure any polarization (e.g., Hiltner 1949; Vrba et al. 1976; Goodman et al. 1990; Alves et al. 2008; Soam et al. 2013). The polarized thermal dust emission is used as a technique to trace the plane-of-sky magnetic field geometry of regions with high obscurations (Ward-Thompson et al. 2009). This is because the nonspherical dust grains that are believed to be aligned with their major axes perpendicular to the magnetic field emit the radiation which is polarized in a direction parallel to the major axis of the dust grains. The all-sky maps of polarized emission from dust using the Planck satellite at 353 GHz gives a useful insight into the Galactic magnetic field in the star-forming regions (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016).\nIn this paper, we present results of a study conducted on eight clouds that are found to manifest their physical appearance in the form of sharp edges on one side and an extended diffuse emis-\nsion of material on the opposite side of the clouds. The possible reasons behind this morphological emission could be the isotropic interstellar radiation field (ISRF) or the heating effect from nearby stars which may have interacted with the cloud material during the process of their evolution (Nielbock et al. 2012; Nutter et al. 2009; Launhardt et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2016). In Fig. 1, we show the fields contained the clouds using the Herschel 250 \u00b5m SPIRE images of L1512, L1521E, L1517, L1544, L1780 and L183. The fields containing L1523 and L1333 are shown using the Dobashi extinction maps since there is no Herschel data available for them. The naming convention for the clouds given here are used to represent the whole cloud as shown in Fig. 1. The white solid contours drawn on the images reveal the emission morphology of the clouds. Basic information of these eight clouds are given in columns 1-5 of Table 2.\nThe questions that we are trying to investigate are the following: What is the relationship between the magnetic field orientations inside the clouds inferred from the Planck polarization and the envelope-field inferred from the optical polarization measurements of background starlight? What is the relationship between the magnetic field orientation with respect to the elongated morphology of the whole cloud? How the core major axes are oriented with respect to both inside and outside magnetic field directions? This paper is organised in the following manner. We begin with the observations and the data reduction. Then, we present results from our R-band polarization measurements and describe the procedure adapted to extract the cores in each cloud. We discussed our main results for each cloud on magnetic field geometry, strength and conclude the results with a summary in last section."

The polarization measurements were done in the standard Johnson R-band filter. The details on the polarization measurements of clouds L1780 and L183 are given in Neha et al. (2016). Table 1 shows the log of the observations for all six clouds. The AIMPOL has a combination of an achromatic half-wave plate (HWP) modulator and a Wollaston prism in form of a beam splitter. It splits the incoming light into two rays - ordinary (Io) and extra-ordinary (Ie). The observations were made at \u03bbe f f = 0.63 \u00b5m. The plate scale of the CCD is 1.48 \u2032\u2032 /pixel and the field of view is \u223c8\u2032 in diameter which covers 325\u00d7325 pixel2 area on the CCD. The full width at half-maximum of the stellar image varies from 2.9 \u2032\u2032 to 4.4 \u2032\u2032 (2-3 pixels) due to seeing of the atmosphere. The read-out noise and gain of CCD are 7.0 e\u22121 and 11.98 e\u22121/ADU, respectively.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201319 (2015)\nThe standard aperture photometry available in the IRAF package was used to extract the fluxes of ordinary (Io) and extraordinary (Ie) images of all the observed sources with a good signal-to-noise ratio. The ratio R(\u03b1) is given by,\nR(\u03b1) = Ie(\u03b1) Io(\u03b1) \u2212 1\nIe(\u03b1) Io(\u03b1)\n+ 1 = P cos(2\u03b8 \u2212 4\u03b1), (1)\nwhere P (%) is the fraction of the total linearly polarized light, \u03b8 is the polarization angle in the plane-of-sky and the \u03b1 is the position angle of the fast axis of the half-wave plate with respect to the axis of the Wollaston prism. The P and \u03b8 are calculated using the combination of the normalized stokes parameters q1, u1 and q2, u2 at angles 0\u25e6, 22.5\u25e6, 45\u25e6, 67.5\u25e6, respectively.\nInstrumental polarization was evaluated by observing zeropolarization standard stars during every observation run. The typical instrumental polarization is found to be of the order of \u223c0.1% (Soam et al. 2013, 2015; Neha et al. 2016). The reference direction of the polarizer was determined by observing polarized standard stars taken from Schmidt et al. (1992). The zero point correction in the polarization angle was derived using the offset obtained between the position value obtained in our observations and the standard position angles given in Schmidt et al. (1992)."

            "text": "The magnetic field geometry of a cloud is traced using the polarisation measurements of the stars that are background to the cloud. With the Gaia EDR3 data, we can ascertain whether the projected stars for which we have polarization measurements are foreground or background to the molecular clouds. If the observed star is background, the starlight will pass through the cloud and the asymmetric dust grains present in the clouds that are aligned with their minor axis parallel to the ambient magnetic field interact with the starlight. The starlight becomes polarized due to selective extinction and the polarization position angle gives the orientation of the projected magnetic field which is a projected component of the magnetic field in the plane of the sky (Davis & Greenstein 1951; Lazarian 2007). We obtained the distances of the stars having R-band polarization measurements from the Bailer-Jones et al. (2021) catalogue by making a search around each star with a search radius of 1\u2032\u2032. For the majority of the stars, we obtained a GAIA EDR3 counterpart well within our search radius. The Pop% vs. distance plot for the stars observed by us are presented in Fig. 3. For all the eight clouds, almost all the observed stars are found to lie beyond the distances quoted in column 4 of Table 2. This implies that the \u03b8op obtained from the R-band polarization measurements are tracing the projected component of the magnetic fields of the clouds in the plane of the sky. For the reason that all the eight clouds are located very close to us (. 200 pc), we did not correct for any foreground contribution to the measured polarization. In this context, previous magnetic field studies by Soam et al. (2017, 2018) also reported no significant change in the polarization properties due to line-of-sight contribution for the clouds which are at distances closer than 500 pc.\nThe projected magnetic field geometries traced by the R-band polarization results (BR) are presented on the Herschel 250 \u00b5m images containing the clouds L1512, L1523, L1333, L1521E, L1517,\nL1544, L1780 and L183 in Fig. 4. Since L1523 and L1333 were not observed with the Herschel telescope, we overplotted the polarization results on the Dobashi extinction map for these clouds as shown in Fig. 1 (second and third panel). The values of \u03b8op that are less than twice the standard deviation about the mean are plotted in the respective panels of Fig. 4 using the lines drawn in cyan and those greater than twice that value are shown using the lines drawn in green. The projected magnetic field traced using the Planck polarization vectors (BPlk) are represented using the vectors drawn in yellow in all the panels of Fig. 4. The length of the vectors corresponds to the values of Pop and the direction corresponds to the \u03b8op measured from the north increasing towards the east.\nThe optical polarization traces the field lines towards the outer low-density regions of the cloud along particular line-of-sight (Franco et al. 2010; Sugitani et al. 2011; Saha et al. 2021) and the Planck polarization is more efficient in tracing the field orientations towards the denser parts of the cloud (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016). Therefore, ideally we should use R-band polarization measurements to trace magnetic field geometry towards the low-density extended regions of the eight clouds studied here and the Planck polarization measurements to trace the field lines towards the highdensity cores of the clouds. However, as can be seen from the Fig. 4, the R-band polarization measurements are for sources that are located around the immediate neighbourhood of the clouds while the Planck polarization measurements are available for the full extent of the clouds. It is worth noticing here that the sizes of the dense cores are typically \u223c3-4\u2032 and the resolution of Planck data we used here is \u223c 8 arcmin. Therefore, the Planck data traces the large-scale magnetic field towards the centre of the core, not the core scale magnetic fields. Since the polarized emission from dust grains given by Planck data is weighted by column density (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016) and we have considered the mean Planck polarization angle as the average of nearest vectors within an 8 arcmin region around the core centre, the \u03b8plk still represents the large scale magnetic fields around the core in this paper. The advantage of using the R-band polarization of the stars is that as we know the distances of the individual stars and the majority of those stars towards all the eight clouds are located at the background, we are certain that the measured polarization is actually due to the dust grains belonging to the cloud and hence traces the field geometry towards the clouds. Thus, the projected magnetic field directions traced by the R-band polarization measurements can be compared with those from the Planck measurements towards the low-density outer regions of the cloud. This is because the polarization detected in R-band is caused by the dust grains due to selective absorption which also emit thermally and causes the polarization detected by the Planck. Hence the polarization measurements made in the R-band and the Planck should be consistent towards the low-density parts of the cloud. Such agreements between the polarization measurements made in the optical and in the sub- or milli-meter wavelengths are seen in other studies also (e.g., Ward-Thompson et al. 2009; Soler et al. 2016; Gu & Li 2019). In addition to this, since polarization in R-band gives field geometry with relatively higher spatial resolution in comparison to the Planck polarization measurements, the R-band results are used to examine field distortions at smaller scales. Below we discuss the results obtained for individual clouds."

The orientations of the BR and the BPlk are in excellent agreement (both showing an orientation of 158\u25e6). The consistency of the BR and the BPlk is even higher when we compare the \u03b8op within two standard deviation about the mean as shown by the vectors drawn in cyan. Since the optical polarization traces the field lines towards the outer low-density regions of the cloud and the Planck polarization is more efficient in tracing the field orientations towards the denser parts of the cloud, the agreement seen here suggests that the cloud is threaded by the same magnetic field from outer low-density medium to the high density regions of L1512. The projected field is aligned along the morphology of the cloud which is elongated in the northern direction. There is a curvature in the field lines along the northwest and southeast direction. The field lines are found to be tracing the two filaments seen to the western parts of the cloud. The degree of polarization (measured from both R-band and the Planck) is relatively lower towards the region with sharp edges as compared to the diffuse region on the opposite side. This could be due to the lack of aligned dust grains which may happen due to different grain size distribution or collisional disalignment with the gas (Soam et al. 2021). It could also be due to a tangled magnetic field causing depolarization (Planck Collaboration et al. 2015). The other reason might be\nthat the magnetic field lines could be bending along the line of sight with a smaller component projected in the plane-of-the-sky."

Here again, the agreement is more pronounced as we consider the \u03b8op within two standard deviation about the mean as shown by the vectors drawn in cyan in Fig. 4 (top right). Both BR and BPlk show highly ordered distribution. The magnetic field orientation between the region to the south-eastern and the north-western parts of the cloud shows a small variation. It is at the position of the cloud where the change may be occurring. However, more data towards the northeastern parts of the cloud is required to make a definitive statement. Whether the change in the field orientation is caused because of the formation of the cloud or the formation of the cloud occurred because of the bend in the field created by the two components of the magnetic field is unclear. In the case of a weaker magnetic field, gas dynamics is not controlled by the field and hence forced to follow the motion of the gas. However, as the field strength increases, the field lines dominate the gas dynamics helping the clouds to remain coherent (K\u00f6rtgen & Banerjee 2015)."

The field lines from BPlk (135 \u25e6) are well correlated with the BR (119 \u25e6) although there is more variation present in BR towards the south-west side accounting for higher dispersion in the polarization angles.

Fig. 4 shows that there is an excellent agreement between the field lines in the inner parts of the clouds (93\u25e6) to the field lines in the outer envelope (83\u25e6) of the cloud. Kirk et al.

It is evident from the Fig. 4, that there are changes in the large-scale magnetic field orientation around the cloud as found towards the north-east and south-west corners of the figure where field rotations are most likely causing a reduction in the degree of polarization possibly due to depolarization. Hacar & Tafalla (2011) have made a detailed study of L1517 in molecular lines and 1.2 mm dust continuum emission. They identified four filaments and five starless cores embedded in these filaments that are at different evolutionary stages. These filamentary structures stretch parallel to the direction of the extended emission and also to the direction of the magnetic fields. The magnetic fields towards the south of the cloud near AB Aur shown by blue star in Fig. 4) show more dis-oriented vectors with relatively large dispersion which could be because of the effects from this Herbig Ae star.

The field orientations follow the extended cloud structure of the cloud. The H2 density at the peak position of the core is estimated to be 1.3-5.6\u00d7105 cm\u22123. However, although the H2 density is such high enough to excite the inversion transitions of NH3, these lines are found to be very faint in L1521E (Hirota et al. 2002). Tafalla & Santiago (2004) compared the emission of two molecules, C18O and N2H+ which are known to have different depletion behaviours. While C18O gets heavily depleted at densities of a few 104 cm\u22123, N2H+ remains at gas phase up to densities of \u223c106 cm\u22123. Thus, the ratio between the integrated intensities of C18O and N2H+ is a good indicator of depletion which is found to be 3.4 in L1521E implying that this core is chemically less processed and therefore youngest core known with a contraction age of . 1.5 \u00d7 105 yr (Tafalla & Santiago 2004). However, this age is not compatible with the models of core formation via ambipolar diffusion, as they require evolutionary times of the order of 1 Myr. In that case, a more dynamical core formation scenario is required to create such a highly contracted core on a short time scale as estimated by using chemical models (Tafalla & Santiago 2004). The sharp edges to the southern side and a more extended distribution of material to the opposite direction could be a result of some external compression acted from the southern direction along the field lines that might have created the cloud."

The magnetic fields inferred from the H-band polarization measurements made by Clemens (2012) are shown using the vectors drawn in white. Though the field orientations inferred from both R-band and H-band are in good agreement with the Planck polarization measurements, there are differences seen between the H-band and the Planck magnetic field orientations towards the western parts of the cloud where a reduction in the degree of polarization is seen. There could be two components of magnetic field orientation in this case which might be causing a depolarization resulting in the reduction of polarization. The maps generated using the R-, H- and Planck present a smooth and ordered field geometry over the entire field containing the cloud. The magnetic field is predominantly perpendicular to the north-south elongation of the cloud. The weighted mean position angle of the magnetic field, averaged over the 16 positions observed by Ward-Thompson et al. (2000) in 850 \u00b5m is 46\u25e6. This represents the magnetic field geometry of the high density inner regions of the cloud which is at an offset of 74\u25e6, 57\u25e6and 48\u25e6 with respect to the magnetic fields inferred by the Planck, H-band and R-band polarization measurements.

The cloud magnetic fields are found to be parallel to inter-cloud magnetic fields in all the clouds. One common factor in all these selected clouds is their observed morphology. All the clouds show relatively bright rim on one side and the extended diffuse structure on the other side which can be noticed by the change in intensity along the elongation. We are interested in the direction of small intensity gradient in the cloud\u2019s\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201319 (2015)\nextended structure which is defined by \u03b8env. We visually selected directions from the brightest core in the map till the outer isocontours and calculated the gradient within the outer intensity isocontours. Hence, \u03b8env was extracted by taking the slowest change of intensity out of many selected directions. Table 3 shows the comparison between the magnetic field orientation (optical and Planck) with the structure of the cloud (\u03b8env). Our results suggest that the magnetic field lines in six clouds are almost oriented along the diffuse extended emission which is opposite the sharp edge of the cloud. One of the clouds, L183 which do not shows parallel orientation, showed almost same value of gradient in all the directions but different orientations. Kim et al. (2016) investigated a sample of starless cores using Akari emission maps and molecular line observations to conclude that the external feedback from the stars or the isotropic interstellar radiation field might play a crucial role in the evolution of the cores. In that study, L1512 and L1517B have been studied in detail using 3-160 \u00b5m emission and they are found to be affected by the presence of star in their vicinity. This could be responsible for the asymmetric shape of the far-infrared emission in L1512 and L1517. The fact that the magnetic fields in this study are along the elongation of cloud structure in majority of the clouds may suggest a link to the feedback or effect from the ISRF. V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. (2011) has suggested that the scenario of cloud formation is driven by colliding flows which can be guided by magnetic field and thereby facilitate the formation of filaments and fragmentation to the clumps/cores. The origin of these flows is still unknown. One possible explanation for the B-field aligned along the extended emission of the clouds is that the feedback from the stars nearby to the clouds might have stripped the clouds shown here."

(2004). Using 2\u00d7103 cm\u22123 as the average number density for all the clouds and the dispersion in polarization angle from table 2, the strength has been calculated as \u223c 27 \u00b5G, \u223c 18 \u00b5G, \u223c 21 \u00b5G, \u223c 26 \u00b5G,\u223c 23 \u00b5G and \u223c 78 \u00b5G for L1333, L1512, L1523, L1544, L1517 and L1521E, respectively. The magnetic field strength for high-latitude clouds, L1780 and L183 were estimated as 11 \u00b5G and 42 \u00b5G by Neha et al. (2016). Assuming typical uncertainty in the velocity dispersion and the polarization angles, the uncertainty in the magnetic field strength is estimated to be \u223c 0.5 Bpos.\nThe relative importance of the magnetic fields with respect to the self-gravity can be understood by calculating the mass-to-flux ratio which can tell whether or not magnetic fields are strong enough to support a molecular cloud against gravitational collapse (Mouschovias & Spitzer 1976). This can be quantified by a parameter (Crutcher 2004; Nakano & Nakamura 1978), \u03bb = 7.6\u00d7 10\u221221 NH2 /Bpos where NH2 is the column density in units of cm\n\u22122 and Bpos is the magnetic field strength in \u00b5G. The mass-to-flux ratio has been calculated for all the sources to discuss the magnetic criticality/stability. If \u03bb > 1, the cloud envelope is magnetically supercritical implying that the magnetic fields cannot support enough the cloud against gravitational collapse. Whereas if \u03bb < 1, it is magnetically sub-critical implying the magnetic fields can prevent the gravitational collapse of the cloud. We took the extinction values from GAIA DR3 measurements for the stars observed in optical polarization observations. Using an average value of extinction for each cloud, we estimated the column density for all the clouds as 1.95, 1.96, 1.95, 2.56, 2.22, 1.69 (\u00d7 1021) cm\u22122 using the relation as NH2 (cm\u22122) = 0.93\u00d7 1021 Av (mag) (Bohlin et al. 1978). We estimated the values of mass-to-flux ratio as 0.55, 0.83, 0.71, 0.75, 0.73, 0.16 for the clouds L1333, L1512, L1523, L1544, L1517 and L1521E, respectively. By adopting the column density as 1\u00d7 1021 (Montillaud et al. 2015), we estimated \u03bb to be 0.7 and 0.18 for L1780 and L183, respectively. Since both L1780 and L183 are high latitude clouds and are at similar galactic latitude, we used the same column density for L183 also. Considering the uncertainty in the values of magnetic field strength, all the clouds are approaching the critical value except L1333, L1521E and L183. This implies that the magnetic fields are marginally supporting the cloud envelope against the self-gravity and are likely to play a significant role in governing the cloud dynamics. The very low values of L1333, L1521E and L183 indicate that the magnetic fields are strong enough to dominate the gas dynamics in the cloud envelope and can delay the gravitational collapse."

Magneto-hydrodynamic simulations carried out by various authors Seifried et al. (2020); Heitsch et al. (2009) showed that the there is a significant change of magnetic field orientation (from low to high field strengths) in the formation of clouds. As the relative orientation of filaments and Bfield are correlated in nearby cloud complexes (Soler & Hennebelle 2017), the cores, being the nested structures, will have effect from the magnetization of the cloud. In this regard, the clump shapes and the orientations are important indicators of clump dynamics and fate of star formation. The core-background magnetic field can provide important clues about the dynamical importance of magnetic field at the cloud scale in comparison to stellar feedback or turbulent\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201319 (2015)\nmotions. In the previous section, we discussed the magnetic field orientation with respect to the distribution of the material around the clouds. In this section, we investigate the relative orientation between the core major axis and the ambient and the core-scale magnetic fields. Since the R-band polarization measurements trace the envelope magnetic fields or the fields at the periphery of the clouds, we define this as the ambient (\u03b8op) magnetic fields. The core-scale magnetic field defined by \u03b8plk is calculated by taking an average of the nearest three Planck polarization vectors around the inner regions of the cloud. The \u03b8plk thus obtained are listed in the column 6 of Table 4. The positions of the cores associated with the selected clouds and their properties are obtained using the python package Astrodendro algorithm (Rosolowsky et al. 2008) on Herschel 250 \u00b5m emission maps. The dendrogram method identifies emission features at successive isocontours in emission maps which are called \"leaves\" and then find the intensity values at which they merge with the neighbouring structures (branches and trunks). We supplied an emission threshold above which all the structures are identified and contour intervals which decides the boundary between the distinct structures. The initial threshold and the contour step size were selected as a multiple of the \u03c3, the rms of the intensity map. In our analysis, we are interested in the dense cores which are identified as leaves.\nFor each core, the dendrogram method estimated the core positions, the major and the minor axes, the effective radius of the core, and the position angle in degrees which is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. The core major and minor axes are calculated from the intensity-weighted second moment in the direction of the major axis or perpendicular to the major axis. The derived properties of the cores are presented in Table 4. A total of 19 cores were identified in six clouds studied here. The right ascension and the declination of the extracted cores are given in the columns 2 and 3. The column 4 gives the aspect ratios of the cores. The orientation of the major axis measured from the north increasing to the east is given in column 5. The sources having aspect ratio higher than 0.8 were removed from the analysis to consider only elongated cores (Chen et al. 2020). The smallest structure that can be considered as real is of size \u223c 0.75 FWHM (Miville-Desch\u00eanes et al. 2017). We selected only those sources where the derived radius is larger than 2-3 pixels with the beam size of 250 \u00b5m intensity map. In addition to these, we considered only those sources lying within the asymmetric structure of the cloud (shown by white contours in fig. 4 (right panel)). A total of 19 cores are identified in six clouds studied here, five cores in L1517, four in L183, three each in L1512 and L1544, two each in L1521E and L1780. We adopted the positions and major axis orientation of the cores in L1523 and L1333 from Lee & Myers (1999) as there are no Herschel maps available. The extracted cores in each cloud are shown in the panels of Fig. 4. In L1512, the major axis of the three extracted cores are almost parallel to each other and parallel to the ambient magnetic field. Interestingly, the core major axis orientation is along the elongated morphology of the cloud. In contrast, in L183, the major axes of three of the four cores are oriented parallel to each other, but perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field.\nIn Fig. 5, we show the distribution of the angle offset between the direction of core major axes with respect to the magnetic field from Planck, |\u03b8plk \u2212 \u03b8ma j| in left panel and the magnetic field from R-band polarization, |\u03b8op \u2212 \u03b8ma j| in right panel. If the core orientation has a significant effect due to the large-scale magnetic field, we expect the core major axis to be perpendicular to the magnetic field lines with a significant effect on the gas motions. Contrary to this, in the Fig. 5, we find that all the cores extracted show a random orientation\nwith respect to the outer (R-band) as well inner (Planck) magnetic field. We quantified our inference using a statistical technique, the Rayleigh circular statistic which gives a measure of relative alignment of structures with respect to the magnetic field and to obtain a statistical strength of that alignment (Jow et al. 2018). We define projected Rayleigh statistic (PRS) as Z = n\u2211\ni=1\ncos\u03c6i/ \u221a n/2, (5)\nwhere \u03c6i=2\u03b8i and \u03b8i is the offset between the magnetic field and core major axes. If Z \u00ab 0, it is considered to be parallel alignment and if Z \u00bb 0, it is considered to be a perpendicular alignment. If Z\u2248 0, the distribution is either random or preferentially lies around 45\u25e6. We have estimated Z to be 0.05 and -0.15 for Planck and R-band data, respectively. The offsets in both the cases are neither parallel nor perpendicular owing to the values close to zero and hence, follow random distribution. The same analysis was done by Jow et al. (2018) on the nearby Gould belt regions and Vela cloud to test the preferential alignment of column density structures with magnetic field and the values vary approximately from -5 to 5 to show transition from parallel to perpendicular alignment.\nThis result implies that the core orientation might not have a significant effect from the large-scale magnetic field as per the scenario of magnetic field dominated low mass star formation (Shu et al. 1987; Mouschovias & Ciolek 1999). There might be other factors that can contribute to shaping the core morphology such as feedback effects or the ram pressure as suggested by Chen & Ostriker (2018). Although we expect that the cores tend to align their major axis perpendicular to the local magnetic field where the flow of material will be preferential to favour the collapse mechanism, the environment can be a crucial effect towards the morphology of the cores. Chen & Ostriker (2018) showed that the environment also plays an important role in shaping the prestellar cores through ram pressure and magnetic pressure. The turbulence created by stellar feedback may affect the orientation of the cores\u2019 minor axis (Kim et al. 2016) or the local magnetization within the cloud (Chen et al. 2020).\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201319 (2015)"

Of these, we took observations for six of these clouds, namely, L1512, L1523, L1333, L1521E, L1517 and L1544. These sources were chosen on the basis of their cloud morphology from Herschel 250 \u00b5m emission or Dobashi extinction map having sharp edges on one side and an extended emission on the opposite direction to trace the plane-ofthe-sky magnetic field geometry of these clouds. Two more clouds, L1780 and L183, showing this emission were added to the sample from the literature. The main goals of the study are (a) to investigate the relationship between the observed magnetic field orientation with respect to the elongated morphology seen in the clouds; (b) to investigate the relationship between the magnetic field orientations inside the clouds inferred from the Planck polarization and the envelope-scale field inferred from the optical polarization mea-\nsurements of background starlight; (c) to examine the relative offsets between the core major axes orientation with respect to both inner and outer magnetic field directions. The results obtained from this study are given below:\n(i) Based on the distribution of the degree of polarization and the position angles of the stars projected on all the eight clouds (measured by us in R-band and taken from archival data) with respect to the distances of the stars obtained from the Gaia EDR3, we show evidence that all the stars are found to be located at distance farther than \u223c200 pc.\n(ii) In all the eight clouds studied here, the magnetic fields inferred from the R-band polarization and the Planck polarization measurements are in excellent agreement, suggesting that it is the same dust population which is possibly responsible for the production of polarization that is detected in the two techniques.\n(iii) In seven out of eight clouds studied, the projected magnetic\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201319 (2015)\nfield is aligned with the direction of diffuse emission of cloud. The one cloud, L183, has its diffuse emission oriented perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field.\n(iv) The magnetic field strength estimated with DCF method in all the clouds ranges from 11-78 \u00b5G. With the column density and the derived field strength, we calculated the mass-to-flux ratio, \u03bb with the values ranging from 0.16-0.83. Except L1333, L1521E, and L183 all the clouds show magnetically critical state suggesting that the magnetic pressure are almost supporting the gravity in the cloud envelope.\n(v) A total of 19 cores are extracted from the six clouds. The major axes of the three cores found in L1512 from Herschel 250 \u00b5m emission are not only found to be parallel to each other but also to both the projected magnetic fields and the direction of diffuse emission of the cloud. In contrast, for three out of four cores in L183, their major axes are found to be parallel to each other and also to the cloud elongation, but almost perpendicular to the orientation of the ambient magnetic field.\n(vi) The orientation of the core major axis with respect to the (projected) ambient and the inner magnetic fields is randomly distributed."
