    "abstractText": "We prepared a rhodamine-TEMPO chromophore-radical dyad (RB-TEMPO) to study the radical enhanced intersystem crossing (REISC). The visible light-harvesting chromophore rhodamine is connected with the TEMPO (a nitroxide radical) via a C\u2013N bond. The UV-vis absorption spectrum indicates negligible electron interaction between the two units at the ground state. Interestingly, the fluorescence of the rhodamine moiety is strongly quenched in RB-TEMPO, and the fluorescence lifetime of the rhodamine moiety is shortened to 0.29 ns, from the lifetime of 3.17 ns. We attribute this quenching effect to the intramolecular electron spin\u2013spin interaction between the nitroxide radical and the photoexcited rhodamine chromophore. Nanosecond transient absorption spectra confirm the REISC in RB-TEMPO, indicated by the detection of the rhodamine chromophore triplet excited state; the lifetime was determined as 128 ns, which is shorter than the native rhodamine triplet state lifetime (0.58 \u03bcs). The zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters of the triplet state of the chromophore were determined with the pulsed laser excited time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra. RB-TEMPO was used as a photoinitiator for the photopolymerization of pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA). These studies are useful for the design of heavy atom-free triplet photosensitizers, the study of the ISC, and the electron spin dynamics of the radical-chromophore systems upon photoexcitation.",

            "text": "Triplet photosensitizers (PSs) have attracted much attention in recent years [1\u20134], because these compounds are significant in fundamental photochemistry studies [2,5,6], as well as in applications such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) [7,8], photocatalysis [9\u201311], photovoltaics [12], photopolymerizations [13] and triplet-triplet annihilation-based upconversion, etc. [14\u201319]. Triplet PSs usually show strong absorption of light, efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), appropriate excited state energy and redox potentials [2]. ISC efficiency is one of the critical factors concerning the application of the triplet PSs. ISC in organic molecules is usually enhanced by the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effect. For instance, the heavy atom attached to a chromophore may enhance the ISC, via the so-called heavy atom effect [20], the representative compounds based on this approach are the precious metal phosphorescent complexes, such as the polyimine Ir(III), Pt(II), Ru(II), and Os(II) complexes [21\u201325], and the organic compounds containing bromine or iodine atoms in the molecular structures [2]. Organic molecules with an electronic excited state having the\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11220. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241311220 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11220 2 of 16\nn\u2212\u03c0* transition usually show efficient ISC, and the corresponding ISC complies with EI Sayed\u2019s rule [26,27]. Recently, we and others showed that energy level matching of the S1 and Tn states (n > 1) may result in efficient ISC [28,29]. Although this mechanism may manifest in a twisted molecular structure, the recent evidence shows this may be just a coincidence [30,31]. Charge recombination-induced ISC is also known for organic compounds, including the radical pair ISC (RP ISC) in electron donor\u2013acceptor dyads containing long linkers, and the recently developed spin\u2013orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT-ISC) in compact, orthogonal electron donor\u2013acceptor dyads [4,32\u201334]. Fullerene, such as C60, has been used as an electron spin converter connected with a visible light-harvesting antenna to construct heavy atom-free triplet PSs [35\u201338]. Radical enhanced ISC (REISC) has also been proposed [39,40]. In this approach, a stable radical, such as the nitroxide radical (TEMPO, etc.) is covalently attached to a visible light-harvesting chromophore, and the electron spin\u2013spin interaction between the nitroxide radical and the photoexcited chromophore will make the otherwise electron spin forbidden ISC of the light-harvesting chromophore possible [41,42]. The mechanism is that for this three-electron system, doublet (D) and quartet states (Q) are resulted due to the electron spin\u2013spin interaction between the radical and the electronically excited chromophore. For the Dn state (n\u2264 2, etc.), populated directly upon photoexcitation into the visible light-harvesting chromophore, the chromophore is in a closed-shell electronic configuration. For the D1 state, however, the chromophore could be in an open-shell electronic configuration (i.e., the chromophore has a total spin angular momentum of S2 = 2). Dn \u2192 D1 transition is overall electron spin allowed; thus, the ISC of the chromophore becomes spin allowed. As a result, attachment of a stable radical to a chromophore usually results in the ISC of the light-harvesting chromophore [39,40,43]. Some molecular systems based on this approach have been reported, such as those based on chromophores of Bodipy [39,44], perylenebisimide (PBI) [42,45], naphthalenediimide (NDI) [40], and cyanine dyes [43], etc. However, it is clear that much room is left for using this molecular structure protocol to design new heavy atom-free triplet PSs. For instance, the selection of a proper chromophore and the linker between the radical and the chromophore is critical to optimize the photophysical property of the resulted dyad for the purpose of designing an ideal triplet PSs [39]. Moreover, the triplet state lifetimes are strongly dependent on the structure of the chromophore and the linker (length, \u03c0-conjugation, or saturated structure, etc.) [39,46]. More chromophores are needed to elucidate the relation between the molecular structure and the triplet state property. We have noticed that the triplet state lifetime of a specific chromophore is dependent on the ISC mechanism. Rhodamine is a popular chromophore showing strong absorption of visible light, and has been widely used in the study of fluorescence, molecular probes, and luminescence bioimaging. However, to our surprise, this chromophore has not been used for REISC. In order to address the above challenges, herein we prepared a rhodamine-TEMPO (RB-TEMPO, Scheme 1); the photophysical property, especially the ISC and the triplet state property, was studied by using steady state UV-vis absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, and nanosecond transient absorption spectra. A preliminary study on the photopolymerization with RB-TEMPO as a photoinitiator is also presented.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11220 3 of 16Int. J. Mol.

Molecular Structure Design Rationales\nWe prepared RB-TEMPO (Scheme 1), which is feasibly synthesized with the commercially available rhodamine and the 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) [47,48]. This compound was reported previously [49,50], However, it was used as fluorescent molecular robes, the photophysical property was not studied in detail. For the selective detection of biologically related radicals, the ISC and the triplet excited state were not studied. The yield is satisfactory; the molecular structure is verified by 1H NMR and HRMS (see Figures S1 and S2). Compounds used as reference compounds in the studies are also presented in Scheme 1.\n2.2. UV-Vis Absorption and Fluorescence Spectra The UV-vis absorption spectra of the compounds were studied (Figures 1 and S3\u2013S5). RB shows the characteristic strong absorption band at 554 nm (\u03b5 = 1.16 \u00d7 105 M\u22121 cm\u22121). For RB-TEMPO, however, no such absorption band was observed, indicating that the RBTEMPO molecules adopt a closed ring, lactam structure. TEMPO does not show any strong absorption in the visible spectral range. In order to confirm that RB-TEMPO has a lactam structure, we studied the evolution of the UV-vis absorption spectra of RB-TEMPO in the presence of acid in a protic solvent (EtOH. Figure 1b). With strong acid, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), added, a strong absorption band at 555 nm developed (Figure 1b); and changes in absorbance over time are also studied (Figure S8); this absorption band is virtually the same as that of the native rhodamine (Figure 1a) and this process is reversible. This phenomenon was also observed in dichloromethane (DCM. Figure S7) and acetonitrile (ACN. Figure S11). With a base added, the molecular structure changes to the closed form (Figure S9). We also tested the UV\u2013vis absorption spectrum of RB-TEMPO with the addition of trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane, acetonitrile, and methanol; similar results were observed (Figures S6, S10 and S12).\nScheme 1.

The fluorescence property of the compounds was studied (Figure 2). In Figure 1a, we can observe that RB and RB-TEMPO indicate absorption at 300 nm, so we excited these two compounds at 300 nm. RB gives a strong fluorescence band centered at 570 nm, under an acid condition in a polar solvent. In contrast, RB-TEMPO gives much weaker fluorescence, at the similar wavelength (Figure 2a). The quenching of the fluorescence of RB is attributed to the electron spin\u2013spin interaction of the radical with the photoexcited RB chromophore; it is unlikely due to the photo-induced electron transfer or F\u00f6rster singlet energy transfer [52]. Although the quenching of fluorescence of RB by attaching TEMPO was reported previously, and used as a fluorescence switch-on molecular probe for the detection of reactive radicals such as CH3\u2022, the quenching mechanism was not studied in detail [49,50]. The fluorescence spectra of EY and RBC are given in supplementary information (Figures S14 and S15).\nFigure 1.

Although the quen hing of fluorescence of RB by attach ng TEMPO was reported previously, a d sed as a fl or scence switch-on mol cula probe for the detection of reactive radicals such as CH3\u2022, the quenching mechanism was not studied in detail [49,50]. The fluorescence spectra of EY and RBC are given in supple ntary informati (Figures S14 and S15). The fluorescence lifetimes of the compounds were studied (Figure 2b). For the reference compound B, the fluorescence lifetime was determined as 3.17 ns (monoexponential decay). For RB-TEMPO, however, a much shorter fluorescence lifetime was observed as 0.29 ns (95.9%)/2.37 ns (4.1%). The faster relaxation of the emissive S1 state of the rhodamine moiety in RB-TEMPO is attributed to the REISC effect (see later section). In order to rule out the possibility that the fluorescence quenching in RB-TEMPO is caused by any intermolecular interaction, we also studied the fluorescence of compound RB in the presence of TEMPO (Figure 3). The results show that the fluorescence of RB was quenched to a minor extent, even in the presence of a large excess of TEMPO (100 equiv. Figure 3a). The fluorescence lifetime study shows that the fluorescence lifetime is 2.92 ns for the mixture of RB and TEMPO (50 equiv.). These results show that the quenching of the fluorescence of RB by intermolecular interaction is much weaker than the intramolecular quenching effect in RB-TEMPO. This is reasonable because the fluorescence lifetime of the rhodamine is short (a few ns); in comparison, the molecular diffusion is a much slower process, and the majority of molecules at the S1 state emit fluorescence before encountering with the TEMPO radical via diffusion in the fluid solution. We also measure the fluorescence lifetime of EY (Figure S16).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11220 5 of 16 Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 16\nFigure 2.

For the reference compound RB, the fluorescence lifetime was determined as 3.17 ns (monoexponential decay). For RB-TEMPO, however, a much shorter fluorescence lifetime was observed as 0.29 ns (95.9%)/2.37 ns (4.1%). The faster relaxation of the emissive S1 state of the rhodamine moiety in RB-TEMPO is attributed to the REISC effect (see later section).\nIn order to rule out the possibility that the fluorescence quenching in RB-TEMPO is caused by any intermolecular interaction, we also studied the fluorescence of compound RB in the presence of TEMPO (Figure 3). The results show that the fluorescence of RB was quenched to a minor extent, even in the presence of a large excess of TEMPO (100 equiv. Figure 3a). The fluorescence lifetime study shows that the fluorescence lifetime is 2.92 ns for the mixture of RB and TEMPO (50 equiv.). These results show that the quenching of the fluorescence of RB by intermolecular interaction is much weaker than the intramolecular quenching effect in RB-TEMPO. This is reasonable because the fluorescence lifetime of the rhodamine is short (a few ns); in comparison, the molecular diffusion is a much slower process, and the majority of molecules at the S1 state emit fluorescence before encountering with the TEMPO radical via diffusion in the fluid solution. We also measure the fluorescence lifetime of EY (Figure S16).\nFigure 3. (a) Fluorescence emission spectra change with incremental amount of TEMPO added to RB\nsolution in EtOH.

This short lifetime is reasonable, because the nitroxide radical center is close to the RB chromophore; this character may lead to strong electron spin\u2013spin interaction between the radical and the photoexcited chromophore. Consequently, it may shorten the triplet state lifetime [39]. Previously, the triplet state lifetime of the native rhodamine B was determined as 0.58 \u00b5s (in methanol) [55]. It is reported that the acridine triplet state can be used to sensitize the formation of rhodamine triplet states. It is unlikely that the direct excitation of rhodamine would lead to observable transient excited states on the microsecond timescales, since the quantum yield for an intersystem crossing is too low. The triplet state lifetime of RB was also measured by direct excitation, as 94 ns (Figure S17). This result shows that the linker length (and also the electronic feature) should be optimized for designing a heavy atom-free triplet PSs based on the REISC mechanism. Previously, a short triplet state lifetime of perylene was determined as 100 ns in a perylene\u2013 nitroxide dyad, which is attributed to the short distance between the nitroxide spin carrier and the perylene chromophore. We show that in Bodipy\u2013TEMPO dyads, the longer the\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 11220 7 of 16\nlinker is, the longer the triplet state lifetime of the Bodipy moiety may have. However, the ISC quantum yield may be low for dyads containing a long linker [39]. It should be pointed out that here the \u2018triplet\u2019 state refers to the RB chromophore\u2019s electronic configuration. Overall, the photoexcited state of RB-TEMPO is a three-electron spin system; only the doublet (square of spin angular momentum S2 = 3/4) and quartet state (square of angular momentum S2 = 15/4) exist. However, the optical spectroscopy, such as the ns-TA spectroscopy, is unable to discriminate the doublet state and the quarter state, because these states share similar energy, and the difference is the electron spin\u2013spin interaction. Moreover, the absorption of the D1 and Q1 state are virtually the same, i.e., the electronic transition to higher states of the chromophore or the TEMPO radical. This scenario is different from the S1 state and T1 state of the same chromophore. In a twoelectron spin system, in this case, drastically different excited state absorption spectra can be found for the S1 and T1 states. As a control experiment, we measured the ns-TA spectra of Eosin Y (Figure 5). Due to the presence of four bromine atoms attached to the chromophore, the ISC should be enhanced by the heavy atom effect.

Note for RB-TEMPO, the ion exchange reaction may exist as well; therefore intramolecular electron transfer may occur, which leads to the generation of the hexyl radical and photopolymerization results as well. (\u201c*\u201d represents the excited state of the photosensitizer, \u201c1\u201d represents the singlet state, \u201c3\u201d represents the triplet state.)\nInterestingly, we found that the reference compound RB is also active to initiate the photopolymerization of PETA (Figure 7p). Note the fluorescence lifetime of RB is short (3.17 ns), considering the ionic character of both RB and NB. We proposed there exists an ion exchange reaction between RB and NB. The boronate anion may become the counter anion of the RB molecules; as a result, intramolecular electron transfer between the boronate anion and the xanthene cation of RB is possible, which produces the hexyl radical and subsequently it initiates the polymerization of PETA. This is supported by the change of the UV-Vis absorption spectra of RB after mixing with NB (Figure S21 in the Supplementary Information) [68].\nIn order to study the intermolecular electron transfer or intramolecular electron transfer, after the ion exchange upon mixing of RB/RB-TEMPO (with NB), the UV-vis absorption spectra of RB and RB-TEMPO in the presence of NB upon photoirradiation were recorded (Figure S21 in the Supplementary Information). Upon photoirradiation of the mixture, the absorption of the RB chromophore centered at 555 nm is diminished, indicating the photobleaching of the rhodamine chromophore, as a result of inter/intramolecular electron transfer (Figure S21 in the Supplementary Information). And the fluorescence lifetime of RB in the presence of NB was also measured (Figure S24). As a comparative experiment, we also detect the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of RB only and find no significant changes in absorbance (Figure S22) which proves the light stability of RB. Under the dark condition, the absorbance change after adding NB to RB is not obvious, indicating that the electron transfer process can only occur after RB is excited by light (Figure S23). Interestingly, we found the photobleaching is more significant for RB, than RB-TEMPO (Figure S20 in the Supplementary Information). Considering that the ion exchange reaction may occur, intramolecular electron transfer is possible. Note the singlet state lifetime of RB (3.17 ns) is longer than RB-TEMPO (0.29 ns); thus, the more significant photobleaching for RB/NB is reasonable. It should be pointed out that the triplet excited state of the rhodamine moiety is unable to drive an electron transfer with NB as the electron donor.\nScheme 2. Photochemical mechanisms of a generation of radicals for the RB/NB system. Note for RB-TEMPO, the ion exchange reaction may exist as well; therefore intramolecular electron transfer may occur, which leads to the generation of the hexyl radical and photopolymerization results as well. (\u201c*\u201d represents the excited state of the photosensitizer, \u201c1\u201d represents the singlet state, \u201c3\u201d represents the triplet state.)\nInterestingly, we found that the reference compound RB is also active to initiate the photopolymerization of PETA (Figure 7p). Note the fluorescence lifetime of RB is short (3.17 ns), considering the ionic character of both RB and NB. We proposed there exists an ion exchange reaction between RB and NB. The boronate anion may become the counter anion of the RB molecules; as a result, intramolecular electron transfer between the boronate anion and the xanthene cation of RB is possible, which produces the hexyl radical and subsequent y i initiates the polymerization of PETA. This is supported by the change of the UV-Vis absorption spectra of RB after mixing with NB (Figure S21 in the Supplementary Information) [68].

            "text": "In summary, in order to study the radical enhanced intersystem crossing (REISC), we prepared a rhodamine-TEMPO chromophore\u2013radical dyad (RB-TEMPO). The visible lightharvesting chromophore rhodamine is connected with the TEMPO (nitroxide radical) via the C\u2013N bond. The UV-vis absorption spectrum indicates a negligible electron interaction between the two units at the ground state. Interestingly, fluorescence of the rhodamine moiety is strongly quenched in RB-TEMPO, and the fluorescence lifetime of the rhodamine moiety is shortened to 0.29 ns, from that of 3.17 ns of the native rhodamine chromophore. We attribute this quenching effect to the intramolecular electron spin\u2013spin interaction between the nitroxide radical and the photoexcited rhodamine chromophore. This conclusion is supported by the control experiment which shows the intermolecular interaction of the rhodamine and TEMPO leads to a much weaker quenching effect. Nanosecond transient absorption spectra confirm the REISC effect in RB-TEMPO, indicated by the detection of the rhodamine chromophore triplet excited state; the triplet state lifetime was determined as 0.128 ns, which is shorter than the rhodamine triplet state lifetime (0.58 \u00b5s). The zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters of the triplet state of the chromophore were determined with the pulsed laser excited time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra as D = \u22121600 MHz and E = 530 MHz. RB-TEMPO was used as a photoinitiator for the photopolymerization of pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA), in the presence of a co-initiator (also acts as an electron donor) tetrabutylammonium tris(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)hexylborate. Intermolecular and intramolecular (ion exchange reaction exist) electron transfer between the rhodamine chromophore and the co-initiator exist, leading to the production of the alkyl radical, which initiates the radical polymerization of the monomers. These studies are useful for the design of heavy atom-free triplet photosensitizers and study of the ISC and electron spin dynamics of these versatile organic molecules.\nInt. J. Mol.
