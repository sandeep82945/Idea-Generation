Development of Stimuli-Responsive PEO-PCL Nanocarriers: Investigating the design of PEO-PCL based nanocarriers that are responsive to specific stimuli (pH, temperature, enzymes) present in the disease microenvironment. This can lead to the creation of more targeted and efficient drug release mechanisms that minimize side effects and improve therapeutic outcomes.

Enhancing the Targeting Capability of PEO-PCL Nanocarriers: Exploring the conjugation of targeting ligands or antibodies to the surface of PEO-PCL nanocarriers to improve their ability to specifically recognize and bind to diseased cells or tissues. This approach could enhance the efficacy of drug delivery systems for cancer therapy and other diseases where targeted action is crucial.

Investigating Biodegradation Mechanisms and Kinetics: Conducting in-depth studies on the biodegradation mechanisms and kinetics of PEO-PCL based nanocarriers in various physiological conditions. Understanding how these nanocarriers degrade over time in the body can inform the design of safer and more effective drug delivery systems.

Application of PEO-PCL Nanocarriers in Gene Therapy: Expanding the application of PEO-PCL based nanocarriers to deliver genetic material, such as DNA, RNA, or CRISPR-Cas9 components, for gene therapy. Research could focus on optimizing carrier design for efficient encapsulation, protection, and delivery of genetic material to target cells.

Exploring the Use of PEO-PCL Nanocarriers for Combination Therapy: Designing studies to evaluate the potential of PEO-PCL based nanocarriers for co-delivering multiple therapeutic agents (drugs, proteins, nucleic acids) for combination therapy. This could address the challenge of treating complex diseases, such as multidrug-resistant cancer, by delivering a synergistic combination of therapeutics within a single nanocarrier system.
