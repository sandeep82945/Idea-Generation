1. **Investigate the genetic basis of root system architecture (RSA) traits in peach rootstocks.** This could be done through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping or genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This information could be used to develop molecular markers for RSA traits, which could be used in breeding programs to select for rootstocks with desired RSA characteristics.


2. **Evaluate the relationship between RSA traits and drought tolerance in peach rootstocks.** This could be done by growing rootstocks with different RSA traits under drought stress conditions and measuring their survival, growth, and yield. This information could be used to identify RSA traits that are associated with drought tolerance, which could be used in breeding programs to select for rootstocks that are more tolerant to drought.


3. **Investigate the relationship between RSA traits and nutrient uptake efficiency in peach rootstocks.** This could be done by growing rootstocks with different RSA traits in soils with different nutrient levels and measuring their nutrient uptake efficiency. This information could be used to identify RSA traits that are associated with nutrient uptake efficiency, which could be used in breeding programs to select for rootstocks that are more efficient at taking up nutrients from the soil.


4. **Evaluate the relationship between RSA traits and soil health in peach orchards.** This could be done by measuring soil health indicators, such as soil organic matter content, microbial biomass, and nutrient cycling, in orchards planted with rootstocks with different RSA traits. This information could be used to identify RSA traits that are associated with improved soil health, which could be used in breeding programs to select for rootstocks that promote soil health.


5. **Develop new methods for studying RSA in peach rootstocks.** This could include the development of new imaging techniques, root sampling methods, or data analysis methods. These new methods could be used to study RSA in more detail and to gain a better understanding of the role that RSA plays in peach production.
