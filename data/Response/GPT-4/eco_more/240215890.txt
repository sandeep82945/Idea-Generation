Exploration of Non-Binary Outcomes: The paper focuses on tasks with binary outcomes (success or failure). Future research could explore contract design in environments with more nuanced or continuous outcomes. For instance, how might contracts be structured if the outcomes can vary in degree of success, such as different levels of sales achievement or project milestones with varying levels of completion and quality?

Dynamic Contracts and Learning: Investigate how contracts might evolve over time as the principal and agents learn more about each other's preferences, abilities, and the nature of tasks. This includes studying the impact of repeated interactions and historical performance data on the structure of optimal contracts. Additionally, how might contracts adjust in real-time based on interim outcomes or new information?

Diverse Agent Preferences and Risk Attitudes: The model assumes risk-neutral agents. Expanding this to incorporate varying risk preferences among agents and exploring how contracts can be optimally designed to cater to a more diverse set of agents' risk attitudes could provide more realistic insights. For example, how do contracts balance the trade-off between fixed salaries and performance-based incentives among risk-averse and risk-seeking agents?

Multi-Tasking and Task Interdependencies: Extend the model to consider agents working on multiple tasks simultaneously, where the tasks may have interdependencies or complementarities. Research could focus on how contracts can incentivize optimal effort allocation across tasks, especially when some tasks might have synergies or trade-offs with others.

Application to Real-World Scenarios and Comparative Analysis: Applying the model to specific industries or contexts, such as sales teams, R&D departments, or crowdsourced innovation challenges, to understand the practical implications of these contract designs. Comparative analysis across different sectors could reveal insights into how industry-specific factors influence the optimal contract structure. Additionally, empirical studies could validate theoretical predictions and offer feedback loops for refining the models.
