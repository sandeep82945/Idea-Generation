    "abstractText": "Mobile health applications, which employ wireless technology for healthcare, can aid behaviour change and subsequently improve health outcomes. Mobile health applications have been developed to increase physical activity, but are rarely grounded on behavioural theory and employ simple techniques for personalisation, which has been proven effective in promoting behaviour change. In this work, we propose a theoretically driven and personalised behavioural intervention delivered through an adaptive knowledge-based system. The behavioural system design is guided by the Behavioural Change Wheel and the CapabilityOpportunity-Motivation behavioural model. The system exploits the ever-increasing availability of health data from wearable devices, point-of-care tests and consumer genetic tests to issue highly personalised physical activity and sedentary behaviour recommendations. To provide the personalised recommendations, the system firstly classifies the user into one of four diabetes clusters based on their cardiometabolic profile. Secondly, it recommends activity levels based on their genotype and past activity history, and finally, it presents the user with their current risk of developing cardiovascular disease. In addition, leptin, a hormone involved in metabolism, is included as a feedback biosignal to personalise the recommendations further. As a case study, we designed and demonstrated the system on people with type 2 diabetes, since it is a chronic condition often managed through lifestyle changes, such as physical activity increase and sedentary behaviour reduction. We trained and simulated the system using data from diabetic participants of the UK Biobank, a large-scale clinical database, and demonstrate that the system could help increase activity over time. These results warrant a real-life implementation of the system, which we aim to evaluate through human intervention.",

Mobile health applications have\nbeen developed to increase physical activity, but are rarely grounded on behavioural theory\nand employ simple techniques for personalisation, which has been proven effective in pro-\nmoting behaviour change. In this work, we propose a theoretically driven and personalised\nbehavioural intervention delivered through an adaptive knowledge-based system. The\nbehavioural system design is guided by the Behavioural Change Wheel and the Capability-\nOpportunity-Motivation behavioural model. The system exploits the ever-increasing avail-\nability of health data from wearable devices, point-of-care tests and consumer genetic tests\nto issue highly personalised physical activity and sedentary behaviour recommendations.\nTo provide the personalised recommendations, the system firstly classifies the user into one\nof four diabetes clusters based on their cardiometabolic profile.

            "text": "mHealth (mobile health) technology is the use of wireless technology in medical care that can improve health outcomes due to its widespread appeal, accessibility and ability to reach large populations at a low-cost [1]. Many mHealth interventions have been developed to promote physical activity (PA), which mainly use wrist-worn or smartphone accelerometers and employ simple digital techniques. These mHealth interventions rarely utilise a holistic approach in attempting to positively alter one\u2019s behaviour, such as grounding the intervention on behavioural theory and personalisation, which has been positively correlated with successful behaviour changes [2]. A systematic review and meta-regression [3] found that personalisation is effective in changing lifestyle behaviours and that the source of data used in the personalisation greatly affects the effectiveness of the intervention. Therefore, one of the main research gaps in behaviour change interventions is the effective use of personalisation, which can increase engagement and effectiveness of the interventions by improving one\u2019s perceived skills and motivation [4]. According to the Self-Efficacy Theory [5], motivation is driven by self-efficacy, i.e. a person\u2019s belief in their ability to succeed, which is developed through repeated successes to challenges that become more difficult as the skills improve. Consequently, personalisation of the intervention is critical to ensure that the subject builds high self-efficacy to succeed in the behaviour change process.\nTo achieve personalisation, interventions using artificial intelligence, specifically recom-\nmender or expert systems, have been developed. For example, Ni et al. [6] used a long shortterm memory recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on user identity, sport type and historical workout sequences to recommend workout routes based on personal criteria (such as workout length and heart rate) and expectations. The model also predicts whether a user\u2019s heart rate will exceed a user-set threshold if they continue at the current pace and suggest ways to hit the user\u2019s target. Mahyari et al. [7] developed an intervention with RNN personalised such that the recommendations are highly likely to be performed based on past exercise history. Zhao et al. [8] developed and tested the efficacy of a tree-like personalised gamification intervention that recommends activity type, time and location based on the user\u2019s general information, personality, and daily activity data from smartphone or wearable tracker. However, these works make limited use of personalisation compared to the levels that could be achieved given the ever-increasing availability of personal data. In recent years, and more specifically with the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of point-of-care [9] and consumer genetic tests [10] offers the possibility of collecting even more health-related data to develop technology-driven interventions. For example, DnaNudge, a direct-to-consumer genetic service informed by behavioural science, developed an expert system that recommends food\nPLOS Digital Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333 August 30, 2023 2 / 22\nfollowing competing interests: CT is the co-founder of DnaNudge.\nproducts with a suitable nutritional value depending on one\u2019s genetic risk of developing metabolic conditions [11]. DnaNudge also encourages users to reduce sedentary time, with the penalty of having decreased food choices until a preset number of steps is achieved. However, while DnaNudge uses genetic information to recommend food choices, it does not use genotypes specific to physical activity, nor does it provide activity recommendations; rather, it lets the user set their preferred activity levels.\nThe knowledge-based system presented in the paper addresses the gaps in the current litera-\nture on recommender systems for PA. To demonstrate the concept, the system is developed and evaluated on a type 2 diabetes (T2D) population. T2D is a highly prevalent chronic condition linked to insulin resistance caused by obesity, a diet high in carbohydrates and inactivity, and is managed through lifestyle changes and drug therapy. Lifestyle management, including PA promotion, is the first-line therapy to improve glucose control in T2D [12]. In addition, with the recent understanding of the damages of sedentary behaviour (SB)\u2014i.e., waking activities that require lying or sitting\u2014people with T2D are now also recommended to reduce their sedentary time, as this is associated with increased glucose metabolism biomarkers [13]. To promote a healthier lifestyle effectively, behaviour-change strategies are recommended. In particular, technology-enabled interventions can be especially useful in increasing activity and reducing sedentary time, thus improving glucose control in T2D patients [14].\nHowever, T2D is a highly heterogeneous disease, and a one-size-fits-all approach may not be optimal. As such, the first aim of this work is to identify phenotypically distinct clusters of T2D which we then use to personalise the system. Specifically, we identify four clusters based on common biomarkers of T2D. Several studies have explored the clustering of diabetic patients [15\u201321], but all have analysed the clusters in terms of disease risk and progression and not in relation to lifestyle factors. The clusters were determined with various methods (Kmeans [16, 18], hierarchical clustering [17, 19, 20], TwoStep clustering [15, 21]) and using features including blood chemistry, anthropometric data and measures of glucose metabolism. However, none of the studies in the literature considered the associations between clusters and lifestyle risk factors. Determining such associations is essential to develop personalised behavioural therapies for T2D patients to lower the risk of comorbidities related to a poor lifestyle. Therefore, the first aim of this work is to replicate the clusters in a new sample, the UK Biobank, quantify the differences in PA and SB between clusters, and determine their effects on the risk of developing CVD\u2013a condition commonly associated with T2D.\nThe second aim of this work is to design and test a new knowledge-based system for per-\nsonalised lifestyle change. Despite the increasing complexity and number of mHealth interventions available, these technologies fail to induce long-term changes [1]. Reviews have highlighted the need to use behavioural theories to design interventions in order to achieve higher efficacy [2]. Therefore, we designed the high-level structure of the system following the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation Behavioural (COM-B) model and the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) [22]. The BCW provides a framework to develop complex interventions that is comprehensive, coherent and linked to a behavioural model, the COM-B model. This framework has been used to develop digital interventions that are both accepted by users and effective for a variety of behaviours, including improving diet [23\u201325], increasing physical activity [23, 26, 27] and reducing sedentary behaviour [28], management of hypertension [29] and diabetes [30, 31], smoking cessation [32, 33], alcohol reduction [34] and medication adherence [35, 36] or discontinuation [37].\nThe present system (high-level diagram shown in Fig 1) enables the behaviour change pro-\ncess by using several layers of personalisation: firstly by classifying the user into one of four diabetes clusters, secondly by recommending activity levels based on their genotype and past activity history, and finally by presenting the user with their risk of developing cardiovascular\nPLOS Digital Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333 August 30, 2023 3 / 22\ndisease (CVD) based on their current activity levels. Another layer of personalisation is achieved by including leptin as a feedback biosignal to inform on the efficacy of the intervention towards weight loss. In fact, leptin is a biomarker for obesity management therapies as leptin resistance is related to obesity and leptin levels vary with dieting regimens [38]. To our knowledge, no previous system or intervention has used blood chemistry as a feedback signal for behavioural change interventions. Biomarkers have previously been used to assess the efficacy of interventions, but never as an integral part of the recommendation systems. Additionally, the proposed system includes SB alongside PA, which works have overlooked, despite it being paramount to improving glucose control in T2D populations.\nFinally, we present the results of simulations of the proposed system on the data from the\nUK Biobank, a large-scale clinical database with biomedical data on more than 500,000 participants."

Clustering was done using the markers rescaled to the [0, 1] range. The dataset was split based on gender and analysed separately to avoid sex-dependent differences [15]. After removing participants with missing values for one or more biomarkers, 14,149 participants (9,054 males and 5,095 females) were included in the cluster analysis.\nFour clustering methods were tested with the scikit-learn [40] and scikit-learn-extra in Python: k-means, k-medoids, agglomerative hierarchical clustering and Gaussian mixture models (GMM). The hyperparameters were tuned based on the silhouette width [41] metric. Cluster stability was evaluated using the bootstrapped Jaccard coefficient in the R fpc package [42], which computes the similarity between clusters on the whole sample to clusters on the bootstrapped dataset (1000 resamples). A cluster with a Jaccard coefficient value\ufffd 0.75 is considered stable [42]. The clustering methods were evaluated based on the silhouette, CalisnkiHarabasz and Davies-Boulding scores. Differences in cardiometabolic biomarkers between clusters were assessed with one-way ANOVA (effect sizes reported as Cohen\u2019s d), and a Bonferroni correction was applied to the p-value to account for multiple tests.\nRegression analysis. To assess inter-cluster differences in associations between PA (or\nSB) and CVD, we used logistic regression with statsmodels [43]. A full list of illnesses classified as CVD, including hypertension and high cholesterol, is included in the supporting information (S2 Text).\nAfter removing participants with missing accelerometer data, or without at least 3 days of\ndata and with data in each one-hour period of the 24-hour cycle (scattered over multiple days), n = 1805 participants were included in the regression analysis.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333.g002\nPLOS Digital Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333 August 30, 2023 5 / 22\nFirstly, we classified the raw accelerometer data into SB, light PA, walking, moderate-to-vig-\norous PA (MVPA) and sleep with balanced random forests and Hidden Markov models (with the accelerometer package by [44]). Despite the participants being instructed to wear the accelerometer all the time, non-wear segments were present and were imputed using the average of similar time-of-day data points taken from different days of the week. Secondly, we partitioned the day into time spent in overall PA (including time spent in light PA, walking and MVPA), SB and sleep, and we included the accelerometer in the regression model with a compositional approach [45]. In a compositional framework, time spent in the three different activities is considered as a relative proportion of the overall time budget (24 hours), and thus conventional statistical methods cannot be employed with compositional data [46] due to the implied collinearity between the activities. Therefore, we used isometric log-ratio (ILR) transformation. The ILR regression coefficients were also used to estimate the minutes of activity required to reduce the log(odds) of CVD Details on the transformation can be found in the supporting information (S3 Text).\nThe effect of common confounders including age, WC, alcohol intake, income and smoking status as covariates was examined and the final model was selected with backwards selection\u2014only covariates reaching significance (p-value < 0.05) were retained in the final models. Since only WC, smoking status and age were significant covariates, participants with complete data for these variables were included in the analysis (n = 1805). Sensitivity analysis was done on a subset of participants with no missing data for all covariates (including alcohol intake and income) with n = 1615. Survival analysis. We assessed the effects of PA and SB on CVD onset in the different clusters with the Kaplan-Meyer Estimate. In order to predict survival time from PA and SB levels simultaneously, activity data was not transformed with ILR transformation and used as minutes/day. The time between birth and onset of CVD was used as the time-to-event of interest, with the event being diagnosis of CVD. The observations were censored at 68 years, and subjects that had not reached this age at the baseline visit were removed, leaving a sample size of n = 1215. Survival regression was further done to assess the effect of relevant risk factors on the survival time. Smoking, sex, age, triglycerides, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and WC were included as covariates in the models, as they are the most common predictors for CVD [47]. After examination of the partial residual plots, a non-linear term (age2T2D) and two interaction terms (PA\u00d7age and PA \u00d7 DBP) were included. All features were scaled to the [0, 1] range. Four models were compared with k-fold cross-validation (k=10, 100 iterations): Cox\u2019s proportional hazards, Weibull AFT, Log-logistic and Log-normal AFT models. The analysis was done with the Python lifelines package [48].\nThe selected model is then used in the recommender system to predict the survival time for\neach user and to communicate the risk of developing CVD in response to one\u2019s levels of PA and SB."

Firstly, we specified the target behaviour (i.e. increasing PA and reducing SB) and the associated factors through a literature review. Ovid and Embase databases were systematically searched to include studies identifying barriers and facilitators to the target behaviours, specifically in type 2 diabetes patients. We selected five studies [49\u201353] that identified factors associated with the target behaviours pertaining to all COM-B model domains (capability, opportunity and\nPLOS Digital Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333 August 30, 2023 6 / 22\nmotivation). The search terms and a summary of the selected papers are provided in the supporting information (S4 Text and S2 Table). All factors associated with the target behaviours that were identified by the selected papers are presented in Table 1, including those that cannot be addressed by a mHealth intervention (such as environmental factors), in order to have a more complete picture of the elements influencing physical behaviours in people with type 2 diabetes. Secondly, we mapped the identified factors to the COM-B model. And lastly, we identified behaviour change techniques through the help of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) [54], and we mapped them to system features. The design process is shown in Table 1.\nAccording to the COM-B model, an intervention must match the patient\u2019s abilities to be\neffective and sustained. Challenges recommended by the system have to align with the patients\u2019 skills and constantly adjust as these change over time. Therefore, in the proposed system, the recommendations are initialised to the patient\u2019s baseline activity and optimised over time depending on the probability of compliance and leptin levels. The probability of compliance with the recommendations is paramount to prevent feelings of failure in the patient, which can hinder engagement with the intervention. Moreover, PA and SB trends enable self-monitoring and self-regulation, which increase motivation. Finally, rewards are embedded in the system as a time-to-onset of comorbidities gained or lost in response to their new activity behaviour.\nClassification into diabetes cluster. The first component of the proposed system is the\nclassification of the patient into one of the diabetes clusters. To select the best classifier, three\nmodels\u2014K-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector classifier (SVC) and random forest (RF)\u2014were trained and validated on the clustering set (n = 26400). The test set was selected as the set of under-68 years old subjects (n = 348) later used in the prediction of survival times, as this set is used to simulate the system and thus should not be used to train the classifier.\nFor each of the three models, features were standardised and selected through forward\nsequential feature selection in mlxtend [55], using balanced accuracy as the selecting metric. The model hyperparameters were tuned with randomised search cross-validation, using the scikit-learn RandomizedSearchCV function which implements a fit and score method [40], with balanced accuracy being selected as the scoring method. The tuned models with the optimal number of features were then validated on the test set.\nOptimised recommendation module. The main component of the system is the recom-\nmendation module, which issues optimised recommendations to improve metabolic health while keeping the probability of compliance high. The core inputs for the recommendation module are leptin levels, probability of compliance, and upper and lower limit of PA and SB.\nLeptin varies in relation to dieting therapies and thus, leptin levels are a real-time physi-\nological signal providing feedback on the efficacy of the intervention. During diets, leptin levels change at a greater rate than weight and can predict weight loss two weeks in advance [56]. Therefore, monitoring leptin can be more meaningful than monitoring weight, and can be employed as feedback to adjust recommendations if future weight gain is predicted. Monitoring leptin levels is also relevant for chronic disease management, as hyperleptinemia is correlated to increased risk of obesity and cardiovascular outcomes in T2D patients [57].\nThe probability of compliance (Eq 1) is related to the historical levels of activity and\ntherefore, encodes the skill level of the patients. In order to keep compliance high, the recommendations are adjusted based on the proportion of recommendations followed in the past and their past activity levels. To include the effect of genetics on motivation, the recommendation score is also weighted by a polygenic risk score. The polygenic risk score is calculated using effect sizes reported by Doherty et al. [58] that quantify the association between selected Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) and PA or SB. Information on the selected SNP is given in Table 2.\nP\u00f0c\u00de \u00bc\nXR\ni\u00bc1\nfi\nR \ufffd \u00f01 jAr Apj\u00de \u00fe PRS\n\u00f01\u00de\nfi \u00bc 1; if recommendation followed\n0; otherwise\n(\n\u00f02\u00de\nR is the number of recommendations issued and PRS \u00bc PN\ni\u00bc1 gi \ufffd ei is the polygenic risk\nscore, where gi is the genotype and ei is the effect size corresponding to SNP i.

[59] (model in Eq 6, Fig 6A), who measured the percentage of participants who wore the activity tracker for at least 1 day in a week and by Meyer et al. [60] (model in Eq 7, Fig 6B), who recorded the average number of days in a week that participants wore the tracker. The parameters for both models were estimated with least squares [63]. The third model was time-invariant, with constant p over the duration of the intervention (Eq 8).\nP\u00f0X \u00bc 1\u00de \u00bc p\u00f0t; A; m1; m2; s1; s2\u00de\n\u00bc A p arctan t m1 s1\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\u00fe arctan t m2 s2\n\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd \u00f06\u00de\nP\u00f0X \u00bc 1\u00de \u00bc p\u00f0t; b1; b3; b3; b4; b5\u00de\n\u00bc b1t4 \u00fe b2t3 \u00fe b3t2 \u00fe b4t \u00fe b5 \u00f07\u00de\nP\u00f0X \u00bc 1\u00de \u00bc p with p \u00bc \u00f00; 1\u00de \u00f08\u00de\nThe resulting activity and adherence profiles for the young dataset are presented in Fig 7. Within the young dataset, four participants had follow-up accelerometer data available,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333.t006\nKNN: K-nearest neighbours, SVC: Support vector classification, RF: Random forest\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333.t007\nPLOS Digital Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333 August 30, 2023 13 / 22\ncollected on average approximately 1.5 years after the baseline measurements. Consequently, it was possible to compare the activity at follow-up with the simulated activity at a time matching the time difference between baseline and follow-up measurements. Fig 8 shows that, although only a constantly high adherence (p = 0.8) to the intervention would bring significant improvements in activity compared to baseline, all adherence models achieved improvements compared to activity measured at follow-up. For PA, such difference was statistically significant for all models evaluated (p-value < 0.05, tested with paired t-test)."

            "text": "In this paper, we presented a novel analysis of T2D clusters and their associations with physical behaviours and CVD. We found four clusters phenotypically distinct clusters of T2D based on 16 cardiometabolic markers routinely measured in clinical settings. The clustering confirms the presence of different types of diabetes characterised by different cardiometabolic profiles.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333.g006\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333.g007\nPLOS Digital Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333 August 30, 2023 14 / 22\nThe clusters found in this analysis resemble the clusters found by Ahlqvist et al. [15]. They found one cluster which was insulin-dependent, with low BMI and poor metabolic control (similar to cluster 1); and other two clusters with higher onset age, no insulin resistance and with obesity (similar to clusters 3 and 4). However, compared to the clusters found by Ahlqvist et al., the clusters described here did not present differences in glucose metabolism (especially hbA1c), but rather highlight the differences in overall cardiometabolic health, suggesting that the differences in diabetes clusters may be a product of lifestyle differences. This hypothesis is supported by different levels of physical behaviours between the clusters: cluster 1 spend less time sedentary compared to the sample average and more time engaging in physical activity compared to the sample average. Conversely, clusters 3 and 4 are the most sedentary and least active clusters. This analysis suggests that people with T2D may benefit from individualised behavioural change interventions depending on their cardiometabolic profile and their T2D subtype.\nConsequently, in this paper we present a new knowledge-based system for personalised\nactivity recommendations. The system aims to increase PA and reduce SB in people with T2D by providing recommendations with a high chance of compliance based on the patient\u2019s T2D cluster, previous activity, genetic risk and leptin levels. We trained and simulated the system using data from the UK Biobank and demonstrated that the system may help increase levels of activity. In fact, simulating the system with different probabilities of adherence showed improved physical activity compared to real-life activity measured after 1.5 years from baseline. Despite testing the system with computer simulations, we modelled the behavioural response to the system using real data collected on human\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333.g008\nPLOS Digital Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333 August 30, 2023 15 / 22\nparticipants by [59] and [60], who recorded the weekly wear of an activity tracker for 52 weeks. While these data are suitable for initial assessment, implementation of the system as a real-life intervention and user testing are needed to reliably assess the effectiveness of the system.\nThe novelty of the presented work lies in the adoption of a holistic approach to behav-\niour change interventions: in fact, we used a wide array of data\u2014including biomarkers, genotype, leptin levels and past activity\u2014to achieve highly personalised recommendations. A novel concept in our work is the use of genetic information to optimise the personalised recommendations. Genetic risk communication has been previously used for lifestyle behaviour change interventions, but has been found to have a very small effect on reducing unhealthy behaviours such as smoking, physical activity and nutrition [64]. However, to our knowledge, no intervention has been developed that uses genetic markers associated with the target behaviour. The inclusion of such markers may contribute to improving lifestyle behaviours because, in our system, genetic information is related to the capability of the subject. On the other hand, previous interventions have mapped genetic information to motivation and specifically to the knowledge of the risks associated to a poor lifestyle. Future research should confirm whether genetic associations can be used to directly inform lifestyle recommendations and achieve a significant change in lifestyle behaviours."

            "heading": "Limitations of the current work",
            "text": "This work presents several limitations. Firstly, the behavioural analysis is limited as it only employed findings from a literature review, while conducting new qualitative research with the target population could have provided further insights into barriers and facilitators of the target behaviour, specifically in regard to mHealth interventions. Nonetheless, it is possible to improve the behavioural analysis by conducting focus groups or semi-structured interviews with the target population and incorporating the results in future versions of the proposed system.\nThe system is evaluated through computer simulations rather than through a randomised\ncontrolled trial, which is the gold standard to assess the efficacy of an intervention [65]. A direct consequence is the impossibility of implementing features, such as goal customisation, which require the user\u2019s input. Additionally, at this stage, it is not possible to assess the system\u2019s user-friendliness and how it would impact the acceptance and efficacy of the intervention. It is also not possible to assess whether communicating the risk of developing CVD is the best way to increase motivation, and other rewards may be more effective. Additionally, several issues can undermine the efficacy of the system in real-life settings, which could not be accounted for in simulations. Firstly, the engagement with the system is currently modelled with time-changing probability distributions, which may be different from the real-world adherence to the system\u2019s recommendations. Secondly, simulations cannot capture the individual variation in leptin levels in different individuals and the response to different types of physical activity. Therefore, modelling leptin can introduce errors in the optimisation of recommendations and thus in the efficacy simulations. Thirdly, simulations cannot account for all the factors that may affect users\u2019 activity and behaviour and therefore, the system efficacy may be invalidated in free-living settings.\nA further limitation of the current system version is the use of overall activity, which combines any activity not classified as sedentary time or sleep. Classifying activities based on type and intensity may be more beneficial for the user as it can provide a more precise indication of which kind of activity one should replace sedentary time with.\nPLOS Digital Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pdig.0000333 August 30, 2023 16 / 22"

            "heading": "Considerations for real-world implementation",
            "text": "The promising results presented in this paper warrant the implementation of the system into a real-life intervention, whose efficacy can be tested with a randomised controlled trial. To implement the intervention, the system would be integrated with a point-of-care test for leptin, which we presented in previous works [66, 67]. Additionally, the recommendations can be augmented with information on activity mode and duration, which are especially important when dealing with cardiometabolic conditions that require special considerations due to the associated risks. Additional gamification features, such as goal setting and scoreboards, can be integrated into the system to render the system customisable by the user and increase self-efficacy. As data availability increases and new features are added to the system, data can be represented using knowledge graphs to capture complex relationships and better integrate data from different sources. Specifically, a personal knowledge graph [68] would be used to define structural relationships between the patient and their data, which can then be used to improve recommendations, infer missing data, and predict disease risk.\nHowever, before implementing the system into a real-world intervention, several consider-\nations have to be made. While personalisation promotes acceptance of mHealth services [69], it also raises privacy and data security concerns. Tangari et al. [70] found that very few mHealth apps respect user privacy\u201388% of apps found in the major app stores can access and share personal data. As the present system relies on sensitive health data, its implementation must ensure privacy and user data security by using encrypted HTTP traffic and encrypting the data stored in the user\u2019s device. Therefore, while mHealth applications often present a lack of data security, ensuring a high level of data protection is achievable in order to optimise the risk-benefit trade-off of mHealth interventions.\nOnce the initial implementation of the mHealth system is completed according to the best\ndata protection practices, a first round of user testing should be conducted to assess the system\u2019s usability, perceived benefits, and prospective acceptability. Subsequently, the system should be updated to reflect the feedback collected during the user trial. Finally, a randomised controlled trial would assess the efficacy of the proposed system, which is a first attempt at providing comprehensive and highly personalised activity recommendations by linking sensing data with genetics and daily tracking. If proved effective and acceptable in real-life settings, implementation of such theories could have a major impact in the prevention and management of chronic diseases that are triggered by behavioural practices."
