1. **Investigate the potential of C. nutans extracts to inhibit the replication of other enveloped viruses, such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).** This could be done by conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the antiviral activity of C. nutans extracts against these viruses.


2. **Explore the mechanisms by which C. nutans extracts exert their antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities.** This could be done by conducting mechanistic studies to identify the specific molecular targets of C. nutans phytochemicals and to elucidate the signaling pathways involved in their biological activities.


3. **Develop standardized protocols for the preparation of C. nutans extracts to ensure consistency and quality in their production.** This could involve optimizing the extraction conditions, such as the type of solvent, extraction temperature, and extraction time, to maximize the yield and bioactivity of the extracts.


4. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of C. nutans extracts in the treatment of viral infections, inflammatory diseases, and immune disorders.** This could involve conducting randomized controlled trials to compare the effects of C. nutans extracts to standard treatments or placebo in patients with these conditions.


5. **Investigate the potential of C. nutans extracts to enhance the efficacy of existing antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory drugs.** This could be done by conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the synergistic effects of C. nutans extracts with these drugs.
