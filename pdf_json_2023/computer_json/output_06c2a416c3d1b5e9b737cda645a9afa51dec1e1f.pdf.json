    "abstractText": "Cascaded inverse fast Fourier transform/fast Fourier transform (IFFT/FFT)-based multichannel aggregation/de-aggregation offers a promising solution in constructing highly desirable flexible optical transceivers for considerably improving optical networks\u2019 elasticity, flexibility, and adaptability. However, the multi-channel aggregation operation unavoidably results in generated signals having high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs). To solve this technical challenge, this paper first explores the PAPR characteristics of the corresponding flexible transceivers in optical backto-back (B2B) and 20 km intensity modulation and direct detection (IMDD) transmission systems, and then numerically investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of utilizing the conventional clipping techniques in reducing their PAPR reductions. The results show that the last IFFT operation size is the primary factor determining the PAPRs rather than the channel count and modulation format. For a given last IFFT operation size, the optimal clipping ratio can be identified, which is independent of channel count. With the identified optimal clipping ratio, when the channel count is >4, every two-channel increase in the channel count can only lead to <1.2 Gb/s decreases in the maximum aggregated signal transmission capacity.",

In the practical implementations of the highly desirable flexible transceivers, cost-effective DSP-based multi-channel aggregation and de-aggregation techniques are employed to flexibly and dynamically aggregate and de-aggregate multiple independent channels of various line rates according to actual end-user requirements. For existing DSP-based multi-channel aggregation and de-aggregation techniques, multi-channel aggregation/de-aggregation can be realized with a single inverse fast Fourier transform/fast Fourier transform (IFFT/FFT) operation [2\u20134], a digital filtering operation [5\u20138], and code-division multiplexing [9,10].

However, for the cascaded IFFT/FFT-based multi-channel aggregation/de-aggregation technique, aggregating multiple independent channels with each channel containing multiple subcarriers unavoidably leads to high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs). High PAPRs not only require large dynamic ranges of electrical/optical devices but also impose enhanced sensitivity to optical fiber nonlinearity [12\u201314]. Therefore, it is essential to explore the PAPR characteristics of flexible transceivers incorporating the cascaded IFFT/FFT-based multi-channel aggregation/de-aggregation techniques, in order to further explore simple and effective solutions to considerably reduce PAPRs. To effectively address the high PAPR issues associated with flexible transceivers incorporating the cascaded IFFT/FFT-based multi-channel aggregation/de-aggregation techniques, in this paper, we identify, for the first time, the key parameters determining the PAPRs of the flexible transceivers and, in a 20 km point-to-point (P2P) intensity modulation and direct detection (IMDD) transmission system, numerically explore the feasibility and effectiveness of conventional clipping technique-induced PAPR reductions as well as their resultant impacts on both transmission performance and maximum achievable aggregated transmission capacity. The results indicate that for the considered P2P flexible transceivers, the PAPRs are primarily determined by the last IFFT size of the cascaded IFFT operations, which is independent of channel count and modulation format. In comparison with the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals, the P2P flexible transceiverproduced signals have ~0.3 dB PAPR reductions due to the frequency\u2013time domain-mixed channel aggregations. For the P2P flexible transceivers, the clipping operation can effectively reduce the PAPRs, and more importantly, the optimal clipping ratio is independent of channel count when the last IFFT operation size is fixed. When using the identified optimal clipping ratio, every two-channel increase in the channel count only gives rise to <1.2 Gb/s reductions in the maximum aggregated transmission capacity when the channel count exceeds 4. This paper is constructed as follows: The operating principle of the flexible transceivers in P2P transmission systems (P2P flexible transceivers) is presented in Section 2. The PAPR characteristics of the P2P flexible transceivers are explored in Section 3.

Multi-Channel Aggregation and Clipping Operations in Transmitter DSP In the transmitter, a complex-valued baseband signal containing R independent channels is generated using the cascaded IFFT-enabled multi-channel aggregation technique, as illustrated in Figure 2a. Implementing (R \u2212 1) cascaded IFFT operations can aggregate R independent channels.

W is the aggregated signal size for the (r \u2212 1)-th IFFT operation. Equation (1) indicates that the r-th IFFT operation size doubles the size of the (r \u2212 1)-th IFFT operation. As seen in Figure 2b, for the (r \u2212 1)-th IFFT operation, the two input signals to be aggregated are A = [a0, a1, \u2026, aW\u22121] and B = [b0, b1, \u2026, bW\u22121], where signal A presents the output of the (r \u2212 2)-th IFFT operation, and B is the input signal aggregated by the (r \u2212 1)- th IFFT operation.

The resulting clipping ratio is defined as\nCR = 20log10( Amax E [ |x i(t)| 2 ] ), (3)\nwhere E[\u00b7] denotes the expectation operation. It should be mentioned that as seen in Figure 1, the analog in-phase and quadrature (IQ) mixers are used to locate the produced baseband complex signal to a desirable radio frequency (RF) spectral region, which can be described as\nyi(t) = Re[si(t)]\u2297 cos 2\u03c0 fct + Im[si(t)]\u2297 sin 2\u03c0 fct (4)\nwhere Re[si(t)] and Im[si(t)] denote the real and imaginary parts of the produced complexvalued signal si(t), respectively. fc represents the central frequency of the sinusoidal signals. Finally, after intensity modulation, an optical signal is produced and then fed into an optical iber. For the flexible transceivers, each channel contains multiple independent subcarriers and the number of subcarriers is determined by its corresponding IFFT operation size as presented in Equation (1). The subcarrier modulation format can use M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and/or phase shift keying (PSK), which is similar to conventional OFDM techniques. As such, in generating the subcarriers of each channel, conventional OFDM modulation techniques can be utilized, including the bit-loading techniques for adaptively adjusting each subcarrier\u2019s modulation format and bitrate according to actual use requirements and channel transmission characteristics."

After low-pass filters (LPFs), analogue-to-digital conversion (ADC), serialto-parallel operations (S/P), and CP removals, the cascaded FFT-based multi-channel de-aggregation operation is then performed in the receiver DSP. As illustrated in Figure 3a, separating R channels requires implementing (R \u2212 1) two-signal de-aggregation operations. Each two-signal de-aggregation requires a single FFT operation. To separate the r-th channel, as depicted in Figure 3b, the input of the corresponding two-signal de-aggregation operation is C\u2032 = [c\u20320, . . ., c\u2032W\u22121, c\u2032W, . . ., c\u20322W\u22121], and after the FFT operation, the signal D = [d0, . . ., dW\u22121, dW, . . ., d2W\u22121] can be obtained.

Signal B\u2032 is the received signal transmitted over the r-th channel, and signal A\u2032 is the input to the (r \u2212 1)-th two-signal de-aggregation operation. Detailed principles of the cascaded IFFT/FFT-based multi-channel aggregation/de-aggregation technique can be found in [11]. In the cascaded IFFT/FFT-based multi-channel aggregation/de-aggregation process, each IFFT (FFT) operation will aggregate (separate) a new channel into (from) the transmitted (received) signal. Such multi-channel aggregation and de-aggregation process is independent of signal modulation formats. Due to IFFT/FFT operation features, the aggregated multiple independent channels are multiplexed in both the time domain and the frequency domain, thus offering additional physical layer network security [11]. By activating/de-activating the corresponding IFFT/FFT operations, an arbitrary number of independent channels, each tailored to a specific application/service, can be aggregated and de-aggregated. Detailed explanations of the flexible transceiver-adopted IFFT/FFT-based multi-channel aggregation/de-aggregation process can be found in [11]."

The impacts of variations in clipping ratio and quantization bit on the P2P flexible transceivers transmitting four independent channels over 20 km standard single-mode fibers (SSMFs) are, respectively, explored and shown in Figure 6a,b. The key parameters of the 20 km IMDD transmission systems are given in Table 1. In calculating Figure 6a, a quantization bit of 8 is considered. The received optical power is \u22122 dBm. As shown in the figure, the bit error ratios (BERs) of all the considered channels reach the lowest value at the optimal clipping ratio of 11 dB. For the clipping ratios of <11 dB, a decreasing clipping ratio leads to considerable signal distortions, thus resulting in nonnegligible BER performance degradations [15]. In contrast. when clipping ratios are >11 dB, as discussed in Section 5.2, insufficient signal clipping results in high PAPRs and large carrier-to-signal power ratios (CSPRs), thus finally leading to effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) reductions and BER performance degradations.

Optimal Clipping Ratio and Quantization Bits To maximize the achievable transmission performance of the P2P flexible transceiver, the optimal clipping ratio and quantization bit of the DAC/ADCs are identified. The impacts of variations in clipping ratio and quantization bit on the P2P flexible transceivers transmitting four independent channels over 20 km standard single-mode fibers (SSMFs) are, respectively, explored and shown in Figure 6a,b. The key parameters of the 20 km IMDD transmission systems are given in Table 1. In calculating Figure 6a, a quantization bit of 8 is considered. The received optical power is \u22122 dBm. As shown in the figure, the bit error ratios (BERs) of all the considered channels reach the lowest value at the optimal clipping ratio of 11 dB. For the clipping ratios of <11 dB, a decreasing clipping ratio leads to considerable signal distortions, thus resulting in nonnegligible BER performance degradations [15].
