A precancer atlas creates \u201ca map of all the cellular and molecular changes in a precancerous lesion,\u201d explains Avrum Spira, MD, MSc, of Johnson & Johnson and Boston Medical Center in Massachusetts, who discussed the concept at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2022 in New Orleans, LA, held April 8\u201313. The atlas can show \u201cmolecular changes [in] all the cells in that lesion\u201d and \u201chow those changes evolve over time as the lesion either progresses to or regresses away from cancer.\u201d Compiling spatial and genomic information into a map helps assign identities to single cells within these lesions, provides insight into how the microenvironment is organized, and shows how this organization could impact cancer development. Although \u201catlases are not hypothesis testing, they generate hypotheses,\u201d Spira said. Spira and his team investigated the immune microenvironment in the early development of squamous lung cancer. Through a pilot precancer atlas, they found that in premalignant lesions with a lower chance of developing into invasive cancer, \u201cthere\u2019s a much higher number of immune cells, specifically CD8+ T cells,\u201d Spira said. This \u201csuggests the immune microenvironment may be a determinant of premalignant lung [cancer] progression.\u201d The team subsequently performed miRNA sequencing \u201cto see which miRNAs specifically acted on immune genes,\u201d says Jennifer Beane, PhD, of Boston University. An analysis by bioinformatics graduate student Boting Ning suggests that miRNA149-5p is overexpressed in progressive premalignant lesions and downregulates NLRC5. \u201cBy suppressing NLRC5, MHC1 genes are suppressed and CD8+ T cells are not recruited to the epithelium,\u201d explains Beane. The anticorrelation between miRNA-149-5p and NLRC5 is thought to eliminate antigen presentation to immune cells, allowing oncogenic mutations to go unnoticed. Researchers are investigating this hypothesis in preclinical models. Spira and his colleagues are not the only group using a precancer atlas to evaluate disease development. Researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School (HMS), and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, all in Boston, explored the use of an early-stage precancer atlas to examine immune system shifts in premalignant melanoma lesions. Although further investigation is needed to corroborate the findings, the team hypothesizes that some melanoma immunosuppressive mechanisms consist of immune cell types acting on one another rather than cancer cells. \u201cWe think it\u2019s macrophages and dendritic cells suppressing T cells, not tumor cells suppressing T cells,\u201d says Peter Sorger, PhD, of HMS. In other words, it\u2019s estimated that the \u201ctumor can attract macrophages and put them into a state where they\u2019re immunosuppressive.\u201d A precancer atlas \u201ccan visually discriminate where the immune system is having success and where it\u2019s failing,\u201d adds Sandro Santagata, MD, PhD, of Brigham and Women\u2019s. The team is using the maps of early-stage melanoma to find mechanisms that support successful immune responses, which they \u201chope to translate into better treatments for patients.\u201d Both research initiatives show the potential of a precancer atlas in developing hypotheses about precancerous lesions and their microenvironments, but the tool\u2019s routine use isn\u2019t around the corner. \u201cThe Cancer Genome Atlas took more than a decade from inception before we saw it benefiting patients,\u201d Spira said. \u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of the precancer atlas journey.\u201d \u2013Natalie DiDomenico \u25a0",

The current assortment of 23 medicines and vaccines, which are patented in the United States or the European Union, treat some infectious, rare, and inflammatory diseases, as well as certain leukemias, breast cancers, and kidney cancers.\nAtara Biotherapeutics and Bayer will end their $670 million exclusive worldwide licensing agreement for nextgeneration mesothelin-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies. The collaboration included the development and funding of ATA3271, an armored allogeneic T-cell immunotherapy, and an autologous version, ATA2271, for high mesothelin\u2013expressing tumors.\nFederal agencies, Congress, and others need to improve representation of minority groups and underrepresented populations in clinical trials, according to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM 2022 May 17 [Epub ahead of print]). Lack of representation may limit access to medical interventions and new therapies for some patients and increase health disparities, which could cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 30 years.\nIn a phase I trial, Caribou Biosciences\u2019 CAR T-cell therapy, CB-010, demonstrated an overall response rate of 100% in all five evaluable patients with relapsed/ refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); 80% experienced a complete response (CR) lasting up to 6 months. Caribou says that \u201cCB-010 is the first allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in the clinic with a PD-1 knockout, a genome-editing strategy designed to limit premature CAR T-cell exhaustion.\u201d\nNkarta reported that two of its CAR natural killer (NK) cell therapies, NKX101 and NKX019, showed promising efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and NHL. NKX101, which targets NKG2D, induced a CR rate of 60% with full hematologic recovery among five patients with relapsed/refractory AML. With NKX019, which targets CD19, the CR rate was 50% and the objective response rate was 83% among six patients with NHL.\ndoi: 10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-7-NOTED For more news on cancer research, visit Cancer Discovery online at http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/ CDNews.\nD ow nloaded from http://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article-pdf/12/7/1605/3176441/1605.pdf by guest on 18 January 2024"
