We show that such a periodic system leads to significant differences compared to the classical plane geometry. In particular, we highlight the observation of subsonic elevation solitons, and a nonlinear dependence of the soliton velocity on its amplitude. The soliton profile, velocity, collision, and dissipation are characterized using high resolution space-time measurements. By imposing periodic boundary conditions onto Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, we recover these observations. A nonlinear spectral analysis of solitons (periodic inverse scattering transform) is also implemented and experimentally validated in this periodic geometry. Our work thus reveals the importance of periodicity for studying solitons and could be applied to other fields involving periodic systems governed by a KdV equation. Introduction. \u2013 Since their first observation on the surface of water [1], solitons have been widely studied in various domains (including acoustics [2], plasmas [3], carbon nanotubes [4], Bose\u2013Einstein condensates [5, 6], or blood vessels of living organisms [7]). Korteweg and de Vries (KdV) first provided an analytical description of solitons [8], which can be observed as either waves of elevation [9] or depression [10] on the surface of a fluid. Although KdV solitons have mainly been investigated experimentally in rectilinear geometries [9\u201313], examples in both curved and periodic media remain elusive. A stable torus of fluid is a good experimental system to study solitons in a curved and periodic geometry. We manage to create such a stable torus of liquid by means of an original technique. We have previously studied linear waves propagating along the inner and outer torus borders [14]. Here, using this technique, we experimentally discover unreported periodic KdV solitons along a stable torus of liquid whose properties are fully characterized (profile, velocity, collision, and dissipation), and described with an experimentally validated model taking into account both the curved and periodic conditions. Our work thus paves the way to observe other nonlinear phenomena such as wave turbulence [15, 16], and soliton gas [17\u201321] in this specific geometry. Note that KdV solitons can be (a)filip.novkoski@u-paris.fr (b)chi-tuong.pham@upsaclay.fr (c)eric.falcon@u-paris.fr (corresponding author) reached experimentally in curved geometries without periodicity (e.g., along the border of a liquid cylinder [22\u201324]), whereas trials have been attempted for periodic conditions in plane geometry (e.g., in an annular water tank [25,26]), as well as for a curved and periodic system but only in a nonstationary regime and by applying a strong constraint to the liquid ring [27\u201329]. Theoretical works on solitons have yielded advanced mathematical techniques to study solutions to various integrable nonlinear equations [e.g., KdV, Nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger (NLS), Kadomtsev-Petviashvili], in particular the inverse scattering transform (IST) [30\u201333]. This nonlinear spectral analysis has been applied to experimental NLS solitons [21, 33], but remain scarce for KdV ones [34\u201336], and, so far, have not been applied to a periodic experimental system, a more complex setting which has recently received numerical and theoretical attention [33,37\u201339]. Experimental setup. \u2013 We manage to create a stable torus of fluid by depositing distilled water on a superhydrophobic duralumin plate machined with a slightly sloping triangular groove along the perimeter (see fig. 1ac) [14]. The radius of the groove center, R, is either 4 cm or 7 cm using two different substrates. The small angle \u03b1 of the groove to the horizontal is 4.5\u25e6. We use a commercial superhydrophobic coating yielding a contact angle of 160\u25e6\u2013170\u25e6 between liquid and substrate [14, 40] p-1 ar X iv :2 20 4. 11 49 0v 2 [ nl in .P S] 2 2 Ju n 20 22 Filip Novkoski, Chi-Tuong Pham and Eric Falcon",

The radius of the groove center, R, is either 4 cm or 7 cm using two different substrates. The small angle \u03b1 of the groove to the horizontal is 4.5\u25e6. We use a commercial superhydrophobic coating yielding a contact angle of 160\u25e6\u2013170\u25e6 between liquid and substrate [14, 40]\np-1\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n11 49\n0v 2\n[ nl\nin .P\nS] 2\n2 Ju\nn 20\n22\nallowing the liquid torus to move with almost no constraint. To generate waves, the torus is impulse pulled (or pushed) horizontally using a linear actuator with a teflon plate attached to its end (see fig. 1a). By deforming the meniscus, the actuator creates two counterpropagating solitons along the outer, and two along the inner, border of the torus (see fig. 1b and movies in Supp. Mat. [41]). A camera located above the torus records the displacements of the two interfaces. Using a border detection algorithm [42], we extract the azimuthal displacement \u03b7(\u03b8, t), in the horizontal plane, of both the inner and outer torus borders. Measurements are made for various pulse amplitudes and for different torus widths, W , by adding water. We set \u03c7 = Ro/R in order to quantify the system curvature, with Ro the outer radius of the torus, and Ro = R +W/2 with W the torus width (see fig. 1a). KdV solitons in the toroidal geometry will be characterized using the R = 7 cm case. The effects of periodicity on the solitons will be evidenced by decreasing the radius to R = 4 cm.\nSoliton solutions. \u2013 When weak dispersion is balanced by weak nonlinearity in a shallow water regime, azimuthal waves \u03b7(\u03b8, t) along a torus of fluid are governed at the leading order by an ad hoc KdV equation with periodic\nboundary conditions as\n\u03b7t + \u21260 [ \u03b7\u03b8 + 5\u03c72\n4W\u0303 \u03b7\u03b7\u03b8 +\n\u03c72W\u0303 2\n2R2 \u03b4Bo\u03b7\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8\n] = 0 , (1)\nwith W\u0303 = W/2, \u03b4Bo = Boc \u2212 Bo, and \u21260 = (geffW\u0303 )1/2/R the angular phase velocity of linear gravity waves. The Bond number reads Bo = `2eff/(W\u0303\n2\u03c74), Boc \u2248 1/6, where `eff \u2261 \u221a \u03c3eff/(\u03c1geff) is the effective capillary length, \u03c1 = 103 kg m\u22123 is the fluid density, geff = g sin\u03b1 is the effective gravity, and g = 9.81 m s\u22122. \u03c3eff ' 60 mN m\u22121 is an effective surface tension inferred from the low-amplitude (linear regime) measurement of the dispersion relation. geff and \u03c3eff are strongly linked to the substrate geometry and renormalization effects [24]. We obtain eq. (1) using a Taylor expansion of the gravity-capillary dispersion relation along a liquid torus [14], and adapting nonlinear corrections introduced in [24] for a rectilinear fluid cylinder to our torus geometry (see Supp. Mat [41]).\nCnoidal wave solutions to eq. (1) read\n\u03b7(\u03b8, t) = A cn2 ( \u03b8 \u2212 \u2126t \u2206 \u221a m \u2223\u2223\u2223m) with \u22062 = 24 5 W\u0303 3 AR2 \u03b4Bo, (2)\nwhere A is the (signed) amplitude and \u2206 the (angular) width of the solitary wave. The sign of A is given by that of \u03b4Bo. The velocity of the soliton of eq. (2) reads\n\u2126 = \u21260\n[ 1 + 5A 6W\u0303m \u03c72 ( 1\u2212 m 2 \u2212 3 E(m) 2 K(m) )] . (3)\nK(m) [resp. E(m)] is the complete elliptic integral of the first (resp. second) kind. m \u2208 [0, 1] is the elliptic parameter for which the cnoidal function cn(\u03b8|m) is cos(\u03b8) for m = 0, and sech(\u03b8) for m = 1 [13, 44]. Although the cnoidal wave is a periodic function, the 2\u03c0-periodicity condition on the circle (i.e., torus border) still has to be ensured, and reads\n2\u03c0\nN\u03b8\u2206 = 4K(m), i .e., \u03c0 = 2N\u03b8\n\u221a 6W\u0303 3m\u03b4Bo\n5R2A K(m) , (4)\nwith N\u03b8 the number of solitons. The parameter m and the amplitude A have thus a nontrivial relationship (see below). The periodic elliptic solutions of eq. (2) are close to sech2 for large enough R (e.g., for R = 7 cm, 1\u2212m ' 10\u221212). In that case, eqs. (2) and (3) reduce to the classical solitary wave profile \u03b7(\u03b8, t) = A sech2[(\u03b8\u2212\u2126t)/\u2206] and velocity \u2126 = \u21260[1 + 5A\u03c7\n2/(12W\u0303 )]. However, for smaller R (e.g. 4 cm), this classical solution cannot be used since the effect of periodicity, through eq. (4), has to be taken into account (see below). Note that the experimental parameters used here are in the range of validity required for the derivation of eq. (1) assuming weak dispersion \u00b5 = W\u0303 2\u03c72\u03b4Bo/(\u2206 2R2) \u2208 [0.05, 0.3] 1 (i.e., shallow-water limit), weak nonlinearity = A\u03c72/W\u0303 \u2208 [0.005, 0.2] 1, both of the same order of magnitude \u00b5/ = W\u0303 3/(\u22062R2A) \u2208 [1, 3].\np-2\nSoliton profile. \u2013 The pulse profile, \u03b7(\u03b8, t), is extracted from the outer torus border (e.g., from the depression in fig. 1b). Figure 2a shows that the experimental profile is well described by the theoretical soliton profile of eq. (2) with no fitting parameter. Since a soliton balances theoretically dispersion and nonlinearity, it should also have a self-similar profile during its propagation. Figure 2b shows the superimposed rescaled profiles of a soliton during its propagation along almost one torus perimeter. The soliton (with this appropriate rescaling) thus conserves a self-similar shape during its propagation that is well described by eq. (2), even if its amplitude decreases due to unavoidable dissipation. To quantify the latter, we plot in fig. 2c the soliton amplitude as a function of time, A(t), during two rounds along the torus. A(t)/A(0) is found to decrease exponentially as A(t) = A(0) exp[\u2212t/\u03c4 ], with a damping time \u03c4 found to be independent of the viscosity of the fluid used (\u03bd \u2208 [10\u22127, 10\u22126] m2/s, i.e., mercury or water). This suggests that dissipation does not come from viscous dissipation, but probably from the pinning of the triple contact line [43]. Indeed, the capillary number Ca = \u03c1\u03bd\u2126R/\u03c3eff \u2208 [10\u22126, 10\u22123] leads to dominant interfacial forces with respect to viscous ones.\nFourier spectrum. \u2013 We now compute the spaceand-time Fourier transform, \u03b7\u0303(k\u03b8, \u03c9), of the signal \u03b7(\u03b8, t) as shown in fig. 3. The energy is found to be concentrated around a line of slope \u2126 = \u03c9/k\u03b8 corresponding to the pulse velocity. This quasi-nondispersive feature is a spectral signature of a soliton. The soliton velocity, \u2126, is found to be slightly slower than long linear waves propagating at velocity \u21260 (see fig. 3), meaning the presence of a subsonic soliton. Note that a broadening of the soliton\nbranch occurs due to nonlinearities, whereas low-intensity vertical traces (at low k\u03b8) correspond to mechanical noise.\nSoliton width and velocity. \u2013 We now measure the typical soliton width \u2206 by fitting eq. (2) to the experimental profile (as in fig. 2a). \u22062 is plotted in fig. 4 for different pulse amplitudes, A, and torus widths W . \u2206 is found to scale as \u221a W 3/A in good agreement with eq. (2)b with no fitting parameter (see solid line), thus justifying our ad hoc model that will lead to further predictions (see below). We also measure the soliton velocity by time of flight during its propagation. The dimensionless pulse velocity, \u2126/\u2126o (i.e., Froude number), is displayed in fig. 5 for various A\np-3\nand W . For large tori (i.e., using the substrate R = 7 cm for variousW ), the soliton velocity of eq. (3) reduces to the classical KdV linear relationship, \u2126/\u21260 = 1+5A\u03c7 2/(12W\u0303 ) (see solid line), which is well verified experimentally (open circles). Depression solitons (A < 0) moving slower than linear waves (\u2126/\u21260 < 1 or subsonic) are observed for Bo > Boc, whereas elevation solitons (A > 0) are supersonic (\u2126/\u21260 > 1) for 0 \u2264 Bo < Boc, as predicted for KdV in straight geometry [8, 10]. For smaller tori (i.e., R = 4 cm substrate), the relationship of eq. (3) between velocity and amplitude is no longer linear (see dashed lines from eq. (3) for different W ). In particular, we clearly observe subsonic elevation solitons due to the effects of the periodic geometry (see + in the bottom right quadrant).\nPeriodicity effects on the soliton velocity. \u2013 The transition from subsonic to supersonic solitons occurs, from eq. (3), at m\u2217 = 2\u2212 3E(m\u2217)/K(m\u2217) ' 0.96 regardless of Bo. This leads to different solutions of the periodic KdV equation as follows\n\u03b4Bo Type 0 < m < m \u2217 m\u2217 < m < 1 > 0 Elevation Subsonic Supersonic < 0 Depression Supersonic Subsonic\nAn additional effect of the periodicity condition eq. (4) is that certain types of solitons are unreachable experimentally due to our finite ranges of W and of A. This can be seen by plotting the dependence of the soliton amplitude A on the elliptic parameter m, A/W = 3 5mK 2(m)\u03b4Bo ( N\u03b8W \u03c0R )2 from eq. (4), as shown in fig. 6 for different widths W for which elevation solitons are observed. Due to the finite size of the torus, the soliton amplitude is experimentally limited typically to A/W < 0.2. As m increases with A, this also limits the reachable values of m, and thus the experimentally reachable solution\ntypes, as corroborated by the results of fig. 5 (e.g., no observation of elevation supersonic soliton for R = 4 cm). An equivalent plot to fig. 6 can be obtained for the depression soliton case (\u03b4Bo < 0, i.e., Bo > Boc) provided that the subsonic and supersonic regions are swapped.\np-4\nFigure 7 sums up the experimentally observable cases in a phase diagram in the (R,W ) parameter space. Inserting the experimental maximal soliton amplitude A/W = 0.2, and m = 0.999 [separating cnoidal soliton solutions (m < 0.999) from quasi-sech ones (m > 0.999)], into the periodicity condition of eq. (4) leads to green regions for cnoidal soliton solutions and salmon-pink one for quasi-sech solutions. The experimental data for small tori (R = 4 cm) fall in both the cnoidal and quasi-sech regions whereas those for a large tori (R = 7 cm) fall completely in the quasi-sech region, justifying well the velocity observations in fig. 5. Note that, for m far from 1, we still refer to solutions as solitons since they experimentally propagate around the torus as solitary waves and undergo nonlinear interaction, although displaying a nontrivial amplitude dependence velocity (see fig. 5). It is worth noting that, according to eq. (4), the limit of m = 1 is unreachable under periodic conditions since it would require an infinite amplitude.\nCritical Bond number. \u2013 The critical Bond number corresponds to the transition between elevation and depression soliton solutions [10]. It is remarkable that the theoretical value of the critical Bond number Boc \u2248 1/6 for a torus (see Supp. Mat. [41]) differs from the value 1/3 for the plane geometry case [8]. Indeed, Boc strongly depends on the substrate slope \u03b1 as found numerically [24]. Equating the Bond expression to 1/6 and inserting W\u0303 = Ro\u2212R, we find the critical outer radius Rco of the torus separating elevation and depression solitons as Rco 3 \u2212 Rco2R \u2212 \u221a 6`effR 2 = 0, and thus Rco = 8.43 cm for our parameters. Experimentally, we have a range of Bo \u2208 [0.09, 0.5] by varying Ro, and we look for the occurrence of the transition from depression (Ro < R c o) to elevation (Ro > R c o) solitons by increasing Ro. For small\nRo, depression solitons are indeed observed, whereas elevation solitons are detected above a certain radius. We find a critical experimental radius of Rco = 8.4 \u00b1 0.02 cm in good agreement with the above predictions. This corresponds to Boc = 0.17 close to the theoretical value 1/6. This result is also confirmed when using the other substrate (R = 4 cm).\nSoliton collision. \u2013 The nonlinear nature of the solitons is further confirmed by observing the collisions of two depression solitary waves as illustrated in fig. 8. Figure 8 (top right) shows an enlargement of the two solitary wave minima as they collide. The collision evidences a long residence time tr (of the order of 0.1 s) during collision, and a slight phase shift, a feature of solitons. We experimentally show in fig. (8) (bottom right) that tr scales\nas tr \u223c W\u0303 \u221a \u03b4Bo/A, matching our prediction (see Supp. Mat. [41]) and extending the pure gravity prediction [45].\nDirect scattering. \u2013 We have shown above that solitons observed along a liquid torus are well described by eqs. (2)-(4), the solutions of the periodic KdV eq. (1). We now implement a nonlinear spectral analysis, using the periodic inverse scattering transform (PIST), to find the discrete eigenvalue \u03bb of each soliton in our signals [32]. To the best of our knowledge, such a method has not been applied so far to an experimental periodic system with a significant discreteness in Fourier space. We associate with eq. (1) the following eigenvalue problem [32,37]\n\u03c8xx + [\u03b2\u03b7(x, t = t0) + \u03bb]\u03c8 = 0 , (5)\nsubjected to periodic boundary conditions, with period L = 2\u03c0Ro, and \u03b2 = 5/(12W\u0303\n3\u03c72\u03b4Bo). The eigenvalues correspond to either bounded solutions, i.e., solitons, for\np-5\n\u03bb < 0, and Stokes waves or radiative phonons for \u03bb \u2265 0 [31]. We use a periodic scattering matrix M(\u03bb) (called monodromy matrix) to translate the solutions of eq. (5) by one period. The nonlinear spectrum is then given by the condition Tr[M(\u03bb)]/2 = \u00b11. The experimental nonlinear spectrum is displayed in fig. 9 (bullets), along with the half-trace of the matrix M (solid line) for the signal in fig. 8 at a time t0. Two solitons are detected in fig. 9 for which Tr[M(\u03bb)]/2 = \u00b11 (four eigenvalues or two band gaps), corresponding to two distinct values \u03bb < 0. From this nonlinear spectrum, we compute the soliton index s, for each nonlinear mode, as [34]\ns = \u03bb2j+1 \u2212 \u03bb2j \u03bb2j+1 \u2212 \u03bb2j\u22121 , (6)\nwhich corresponds to solitons if s > 0.99, Stokes waves if 0.5 < s < 0.99, or linear radiative modes if s < 0.5 [46]. We are thus able to count the number of solitons included in a given signal, e.g., the one in fig. 8. Indeed, the inset of fig. 9 confirms the presence of two solitons, as expected. Beyond the validity of PIST to detect KdV solitons in a periodic system, PIST could be also be applied to directly generate a KdV soliton gas in such a geometry.\nConclusion. \u2013 We demonstrated the existence of solitons in a system with periodic and curved boundary conditions. They are observed propagating along a stable torus of fluid (created by a technique we developed) and are fully characterized (profile, velocity, collision, dissipation and nondispersive features). These unexplored solitons are found to be governed by a KdV equation with periodic boundary conditions leading to significant differences with infinite straight-line KdV solitons, such as the observation of subsonic elevation solitons, and the prediction of a nonlinear dependence of the soliton velocity on its amplitude. We show that the system periodicity (through the parameter m) selects the soliton velocity type (subsonic or supersonic), whereas the Bond number selects the soliton profile (depression or elevation). A nonlinear spectral analysis of solitons is also implemented (PIST) and is experimentally validated for the first time for a KdV equation with periodic conditions. Our work is not restricted to hydrodynamics, and thus could be applied to other domains involving periodic systems governed by a KdV equation. Quantifying the role of dissipation breaking integrability is also of primary interest [47]. In the future, this new system could address the possible existence of KdV soliton gas [17\u201321] in periodic systems, and their collision [48], as well as of Kaup-Boussinesq bidirectional solitons [20, 49\u201351] with corresponding finite-gap spectral methods [52].\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nWe thank A.
