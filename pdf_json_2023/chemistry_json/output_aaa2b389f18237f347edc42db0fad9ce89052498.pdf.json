    "abstractText": "A total of 610 reference samples were selected based on exclusion criteria; 53.2% being females. Mean gestational age (GA) of mothers at the time of delivery was 38.7\u00b11.6 weeks; 24.5% neonates were of low birth weight and 14.3% were preterm. Out of the total 610 neonates, 23.1% were small for GA. Reference intervals were generated for eleven amino acids, thirty-two acylcarnitines and succinylacetone concentrations. Markers were evaluated with respect to the influence of gender, GA, weight and time of sampling and statistically significant minimal differences were observed for some biomarkers.",

            "text": "Newborn screening (NBS) is a well-established public health program in most high-income countries to identify asymptomatic neonates with disorders for which prompt treatment by avoidance of fasting, special diets, cofactor and/or vitamin supplementation may decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality [1\u20133]. At present, newborns are being screened or diagnosed for more than thirty Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMDs) using tandem mass spectrometry in many developed countries with expanded newborn screening. Expanded newborn screening includes profiling of amino acids, acylcarnitines and succinylacetone for screening of a large group of IMDs including aminoacidopathies and organic acidemias [4\u20136]. In Pakistan, a national NBS program does not exist and dried blood spot (DBS) testing is still not the standard of care [7\u20139] but isolated efforts from private sector are being made. With a high incidence, approximately 46\u201362%, of consanguineous marriages in Pakistan it is presumed that there is a high incidence of IMDs [10\u201313]. A previous report from the Aga Khan University (AKU) Pakistan has shown prevalence rates of 4.7% from our center in 2016 in high-risk children [10]. Recent screening of about 22,500 high risk individuals has shown this to increase to 7.5% (unpublished data). One of the challenges in Pakistan is the non-availability of country specific reference interval (RI) for screening newborns for IMDs using DBS.\nRI is the interval between two limiting values within which 95% of the results for apparently\nhealthy individuals would fall usually between the 0.025 and 0.975 fractiles of the distribution of test results for the healthy or reference population [14]. Ascertaining RI in neonates and children is challenging due to heterogeneity of phenotypic and epidemiological variables such as gender, ethnicity, gestational age, weight and environmental conditions [15\u201318]. The RI and subsequently determined cutoffs may vary between NBS programs from one region to another [14]. It is therefore recommended and essential for screening laboratories to establish and verify population specific RI and cut-offs for each disease marker analyzed.\nThe objective of the current study was to determine RI for amino acids (eleven amino acids\nand seven ratios), acylcarnitines (thirty-two acylcarnitines and fourteen ratios) and succinylacetone on DBS from a cohort of neonates enrolled in the AMANHI (Alliance for Maternal and Newborn Health Improvement) bio repository study at AKU Pakistan. We also studied the effect of gestational age, gender, weight and time of sampling on RIs of these markers extracted from DBS. Under the circumstances in Pakistan, where groups are working to evolve NBS, establishing RI on DBS from neonates from birth to 4 days of age is timely and needed for describing clinical association with specific diseases and effective clinical interventions."

Briefly, the AMANHI biorepository study is a population-based pregnancy newborn cohort study, in three sites in South Asia and Africa [19]. The objective was to study the interactions between genes and biomarkers and a wide range of environmental exposures in causing diseases in pregnant women and newborns in low- and middle-income settings using uniform protocols and trained physicians [19]. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki Ethical Principles and Good Clinical Practices. The study received ethical approval from the Aga Khan University\u2019s Ethics Review Committee (Approval Number: 0591\u20133417) and World Health Organization\u2019s Ethics Review Committee (Approval number: RPC532).

Using harmonized protocols, approximately two thousand five hundred women in their early pregnancies (8\u201319 weeks) were enrolled and followed throughout gestation, until 42 days\u2019 post-partum. All pregnancies were confirmed using urine pregnancy test followed by confirmation with sonography to accurately determine the gestation age. Detailed phenotypic and epidemiological data from pregnant women and their families were collected by trained field workers at scheduled household visits during pregnancy (enrolment, 24\u201328 weeks, 32\u201336 weeks & 38+ weeks) and post-partum (0\u20136 and 42\u201360 days post-delivery) [20].\nDBS samples were obtained from heel prick (from the middle part of the heel) of babies of apparently healthy mothers within 6 days of birth. Blood was collected on Whatman 903 Protein Saver filter paper by trained phlebotomists, dried and stored in a biorepository following routine clinical care according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI C28-A3) guidelines [21]. A specially designed software was used for capturing data on biological samples which also guided the chronological flow of the sample collection process [20,22]. Babies born to mothers with metabolic diseases like gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, infections, and neonates who had any congenital anomaly were excluded from the study to avoid confounding effects. Neonates who had history of hospital admissions or did not survive on 60 days follow up were excluded from the study. Those neonates with incomplete datasets were also excluded."

Analysis was performed on Quattro Micro triple quadruple tandem mass spectrometers from Waters, Eschborn, Germany. An electrospray ionization source was used using previously established methodology [24,25]. Briefly, butyl esters of analytes were prepared from the extracts by derivatization. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was used to scan for specific mass ion intensities. Specific analytes concentrations were attained from the ratio of ion intensity at the mass and compared to its isotopically labeled internal standard and correcting for blood volume in a 1/8-inch DBS punch. Both internal and external spiked control specimens (from the Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program at the Centers for Disease Control), a normal control specimen from healthy children, and a blank was analyzed with each batch of specimens. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for each biochemical analyte was less than 20%.\nStatistical analysis and determination of reference interval\nThe NCSS, SPSS version 21 and Stata v-14 were used for statistical analysis. Tests for normality of analyte distributions (Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov, Shapiro-Wilk) were carried out using SPSS 21 (IBM). Descriptive statistics were used for characteristics of study participants and concentrations of amino acids, succinylacetone and acyl carnitines. Mean values and standard deviations (SD) were calculated for normally distributed variables. Percentages were used to describe dichotomous variables. Chi-squared tests were used for dichotomous variables with statistical significance \u03b1 set at 5%. Reference intervals were determined non-parametrically as most of the analytes were not normally distributed. The CLSI recommended method was used for the determination of upper and lower end points covering 95% of the reference values of each\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279931 January 6, 2023 3 / 15\nanalyte with respective 90% Confidence intervals (CI) [14]. Comparison of analyte distributions across categorical variables such as gender and GA were performed using the two sample independent samples t-test.\nAs per World Health Organization (WHO) neonates with weight less than 2500 gm (up to\nand including 2499 gm) were categorized as low birth weight (LBW) [26]. Babies were categorized into appropriate for gestational age (AGA) when weight was between 10th and 90th percentile in relation to gestational age, and into small for gestational age (SGA) when a baby\u2019s weight was less than the 10th percentile according to gender specific WHO growth chart for Asians [26]. Using WHO classification neonates were also classified according to gestational age (GA) as early term or premature, full term, and post term; if born before 37 weeks, between 38 to 42 weeks and beyond 42 weeks of pregnancy respectively. To further assess the effect of gender on the RI of markers the data was divided into 3 groups and RI compared also taking GA and neonatal weight into account. Group I included AGA neonates. Preterm and post term neonates were not excluded from this group. Group II included full term and SGA neonates. All preterm and post term neonates were excluded from this group. Group III had AGA and full-term neonates only. All preterm, post term and SGA neonates were excluded from Group III. As a measure of association, we used the F test comparing differences across AGA/ SGA, and preterm, term and post term newborns under the null hypothesis that all groups had the same mean response. RIs were calculated before and after adding SGA newborns and preterm babies (<37 weeks).\nThe authors agreed that the statistical significance indicates the reliability of the study\nresults while the clinical significance reflects its impact on clinical practice. Based on this the amino acids and acylcarnitine with statistically significant differences were individually analyzed by three subject experts. The subject experts based on their experiences and literature review noted their decision. This was followed by developing consensus in a meeting regarding the bias (p value) being clinically significant (even if any one expert disagreed) or insignificant (if all agreed)."

However, this difference was clinically insignificant as the 97.5th percentile was similar in males and females as shown in Table 2. As described for C5-DC, the 97.5th percentile for C5-DC was almost similar in males (0.08 \u03bcmol/L) and females (0.07 \u03bcmol/L).

Literature reports that SGA and preterm babies are prone to develop metabolic disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases in later life [27,28]. The study subjects were categorized in to three groups to evaluate the mean difference due to GA and term birth. Clinically significant effect of GA, weight, gender, and time of sampling on amino acid, succinylacetone and acylcarnitine blood spot concentrations were not identified in the current study. This was contrary to our expectations in comparison to findings from some previous studies [16\u201318]. Most amino acid concentrations including mean alanine levels in Pakistani newborns from this study were comparable with the published studies of liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on DBSs conducted in Thai newborns aged 0\u20134 days [29]. Wilson et al describe the effects of maturity on arginine, leucine, and valine that were at least 50% different between the cohorts of extremely premature and term children which was not seen in our study population [30]. However, in our study tyrosine levels in premature were higher (succinylacetone being normal) with a mean difference of 27.63 \u03bcmol/L. Elevated tyrosine with normal succinylacetone is primarily associated with transient tyrosinemia of the newborn which is common. Literature shows that up to 10% percent of newborns may have transient tyrosinemia, possibly due to vitamin C deficiency or immature hepatic enzymes which is benign and resolves without sequelae [31]. Reese et al studied the effect of GA and chronological age on 15 amino acids and 35\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279931.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279931 January 6, 2023 11 / 15\nacylcarnitines in 995 infants\u2019 blood taken within the first 24 hours after birth and on approximately days 7, 28, and 42 of life [32]. Out of the total, 21% of the neonates from this study had amino acids and acylcarnitines values above the pre-specified cutoffs used to identify infants with IMDs. None of the abnormal values could be explained by contamination of the blood sample, or by inappropriate collection methods [33].\nA Turkish group of researchers in a retrospective cohort study observed higher alanine lev-\nels in SGA neonates when compared with AGA neonates (p values< 0.05). Differing to the Turkish findings, in our study the DBS alanine levels were higher in AGA (247.71 \u00b1100.32 \u03bcmol/L) as compared to SGA newborns (232.16\u00b180.64 \u03bcmol/L); p value 0.04. Alanine is the key product of lactate metabolism and assists in glucose homeostasis, and higher levels of alanine in preterm neonates have been reported to increase the risk of diseases related to metabolic syndrome in later life [34]. We also noted higher mean alanine levels in full terms as compared to preterm with a mean difference of \u00b122 \u03bcmol/L. In the same Turkish study, methionine, isoleucine levels, C0, C2, C4, C5, C10:1, C18:1, C18:2, C14-OH, and C18:2-OH were higher and C3 and C6-DC levels were lower in SGA when compared with AGA newborns which was not seen in our sample population (p< 0.05) [33]. In another study conducted on full-term newborns (n = 6131) born in Iceland from 2009 to 2012 with newborn screening samples collected 72\u201396 hours after birth showed that both LBW (n = 36) and extremely macrosomic newborns (n = 37) show dissimilar metabolomic profiles compared to AGA neonates. For LBW the mean differences were higher than for AGA neonates in relation to C0, C8:1, C14:2, C18:2, while lower for C4OH. The greatest difference between LBW and AGA neonates was in levels of C0 (9 \u03bcmol/L). They also reported higher alanine in LBW babies contrary to our findings. However, the subjects in their study were only classified according to their weight without taking GA into account [35]. Dietzen DJ et al generated the 2.5th\u201397.5th percentile distributions of amino acids on DBS of newborns (n = 310) aged 0\u20134 days analyzed using LC-MS/MS, same instrument as ours [36]. The DBS specimens were obtained from a biobank stored at -80\u02daC. Comparing results from the current study and those reported by Dietzen DJ et al, RIs for alanine. leucine. phenylalanine and tyrosine, from our study population were slightly higher while arginine and glutamine were lower. No difference in RI of citrulline and methionine were obvious. However, a parallel comparison cannot be done as acylcarnitine and succinylacetone were not included and RIs were not determined taking gender, weight, and GA into account like our current study. Additionally, the differences in metabolites reference ranges between the previous studies and our work could be due to differences in methodology, equipment, reference sample, measurement conditions, or from dietary patterns which were not studied or compared. Further studies need to be conducted to determine the impact of pre-analytical variables like storage conditions, time between collection and freezing, impact of freeze-thaw cycles on amino acids, acylcarnitine and succinyl acetone levels.\nThe strengths of the study include sampling of early newborns from diverse ethnicities\nexisting in Pakistan. Moreover, DBS collection for the biorepository was done using standardized methods, with all DBS cards stored immediately at -80\u02daC and shipped for analysis within two months of collection under dry ice with temperature control to avoid transportation errors. We are confident of the quality of DBS cards as these samples were collected for the biorepository, transported, and processed under strict quality control measures and methods that have also been published [20]. A noticeable limitation of the study is the collective aggregate in each age group was inadequate to calculate age specific (0\u20134 days) RIs in neonates. This community derived RI may not be representative of all Pakistani babies as ours was a convenience sampling and subjects were predominantly from a single peri-urban community; however, all major ethnicities of Pakistan were represented. Besides being the only markers for\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279931 January 6, 2023 12 / 15\nidentifying aminoacidopathies in newborns, the amino acid levels, acylcarnitne in neonates is also a sign of their metabolic and nutritional status. The amino acids also reflect the nutritional (protein) intake of the mothers before and throughout pregnancy. It would be interesting to examine whether amino acid and acylcarnitine concentrations vary with maternal and neonatal nutritional status and intrauterine growth outcomes. The intrauterine environment can influence the metabolome during gestation, the results of which often manifest in the metabolic status of infants in later life."
