    "abstractText": "Solvent exchange is a controlled process for dilution-induced phase separation. This work utilizes the solvent exchange method to reveal the effect of the mixing dynamics on the asphaltene precipitation process under 20 different mixing conditions using a model system of n-heptane and asphaltene in toluene. The external mixing between the asphaltene solution and the paraffinic solvent is strictly controlled. We employed high-spatial resolution total internal reflection fluorescence microscope to detect asphaltene precipitates with a resolution up to \u223c 200 nm. A multiphysics model is used to simulate the evolution of oversaturation pulse in the solvent exchange process. Based on the simulation results, we predicted the effect of the flow rate, dimension, orientation of the microfluidic chamber, and temperature on the surface coverage and size distribution of asphaltene precipitates. The model predictions of all factors corroborate with the experimental observations. Local concentration of the solvent and shear forces are found to be the two main reasons for the change of asphaltene precipitation caused by mixing dynamics. However, the influence of thermodynamics is more critical than the mixing dynamics as temperature changes. Through a combination of experimental and simulation studies, this work illuminates the significance of the transportation process for the final morphology of asphaltene precipitates and provides a in-depth insight into the mechanism of mixing dynamics on the asphaltene precipitation. A smart mixing may be to boost new phase formation without excessive solvent consumption. 1 ar X iv :2 20 9. 00 08 8v 1 [ ph ys ic s. fl udy n] 3 1 A ug 2 02 2",

This work utilizes the solvent exchange method to reveal the effect of the mixing dynamics on the asphaltene precipitation process under 20 different mixing conditions using a model system of n-heptane and asphaltene in toluene. The external mixing between the asphaltene solution and the paraffinic solvent is strictly controlled. We employed high-spatial resolution total internal reflection fluorescence microscope to detect asphaltene precipitates with a resolution up to \u223c 200 nm. A multiphysics model is used to simulate the evolution of oversaturation pulse in the solvent exchange process. Based on the simulation results, we predicted the effect of the flow rate, dimension, orientation of the microfluidic chamber, and temperature on the surface coverage and size distribution of asphaltene precipitates. The model predictions of all factors corroborate with the experimental observations. Local concentration of the solvent and shear forces are found to be the two main reasons for the change of asphaltene precipitation caused by mixing dynamics. However, the influence of thermodynamics is more critical than the mixing dynamics as temperature changes. Through a combination of experimental and simulation studies, this work illuminates the significance of the transportation process for the final morphology of asphaltene precipitates and provides a in-depth insight into the mechanism of mixing dynamics on the asphaltene precipitation.

            "text": "Asphaltene plays an important role in energy sector through production, refinery, and transportant to value-added product from hydrocarbon-rich waste [1]. As a complex mixture containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, asphaltene is defined by solubility class that is soluble in aromatic solvents such as benzene and toluene and insoluble in n-alkanes solvents such as n-pentane and n-heptane [2]. On one hand, the presence of asphaltene hinders the coalescence of oil-water emulsions [3, 4], causing increase in operational cost and production challenges by forming flocculation and deposits in the reservoirs and transportation pipes. Undesirable asphaltene precipitation in the transportation pipes can cause severe problems such as clogging and blocking [5, 6]. On the other hand, dilution-induced asphaltene precipitation has been utilized in paraffinic froth treatment (PFT) units to remove impurities in bitumen such as water and solids. In this process, the particle size of asphaltene precipitates plays an important role, as they interact and agglomerate with water droplets and solid particles [7]. The precipitated asphaltene can be used as a raw material to make value-added products, such as absorbent, or carbon fibers [8\u201311]. Therefore, it is of importance to understand and control asphaltene precipitation.\nAsphaltene is considered to form nano-aggregates and nano-clusters in a crude oil or aromatic solvents, unless at high dilution [12\u201316]. Asphaltene dispersed in toluene is more stable due to the balance of attractions (van der Waals, H-bonding, and acid base interactions) and steric repulsions originated from side alkane chains [17, 18]. Adding n-alkanes such as paraffinic solvents into the mixture of asphaltene and toluene leads to\n\u2217Corresponding author \u2217\u2217Corresponding author\nEmail addresses: xiaolit@ualberta.ca (Xiaoli Tan), xuehua.zhang@ualberta.ca (Xuehua Zhang)\nPreprint submitted to Chemical Engineering Journal September 2, 2022\nthe collapse of the side alkane chain layer and a reduction in steric repulsion. Consequently, asphaltene nano-aggregates grow to a larger size and manifest as precipitates or aggregates [19, 20]. The effective parameters that may affect asphaltene precipitation include temperature [21], pressure [22], addition of inhibitors [23], solvent to bitumen (S/B) ratio [24, 25], and type of the solvent [26].\nRecently, the effect of mixing conditions on asphaltene precipitation has attracted the attention of researchers to understand aggregate formation [27\u201331]. In a conventional bulk system, when crude oil and paraffinic solvents were added into a container and mixed by a mixer, the resulting shear force caused by the agitation enhanced the growth rate of asphaltene particles, but the final size of the asphaltene particles was found to be smaller [27, 28]. The increase of the flow rate helped to increase the rate of deposition but the thickness of the final deposit layer was reduced [29\u201331].\nThe influence of mixing dynamics on asphaltene precipitation is mainly from two aspects. The impact of shear force on asphaltene aggregation and fragmentation [14, 32\u2013 34] and the variation in local compositions triggering asphaltene precipitation [35\u201338]. Extensive studies have been carried out to predict the deposition. However, there are knowledge gaps in the dynamics of dilution-induced asphaltene precipitation at the early stage. Importantly, the effects of local flow concentration and convection on asphaltene precipitation are challenging due to the poor mixing control. On the other side, the sampling procedures make it impossible to control convection. The results obtained from the direct visualization of asphaltene particles at a submicron scale may not be sufficient to investigate early-stage asphaltene precipitation due to the limited resolution of conventional optical microscopes. Microfluidic devices have been applied in the study of asphaltene precipitation with high reproducibility of results [39, 40]. For example, understanding the characteristics of the precipitates from mixing in confined spaces [41\u2013 43].\nSolvent exchange, also called solvent shifting or solvent displacement has shown promising results in a quantitative understanding of solvent-induced phase separation\n[44]. Controlled mixing by solvent exchange has led to fundamental insights into phase separation induced by dilution, including nanobubble and nanodroplet formation [45, 46], oiling out crystallization [47, 48], and polymer nanoprecipitation [49]. The approach of solvent exchange is displacing a solution in a good solvent with a poor solvent. Consequently, the new phase nucleates and grows at the mixing front due to a transient oversaturation [50]. The solvent exchange process is a well-controlled mixing system, which can be described by the advective diffusion equation [44]. Overall, the diffusive and convective mixing in the system is controllable by varying the dimension of the microfluidic chamber and the injection rate of the solvents. To the best of our knowledge, such fundamental studies on asphaltene precipitation are not yet reported in the open literature. In particular, the orientation and channel height of the chamber, the flow rate of the mixing, and the operating temperature can dictate the final morphology of asphaltene precipitates in terms of surface coverage (SC) and size distribution at the submicron and micron scales.\nThis research aims to understand the solvent-induced asphaltene precipitation under controlled convective mixing. The microfluidic flow rate, microchannel height, and orientation all enable the control of local concentration of the solvent and local shear force in the experiments. Systematic numerical investigations based on the finite element method (FEM) were performed to visualize the oversaturation pulse in the solvent exchange process for different geometric and flow conditions. Through the numerical results, we identified the generation of convective rolls when the channel height was more than a critical value due to gravity and buoyancy forces. Furthermore, the total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRF) and optical microscope are used to resolve the asphaltene particles at the submicron and micron scales. In this work, the surface coverage (SC) is characterized to quantify the asphaltene yield. The size distribution at the submicron and micron scales is specified to investigate the aggregation of asphaltene particles. The implication is that the optimized flow condition may mediate the asphaltene precipitation without leveraging solvents. The findings of this work provide new insights\ninto the influence of mixing condition on asphaltene precipitation, and is not only applicable to asphaltene precipitation but also has implications for other dilution-induced phase separation processes."

The asphaltene precipitation began at the moment when the concentration of n-heptane is higher than the onset point in the mixing front. At the moment, the solution A was completely displaced by solution B, asphaltene precipitation stopped due to lack of dissolved asphaltene. After injecting 2.5 mL of solution B (i.e., at least ten times the total volume of solution A), the asphaltene precipitation was considered the final state.

All the details of the fluid properties (i.e., density and viscosity) corresponding to experimental conditions are provided in the supporting information in Table S1. For different temperature conditions, toluene and n\u2013heptane properties were estimated using UNIFAC thermodynamic model with the software package Symmetry [55]. Influence of different microchannel geometries (i.e., height, see Table 2) and various flow rates (see Table 1) were examined . Unsteady state diffusion equation coupled with the velocity field was solved to obtain the evolution of the mixing front with space and time [56]. The velocity inlet boundary condition was applied to the microchannel inlet, and the pressure outlet boundary condition was used at the outlet as shown in Figure 2(a).\nNo-slip boundary condition was imposed at the top and bottom walls and inflow with zero concentration at the inlet. At t = 0, the oversaturation pulse in a narrow region (i.e., 100 \u00b5m thick) was initialized vertically along the inlet with a uniform concentration. The oversaturation pulse was convected and diffused simultaneously inside the microchannel, once the flow is initialized.

Simultaneously, asphaltene from solution A diffuses to solution B, and n-heptane diffuses towards solution A. As the diffusion process advances, The S/B ratio in the mixing zone gradually increases beyond the onset, until the concentration of asphaltene in the mixing front is oversaturated. At t = 0, the asphaltene in solution A is undersaturated. As time progresses, the asphaltene becomes oversaturated in the mixing region, which triggers the formation of asphaltene precipitate. Once the solution A is completely displaced by the solution B, the formation of asphaltene precipitate stops due to lack of asphaltene. The duration of the oversaturation pulse is independent of the flow velocity due to the no-slip boundary and depends on the diffusion of chemicals from the mixing front to the substrate [44]. Therefore, the new phase formation on the substrate is determined by the profile of the mixing front."

            "text": "Simulation results show the oversaturation pulse profile for different flow rates in Figure 3. The non-blue area is the mixing front, and the color scale bar indicates the corresponding concentration of oversaturation pulse in the system. At Pe of 458, the oversaturation pulse passes through the entire chamber in 16 s. At the highest Pe of 4,578, the duration of the pulse is approximately 2.7 s. Although the time for the precipitation is considerably shorter at larger Pe, the oversaturation levels near the bottom wall are similar through the entire process at all Pe, as exhibited by the consistent blue zone at the bottom in all snapshots. Therefore, diffusion of asphaltene and n-heptane towards the substrate at different Pe should be comparable because the concentration\ngradient is identical, resulting in a similar SC of asphaltene on the bottom wall. At any given moment, the level of the oversaturation on the top plate is substantially higher at lower Pe, which may lead to more precipitates on the top surface.\nFigure 4(a) shows the optical images of asphaltene precipitation in the solvent exchange with the flow rate of solution B ranging from 15mL/h to 150mL/h (i.e., Pe from 458 to 4,579). The black dots are asphaltene particles formed on the substrate placed on the bottom wall. It is worth mentioning that only the area with asphaltene particles is considered. The areas of asphaltene layers, as shown in Figure ??(b), are omitted when analyzing surface coverage (SC) and the size distribution of asphaltene particles because these large deposits may be agglomerates formed in the bulk. Figure 4(b) shows SC of the asphaltene particles divided by the total area, which is approximately independent\nof Pe and is always \u223c 14%.\nFigure 4(c) shows the size distribution of asphaltene particles. The distribution is plotted based on area density instead of the number density [58] to compare with the conventional study in a bulk system. Interestingly, the Gaussian distribution can fit the area density-based size distribution for each Pe. This Gaussian distribution is consistent with the presented results in a conventional mixing system [58]. The peaks of the size distribution in Figure 4(c) shift to the left with the increase of Pe, indicating the size of asphaltene particles decreases with the increase of Pe (Figure 4(d)).\nFigure 5(a) shows the TIRF images of asphaltene particles at different Pe. The white speckles are the asphaltene particles due to the natural fluorescence property of asphaltene under 488 nm laser excitation in air. Number density-based relative frequency is introduced to analyze the size distribution quantitatively. The relative frequency of\neach size bin is calculated by the number of particles of the corresponding size divided by the total number of particles. For primary submicron particles (PSMPs), which are defined as the radius from 200 to 400 nm [41], the relative frequency denotes the degree of aggregation at the early stage. A high relative frequency of PSMPs (Rp) represents the low possibility of PSMPs aggregating into larger particles after the precipitation. From the quantitative examination, as shown in Figure 5(b), it can be observed that Rp decreases with the increase of Pe. Rp is calculated by:\nRp = Npsmp\nNpsmp +Nsmp (6)\nwhere Npsmp and Nsmp are the quantity of primary submicron particles and quantity of submicron particles, respectively.\nInterestingly, the size of asphaltene particles correlates with the flow rate because of the mass transfer process of asphaltene from the oversaturation pulse to the substrate. The size of asphaltene particles decreases with Pe at micron-scale (Figure 4(c)) but increases at submicron scale (Figure 5(b)). The particle aggregation and fragmentation process are discussed to examine the reasons for the opposite trend of size distribution\nat submicron and micron scales. Based on the Smoluchowshi aggregation model, the aggregation is:\ndnk dt = 1 2 \u2211 i+j=k Ki,jninj \u2212 nk \u2211 i\u22651 Ki,kni (7)\nwhere ni, nj , and nk is the number density change of particle of size i, j, and k, respectively. t is time, and Ki,j is aggregation kernel, which is calculated by Ki,j = \u03b1i,j\u03b2i,j , where \u03b1i,j is the collision frequency and \u03b2i,j is the collision efficiency of particles. \u03b2i,j is:\n\u03b2i,j \u221d exp[\u2212 1\nkBT (\u03b4asp \u2212 \u03b4sol)2 ] (8)\nwhere kB is Boltzmann constant, \u03b4asp and \u03b4sol are Hildebrand solubility parameters of asphaltene and the paraffinic solvent, respectively. \u03b1i,j is driven by two factors in our system, including Brownian motion and shear force [27, 28, 59\u201361]:\n\u03b1i,j = 2\n3\nRT\n\u00b5\n(di + dj) 2\ndi.dj + G 6 (di + dj) 3 (9)\nwhere R is the ideal gas constant. T is temperature. \u00b5 is viscosity. di, and dj are the diameters of particles with sizes i and j, respectively, G is the shear rate.\nThe oversaturation level near the bottom wall is similar for all the Pe (Figure 3). Regardless, the velocity gradient between the maximum point of the flow and the minimum point adjacent to the substrate increases with Pe. The increased shear force leads to the increase of aggregation of PSMPs at an early stage (Equation (9)), ultimately resulting in lowering of Rp (Figure 5(b)).\nHowever, shear force brings an increase in the aggregation and the fragmentation of aggregates. The mechanism of fragmentation induced by shear rate is due to different pressures gradient on the opposite sides of the aggregates [62]. The fragmentation rate (Bi) increases with the particle volume (Vi) and the shear rate (Bi = kGyV 1/3 i ), where k is a proportionality fitting constant, y is a constant inversely proportional to the interac-\ntion strength between particles [27, 63\u201365]. Therefore, when the asphaltene particles are large enough (i.e., at the micron scale), the fragmentation yielded by shear force prevails, resulting in the decrease of particle size with the increase of shear rate (Figure 4(d)). It is worth noting that there is no maximum critical size for the asphaltene particles in the solvent exchange process because the chemical composition varies with time."

At the highest Ra of 39,873, the duration of the pulse is approximately 9.3 s. The increased duration of the oversaturation pulse provides a longer time for asphaltene precipitation and aggregation. Therefore, mass transfer of asphaltene from the oversaturation pulse to the substrate should increase with the increase of the Ra, resulting in a higher SC and larger size of asphaltene particles.\nFigure 7(a) shows the optical microscope images of asphaltene precipitates in channel heights from 90 \u00b5m to 510 \u00b5m under the same Pe. It is found that more asphaltene particles are formed with the increase of the channel height. Meanwhile, the size of\nasphaltene particles increases with the increase of the channel height. SC increases with Ra (Figure 7(b)). The relationship is almost linear. However, the linear relationship is not held when the channel height is 1,000 \u00b5m as shown in Figure ??(a). At 1,000 \u00b5m, many asphaltene deposits do not exist as particles but form a layer of sediments, as shown in Figure ??(b). Therefore, SC increases as the channel height increases and eventually reaches a maximum value. The formation of a larger SC and a layer of sediments of asphaltene are in line with the numerical findings. Figure 7(c) shows the size distribution of asphaltene particles as a function of Ra. The size distribution for each Ra can be fitted by Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian curve peaks increased from \u223c 0.2 to \u223c 0.9 with Ra increasing from 219 to 39,873. It indicates that the mean particle radius increases from 1.6 \u00b5m to 7.9 \u00b5m as shown in Figure 7(d). Particle size\nincreases with Ra because better solution mixing leads to an increase in particle collision efficiency \u03b2 in Equation (8), resulting in larger particles. These observations are also consistent with our numerical model predictions.\nOur simulations for the vertically placed devices also demonstrate that the duration of the oversaturation pulse increases with the increase of the channel height, as shown in Figure 8(d), which is consistent with the horizontally placed devices. Therefore, the SC increases with the channel height and the size distribution shifts to the right with the increase of channel height (Figure 8(a)-(c)).\nTIRF images of the final state of asphaltene particles are captured to show the details of asphaltene particles at the submicron scale, and is shown in Figure 9(a). It can be seen from Figure 9(b) that Rp decreases from \u223c 65% to \u223c 52% with the increase of\nRa from 219 to 39,873, reflecting the aggregation of particles is more intensified in the channel with a more significant height. Correspondingly, the proportion of large particles, especially those larger than 0.8 \u00b5m, increases with the increase of the channel height. This observation at the submicron scale is consistent with that at the micron scale."

            "text": "In the device with the same channel height, the oversaturation pulse takes the same time to pass through the channel in both horizontal and vertical devices. However, the mixing dynamics are different. When the channel height is 510 \u00b5m (Ra is 39,873 for the horizontally placed device), simulation results showed the formation of convective rolls (Figure 6(d)) in the horizontally placed device, leading to better mixing between solutions A and B. The final maximum oversaturation level for the horizontally placed device is approximately 0.02, while the one for the vertically placed device is approximately 0.01. In addition, the oversaturation area is not in the middle but shifts downwards and thus closer to the bottom wall because the asphaltene is heavier compared with n-heptane and toluene, an asphaltene-rich domain forms at the tail of the profile of the oversaturation pulse (Figure 6(c)). However, the asphaltene-rich domain does not appear\nin the vertically placed cases. The loss of convective rolls and asphaltene-rich domain in the vertically placed devices results in reduced mass transfer compared to horizontally placed devices. Therefore, diffusion of asphaltene and n-heptane towards the substrate of the vertically placed device should be smaller than the horizontally placed device, resulting in the decrease of SC and left-shift of the particle size distribution.\nFigure ??(a) shows the comparison of optical images of asphaltene precipitates between horizontally and vertically placed devices. The horizontally placed device has a higher SC of asphaltene particles than the vertically placed device, especially for 510 \u00b5m (Figure ??(b)). SC increases from \u223c 12% to \u223c 18%, revealing more asphaltene deposits on the substrate, which is in line with the numerical results.\nThe numerical results of varying P\u00e9clet number displays stack-like extreme convective rolls and very large asphaltene-rich region (Figure ??). Video S1 (see supplementary information) shows a backflow after the mixing front reaches the outlet. Therefore, the SC may increase sharply when the channel height is 1,000 \u00b5m. The formation of the layer of sediments in the 1,000 \u00b5m channel height group is consistent with our numerical results in Figure ??(b). Due to the intense mixing of the model oil and solvents, the asphaltene precipitation at 1,000 \u00b5m may be closer to that in the bulk phase mixing system in the conventional study [66].\nOrientation direction can also affect the size distribution of the asphaltene particles deposited on the substrate. Figure ??(d)-(f) reveals the rightwards shift of particle size in the horizontally placed device, meaning the asphaltene particles are relatively large in horizontally placed devices compared with the vertically placed ones. However, the shift of size distribution is not observed in the 90 \u00b5m microchamber (Figure ??(c)). This is due to Ra is smaller than the critical value (1,708) when the channel height is 90 \u00b5m [44]. The convective rolls and asphaltene-rich domain are not observed in the horizontally placed device.\nIn the solvent exchange process, particles may form on the substrate and in the bulk of the liquid simultaneously. The particles formed in the bulk may settle down onto\nthe substrate under gravity in the horizontally placed device. This is mainly due to the competition between gravity and Brownian motion. Brownian motion of the particles (XBrownian) is [67]:\nX 2 Brownian = 4RTKmt\n3\u03c02\u00b5Nd (10)\nwhere R is the ideal gas constant, T is temperature, Km is the correction for discontinuity of fluid, which is 1 for liquid. t is time, which is calculated by dividing the volume of the microchamber by the flow rate, \u00b5 is the viscosity of the solvent, N is Avogadro constant, d is the diameter of particles. The Stokes settling motion of a particle is [67]:\nXSettling = (\u03c1asp \u2212 \u03c1sol)gd2t\n18\u00b5 (11)\nwhere \u03c1asp is the density of asphaltene and \u03c1sol is the density of the solvent. For each channel height, only the particles with a diameter larger than 8 \u00b5m (logarithmic radius is 0.6) can settle under gravity. However, the rightwards shift is observed of particles smaller than 8 \u00b5m as shown in Figure ??(d). In addition, particles larger than 8 \u00b5m in Figure ??(c) of 90 \u00b5m device do not show a rightwards shift. Therefore, gravityinduced settlement is not the reason for the rightwards shift in horizontally placed devices. The increase of particle size is also due to the enhancement of solution mixing in the horizontally placed device."

            "text": "The density difference between solutions A and B does not change significantly with the change in temperature (Table ??). The duration for the oversaturation pulse to completely pass the entire channel is approximately 4 s for all the examined temperatures. Figure 10 shows the profile of the oversaturation pulse near the bottom wall does not change much with the increase in temperature, as indicated by the consistent blue zone. In addition, from the experiments performed in the 1,000 \u00b5m microchamber, it was evident that there was sufficient mixing in all of the temperatures due to the presence\nof convective rolls, as shown in Figure ??. Therefore, mixing at all the temperatures we studied should be adequate.\nFigure 11(a) shows the optical images of asphaltene particles at different temperatures. SC from 20 \u25e6C to 58 \u25e6C are similar but SC of 65 \u25e6C is much smaller than the other groups. The size distribution shows a rightwards shift trend with the increase of temperature from 20 to 58 \u25e6C. But the size distribution shifts to left from 58 to 65 \u25e6C (Figure 11(b)-(d)). The experiment results are mainly due to the thermodynamics influence. Asphaltene is a mixture of different fractions, and the increase in temperature resulted in some asphaltene fractions becoming soluble in asphaltene [68]. The reason may be the increase of steric repulsion between asphaltene particles caused by the increase in temperature [19, 20]. These asphaltene fractions do not precipitate, resulting in a decrease of SC at 65 \u25e6C. This observation is consistent with the previous study in a conventional bulk system [66].\nFigure 12(a) shows the TIRF images of asphaltene particles. The quantitative size distribution at the submicron scale is shown in Figure 12(b). In summary, PSMPs are less likely to aggregate into fractal particles with increasing temperature.\nEquations (8) and (9) show both the collision frequency and efficiency increase with temperature. Therefore, the overall right-shift trend from 20 \u25e6C to 58 \u25e6C in micron\nscale is expected in Figure 11(c) and (d). The leftwards shift from 58 \u25e6C to 65 \u25e6C is caused by asphaltene dissolution in n-heptane at 65 \u25e6C, as we discussed in the previous section. However, it is surprising that Rp increases apparently from \u223c 48% to \u223c 58% with the increase of temperature at the submicron scale (Figure 12(b)). In this regard, it is to be noted that asphaltene is a mixture of several fractions. The responses of various fractions to temperature are different [69]. The increase in temperature causes some fractions of asphaltene become more soluble in n-heptane. The Hildebrand solubility parameter difference in Equation (8) is lower. The repulsive interaction between this \u2019soluble-like\u2019 fraction of asphaltene particles is high when they form PSMPs, causing a decrease in collision efficiency for further aggregation. In addition, a decrease in SC also leads to less possibility of PSMPs aggregation [43]. As a result, the PSMPs formed\nby these \u2018soluble-like\u2019 asphaltene do not form aggregates but exist as PSMPs on the substrate to cause a higher Rp."

            "text": "Dilution-induced asphaltene precipitation was experimentally investigated using a solvent exchange method in a microchamber. The size distribution of asphaltene precipitates in high resolution images was analyzed and compared after 20 different mixing conditions with a paraffinic solvent, including flow rate, chamber height and orientation, and the solvent temperature. In the same microfluidic chamber, increasing the flow rate of paraffinic solvents accelerated the aggregation rate but caused the particle growth to stop at smaller levels. However, the flow rate had no obvious effect on the surface coverage of asphaltene precipitates. The surface coverage and size of asphaltene precipitates increased with the chamber height, regardless of the orientation of the chamber. But both the surface coverage and size of asphaltene particles of the horizontally placed device were larger than the vertically placed device when the channel height was higher than 180 \u00b5m. The difference between a horizontally and a vertically chamber was attributed the for-\nmation of convective rolls caused by gravity, which vanished in a narrow chamber (90 \u00b5m in height). Moreover, our results showed that higher temperatures resulted in lower SC and larger particle sizes from 20 to 65 \u25e6C, possibly due to more stable asphaltene in the mixture liquid at higher temperature. For all mixing conditions, the oversaturation pulse resulted from the solvent exchange process were simulated using a finite element method based multiphysics solver. Our model results corroborated well with the experimental results. The combination of the experimental and simulation results demonstrated the significance of mixing dynamics on the morphology of the asphaltene precipitates.\nThe important implication from this study is that mixing conditions, such as flow rate, temperature, orientation, and dimension of microchamber, may be potentially leveraged as a cost-saving and effective approach to controlled asphaltene precipitation without using additional paraffinic solvents. Our work covers a wide range of mixing conditions to be relevant to many situations. Furthermore, this implication is not only applicable to asphaltene precipitation, but to other dilution-induced phase separation processes, such as nanoparticle aggregation or polymer precipitation.\nDeclaration of Competing Interests\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal\nrelationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."
