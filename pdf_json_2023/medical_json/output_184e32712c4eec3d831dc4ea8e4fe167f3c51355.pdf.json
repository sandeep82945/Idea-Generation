    "abstractText": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a substantial threat to pig populations worldwide, contributing to economic disruption and food security challenges. Its spread is attributed to the oronasal transmission route, particularly in animals with acute ASF. Our study addresses the understudied role of nasal mucosa in ASFV infection, using a nasal explant model. The explants remained viable and revealed a discernible ASFV infection in nasal septum and turbinates postinoculation. Interestingly, more infected cells were found in the turbinates despite its thinner structure. Further analyses showed (i) a higher replication of genotype II strain BEL18 than genotype I strain E70 in the epithelial cell layer, (ii) a preference of ASFV infection for the lamina propria and a tropism of ASFV for various susceptible cell types in different areas in the nasal mucosa, including epithelial cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Using porcine respiratory epithelial cells (PoRECs), isolated from nasal tissue, we found a difference in infection mechanism between the two genotypes, with genotype I favoring the basolateral surface and genotype II preferring the apical surface. Moreover, disruption of intercellular junctions enhanced infection for genotype I. This study demonstrated that ASFV may use the respiratory mucosa for entry using different cell types for replication with a genotype difference in their infection of respiratory epithelial cells.",

            "text": "African swine fever (ASF) is a highly infectious disease that impacts both domestic pigs and wild boars, with a potential lethality rate up to 100% [1]. The etiological agent, ASF virus (ASFV) is a large double-stranded DNA virus and the only member of the family Asfarviridae [2]. ASFV is classified into 24 genotypes based on sequencing of the variable region of the B646L gene, which encodes the major capsid protein, p72 [3]. Since the disease was described in 1920s, all identified genotypes persist in Africa. The first detection of ASFV outside Africa happened in 1957, when genotype I was reported in Lisbon, Portugal. This marked the beginning of its spread to neighboring countries in Europe and Latin America Handling editor: Marie Galloux. \u2020Maryl\u00e8ne Tignon and Hans J. Nauwynck\u2014Shared seniorship. *Correspondence: Dayoung Oh dayoung.oh@ugent.be 1 Laboratory of Virology, Department of Translational Physiology, Infectiology and Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Merelbeke, Belgium 2 Department Infectious Diseases in animals, Service of Viral Reemerging Enzootic and Bee Diseases, Sciensano, Groeselenberg 99, Brussels, Belgium\n[4, 5]. A second escape of ASFV from Africa took place in 2007 when genotype II was reported in Georgia [6]. This genotype exhibits a high degree of virulence and is currently driving a widespread pandemic in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean islands (source: WOAH report, March 17\u201330, 2023) [7]. Since there is no vaccine registered for ASFV, except in Vietnam [8], knowledge and countermeasures against the disease have become top veterinary priorities, considering the disease\u2019s economic impact, its threat to pork product supplies, and issues with animal welfare.\nASFV can be transmitted through various routes, including oronasal ingestion, aerosol exposure, iatrogenic, via semen, and through soft ticks (biological reservoir) [9, 10]. Affected pigs release the virus into their surroundings via secretions and excretions, including oral and nasal fluids, blood, feces, and urine. These contain a high concentration of virus during the disease\u2019s acute phase. Direct nose-to-nose contact or inhalation of viruses present in aerosols can increase the risk of viral transmission. It has been shown that intranasally inoculated pigs develop acute disease and virus can be detected in nasal swabs of the air-contact pigs [11]. This suggests that infectious ASFV particles are present in the nasal mucosa. However, ASFV pathogenesis in the nasal mucosa remains unknown.\nThe nasal mucosa is the first tissue that allows pathogens entering the respiratory system. The outermost layer is the pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium, whose integrity and polarity are meticulously maintained by intercellular junctions (ICJ) [12]. Beneath lies the lamina propria, a loose connective tissue layer populated with glands and immune cells [13, 14]. The submucosa, similar but denser than the lamina propria, resides at a deeper level [15]. Epithelial cells in the nasal airway are often first targets for viruses, followed by immune cells in the epithelium and lamina propria [16]. These infected immune cells allow viruses penetrating the epithelial barrier, navigating through the lamina propria, and eventually entering the bloodstream [17, 18].\nIn this study, we employed a respiratory mucosal explant model that mimics in\u00a0vivo conditions to explore the infection patterns of ASFV in the nasal mucosa, using genotype I strain E70 and genotype II strain Belgium 2018/1 (BEL18). Additionally, we isolated and cultivated primary porcine respiratory epithelial cells (PoRECs) on transwells to examine the polarity of ASFV binding and subsequent viral replication."

After intravenous euthanasia with pentobarbital (Kela, Hoogstraten, Belgium) at 12.5 mg/kg body weight, nasal septum and turbinates were collected. Isolation and culture of nasal explants were adapted from the previously described method [19]. Briefly, nasal septum and turbinate were collected by carefully stripping off from the bone. Mucus was washed on ice-cold transport medium containing HBSS with calcium and magnesium (Gibco, Paisley, UK), 0.1\u00a0mg/mL gentamicin (Gibco, Paisley, UK), 0.1\u00a0mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 100\u00a0 U/mL penicillin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), and 5\u00a0 \u03bcg/mL amphotericin B (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). Tissues were then cut in small square pieces (25\u00a0 mm2) and immediately placed epithelial side facing up on a find-meshed grid in a 6-well plate containing serum-free medium containing DMEM/RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Paisley, UK) (1:1 ratio), 0.1\u00a0 mg/mL gentamicin, 0.1\u00a0 mg/mL streptomycin, 100\u00a0 U/mL penicillin. The explants were cultivated at an air\u2013liquid interface for 24 h (37\u00a0\u00b0C, 5% CO2).\nIsolation and culture of PoRECs were adapted from the previously described method for the isolation of equine respiratory epithelial cells (ERECs) [20]. Nasal septum and turbinate tissues were pooled and incubated with an enzyme mix of 1.12\u00a0 mg/mL pronase (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and 80\u00a0 \u03bcg/ mL DNase I (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) in calcium- and magnesium-free PBS supplemented with 25\u00a0 mM glucose (VWR international, Leuven, Belgium), 1% sodium pyruvate (Gibco, Paisley, UK), 0.1\u00a0mg/ mL streptomycin, 100\u00a0 U/mL penicillin, and 5\u00a0 \u03bcg/mL amphotericin B for 24\u00a0 h at 4\u00a0 \u00b0C. Detached cells were then incubated in DMEM/F12 (1:1 ratio) containing 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA) (Gibco, Paisley, UK), 0.12% Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-Ethanolamine (ITSX) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 0.1\u00a0mg/mL streptomycin, 100\u00a0U/mL penicillin, and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL amphotericin B in a cell-culture petri dish for 4\u00a0h to reduce fibroblast contamination by adherence. Isolated PoRECs were analyzed by trypan blue staining and seeded at a density of 0.8 million cells per transwell-insert in a 12-well plate and cultivated overnight in Afi1 medium which contains DMEM/F12 (1:1 ratio), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1% NEAA, 0.1\u00a0mg/ mL streptomycin, 100\u00a0 U/mL penicillin, and 5\u00a0 \u03bcg/mL amphotericin B. Transwell inserts with 1.0\u00a0\u03bcm pore size (Falcon) were used and pre-coated with type IV collagen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were then washed with DMEM/F12 medium and replaced by Afi2 medium which contains 2% Ultroser G (Sartorius, Cergy, France) instead of FBS in the Afi1 medium. The medium\nwas added to the bottom well to have an air\u2013liquid interface and the cells were cultivated for 5\u20137 days."

Most of infected cells were found in clusters especially in the epithelium and the lamina propria (Figure\u00a02A). In addition, many infected cells were identified as CD163-negative, especially in the epithelium (Figure\u00a02A). The total number of infected cells increased over incubation time in both nasal tissues inoculated by each strain (Figure\u00a02B). There was no significant difference between E70 and BEL18. More infected cells were found in the turbinate explant at 72 hpi (E70: 20.33 \u00b1 3.07 cells/mm2; BEL18: 22.80 \u00b1 1.45 cells/mm2) than in the septum explant (E70: 6.38 \u00b1 0.64 cells/mm2; BEL18: 7.42 \u00b1 0.59 cells/mm2). To study the pattern of infection in different areas of the nasal mucosa, infected cells were quantified and the proportion of infected cells in each area was calculated as percentage (Figure\u00a02C). Infected cells were mainly found in the lamina propria in both septum (E70: 77.08 \u00b1 7.67%; BEL18: 65.48 \u00b1 5.53%) and turbinates (E70: 71.48 \u00b1 3.51%; BEL18: 56.35 \u00b1 4.21%). In both septum and turbinates, infection of E70 was similar between the epithelium (septum: 11.29 \u00b1 3.62%; turbinates: 14.11 \u00b1 4.57%) and the submucosa (septum: 11.98 \u00b1 6.61%; turbinates: 14.42 \u00b1 4.34%). On the other hand, BEL18 showed higher infection in the epithelium (septum: 21.47 \u00b1 5.37%; turbinates: 25.27 \u00b1 7.53%) than in the submucosa (septum: 13.05 \u00b1 0.97%; turbinates: 18.38 \u00b1 4.41%).\nVarious types of\u00a0cells in\u00a0the\u00a0nasal mucosa are susceptible to\u00a0ASFV Since we detected both CD163-positive and CD163negative ASFV-positive cells in different regions of the nasal mucosa, further characterization was necessary using the following cell type markers: CD163 and CD14 (marker for monocyte/macrophage), SWC3 (marker for myeloid cell), Sn (marker for macrophage), CD1c\n(marker for antigen presenting cell), cytokeratin (marker for epithelial cell), vimentin (marker for fibroblast/mesenchymal cell), MHCII (marker for antigen presenting cell), and von Willebrand factor (marker for endothelial cell) (Additional file\u00a0 1). We first validated the reactivity of the selected markers by performing IF staining on the lungs and nasal tissue sections. The lung section showed positivity to all the selected cell markers, except for the endothelial cell marker, von Willebrand factor (vWF) (Additional files 1 and 2). On the other hand, SWC3 and CD1c were negative in the nasal tissue sections. Thus, these markers were excluded from the further characterization of ASFV infected cells. To characterize the phenotype of ASFV infected cells in the nasal explant, we performed double IF stainings against ASFV and the selected cell markers and calculated the proportion of cell marker-positive cells among the infected cells in the epithelium, lamina propria, and submucosa (Figure\u00a0 3A).

Each group is labeled as septum-E70, septum-BEL18, turbinate-E70, and turbinate-BEL18. In our analysis of both genotypes and types of nasal explants, we observed that a significant fraction of the virus-infected cells within the epithelium were cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells (septum-E70: 93.33 \u00b1 11.55%, septum-BEL18: 85.56 \u00b1 17.11%, turbinate-E70: 96.30 \u00b1 6.42%, turbinateBEL18: 98.15 \u00b1 3.21%) (Figure\u00a0 3B and Additional file\u00a0 3). Additional subsets of infected cells within the epithelium displayed positivity for CD163 (septum-E70: 8.33 \u00b1 14.43%, septum-BEL18: 6.48 \u00b1 5.78%, turbinateE70: 12.54 \u00b1 11.38%, turbinate-BEL18: 13.40 \u00b1 12.99%), Sn (only identified in the septum-BEL18: 13.33 \u00b1 23.09%), vimentin (septum-E70: 18.89 \u00b1 20.09%, septum-BEL18: 22.22 \u00b1 19.25%, turbinate-E70: 10.44 \u00b1 11.17%, turbinateBEL18: 30.42 \u00b1 3.41%), and MHCII (only identified in the septum-E70: 4.76 \u00b1 8.25%). Despite their presence, these subsets constituted a minor proportion of the total number of infected cells and exhibited a variability across individual animals (Figure\u00a0 3B and Additional file\u00a0 3). Infected cells within the epithelium expressing CD14 and vWF were absent.\nFocusing on the lamina propria, a considerable proportion of the infected cells were found to be vimentinpositive (septum-E70: 93.50 \u00b1 11.27%, septum-BEL18: 100%, turbinate-E70: 93.88 \u00b1 10.60%, turbinate-BEL18: 90.00 \u00b1 17.32%) (Figure\u00a03B and Additional file\u00a03). Except for the E70-inoculated nasal septum, a statistically larger proportion of infected cells in the lamina propria was found to be positive for vimentin, CD163, and vWF, compared to those in the epithelium and submucosa (Figure\u00a03B and Additional file\u00a03). Notably, ASFV+vWF+ cells were exclusively identified within the lamina propria (septum-E70: 37.05 \u00b1 5.20%, septum-BEL18: 43.54 \u00b1 4.00%, turbinate-E70: 28.34 \u00b1 13.63%, turbinateBEL18: 35.41 \u00b1 6.96%) (Figure\u00a03B and Additional file\u00a03).\nIn the submucosa, a significant proportion of the infected cells were found to be positive for vimentin (septum-E70: 100%, septum-BEL18: 85.71 \u00b1 14.29%, turbinate-E70: 94.87 \u00b1 8.88%, turbinate-BEL18: 82.96 \u00b1 5.13%) and CD163 (septum-E70: 77.78 \u00b1 19.25%, septum-BEL18: 79.50 \u00b1 5.56%, turbinate-E70: 75.40 \u00b1 29.39%, turbinateBEL18: 73.59 \u00b1 23.10%) (Figure\u00a03B and Additional file\u00a03). This region in the turbinates primarily exhibited infected cells positive for CD14 (turbinate-E70: 96.30 \u00b1 6.42% and turbinate-BEL18: 90.24 \u00b1 9.17%), followed by Sn\n(turbinate-E70: 57.78 \u00b1 36.72% and turbinate-BEL18: 31.19 \u00b1 7.84%). The septum displayed a marked decrease in their prevalence (CD14: Septum-E70: 41.67 \u00b1 52.045, septum-BEL18: 18.10 \u00b1 31.34%; Sn: Septum-E70: 19.44 \u00b1 17.35%, septum-BEL18: 28.14 \u00b1 0.75%). Infected cells within the submucosa were not positive for MHCII, cytokeratin or vWF (Figure\u00a03B and Additional file\u00a03).\nASFV genotype I strain E70 mainly targets the\u00a0basolateral side, while\u00a0genotype II strain BEL18 mainly targets apical surfaces of\u00a0respiratory epithelial cells Given our observation of ASFV primarily targeting cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells in the nasal epithelium, we further investigated the infection patterns of the two ASFV strains in porcine respiratory epithelial cells (PoRECs), employing both apical and basolateral sideinoculation strategies. To determine whether intercellular junction (ICJ) influences ASFV infection, cells were treated with 25 mM EGTA before inoculation at the apical surface.\nSurprisingly, the two ASFV strains showed a different tropism of infection. For E70, the number of infected cells was significantly higher after inoculation at the basolateral surfaces (72 hpi: 331.48 \u00b1 15.61 cells/cm2), than after apical inoculation (72 hpi: 2.22 \u00b1 2.22 cells/ cm2) (Figure\u00a04A). The number of infected cells via basolateral inoculation significantly increased over incubation time (Figure\u00a0 4A). Disruption of ICJ clearly influenced infection at 24 hpi (230.37 \u00b1 21.27\u00a0 cells/cm2). However, subsequent incubation resulted in a progressive decrease in infection (48\u00a0hpi: 113.70 \u00b1 29.66 cells/cm2 and 72\u00a0hpi: 84.81 \u00b1 24.48\u00a0 cells/cm2) (Figure\u00a0 4A). In contrast to E70, the number of BEL18-infected cells was significantly higher after inoculation at the apical surfaces (72\u00a0 hpi: 76.30 \u00b1 7.14\u00a0cells/cm2), compared to basolateral inoculation (1.85 \u00b1 3.21\u00a0 cells/cm2) (Figure\u00a0 4A). BEL18 infection peaked at 24\u00a0 hpi (140.00 \u00b1 13.52\u00a0 cells/cm2) and significantly decreased at 48\u00a0 hpi (58.15 \u00b1 1.28\u00a0 cells/cm2) and slightly increased at 72\u00a0hpi (76.30 \u00b1 7.14\u00a0cells/cm2, statistically not significant) (Figure\u00a04A). Disruption of ICJ did not significantly increase the number of infected cells in apically inoculated PoRECs (Figure\u00a04A).IF staining of PoRECs revealed different features of infected cells by E70 and BEL18 strains. Following basolateral inoculation, E70-infected cells were found in close proximity of each other (plaque-wise appearance), whereas BEL18-infected cells, upon apical inoculation, appeared to be dispersed individually (Figure\u00a04B).

            "text": "ASFV continues to pose a severe threat to global pig populations, causing substantial economic damage, disrupting food security, and giving issues with animal welfare. Among the several ASFV transmission routes, the oronasal route is a significant factor in understanding the viral spread, especially in animals with acute ASF [11]. The nasal mucosa, as an entry point for initial infection, as well as a reservoir of the virus, is a highly favorable pathway for transmission of several porcine respiratory viruses, such as swine influenza virus (SIV) and PRRSV [23, 24]. Experimental and field studies suggested the potential involvement of the upper respiratory system in the transmission of ASFV [11, 25, 26], however, ASFV infection in the nasal mucosa was not studied yet. In this study, we employed a well-established porcine nasal explant model [19], designed to mimic the highly multifaceted respiratory environment. We isolated two types of nasal tissue: the nasal septum and the nasal turbinates. These tissues were subsequently cultivated at the air\u2013liquid interface and inoculated with genotype I strain E70 and genotype II strain BEL18.\nWe first analyzed the viability of nasal mucosa explants during in\u00a0 vitro cultivation. Our findings demonstrated that cells in the epithelium (EP) and the lamina propria (LP) maintained high levels of viability after 72 h of incubation. We observed an increase in the number of apoptotic cells within the submucosa (SM). However, these cells were mainly restricted at the edge of the tissue, suggesting the potential damage during the cutting of the explant. Grossly, the nasal explants appeared to be viable without substantial morphological change.\nOur results, obtained via immunofluorescence staining for the major ASFV capsid protein p72 and monocyte/macrophage marker CD163, uncovered key aspects of ASFV infection within the nasal explant. Intriguingly, infections by both genotypes (genotype I strain E70 and genotype II strain BEL18) were discerned within the nasal septum and turbinates. Over the incubation period after inoculation, we noted a rise in the total number of infected cells in both nasal tissues for both strains. Although the difference between E70 and BEL18 strains was not significant, we observed a higher number of infected cells in the turbinate explant compared to the septum explant. We additionally measured the thickness\nof the septum and turbinate explants, and surprisingly, the septum was significantly thicker than the turbinate, which appeared to be due to the thicker submucosal layer (Additional file\u00a05). Despite this, our results showed that more infected cells were found in the turbinates, suggesting that the turbinate tissue exhibits a better susceptibility to ASFV. When comparing the two ASF genotypes, it became clear that, in the epithelial cell layer, two times more cells were infected with genotype II compared to genotype I.\nOur comprehensive investigation into the distribution of ASFV infection across different areas in the nasal mucosa revealed insightful results. Analysis of the infected cells in three distinct regions (epithelial cell layer, lamina propria, and submucosa), revealed that the lamina propria is a preferential site for ASFV replication, irrespective of the viral strain. The infected cells were found in clusters, predominantly in the EP and LP implying a spread in a cell-associated way. Although it is generally accepted that the main target cells of ASFV are monocytes and macrophages [27], a significant number of CD163-negative infected cells were found across the different regions of the nasal mucosa. Further phenotypic characterization of these infected cells revealed that different types of cells in the nasal mucosa are susceptible to ASFV. A significant fraction of virus-infected cells within the epithelial cell layer was found to be cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells. In the LP, we found that many infected cells were positive for vimentin, CD163, MHCII, and vWF, indicating that the major target cells in this tissue\u00a0area are macrophage-like and endothelial cells. In the submucosa, vimentin and CD163-positive infected cells were found, pointing in the direction of macrophages as targets. The prevalence of CD14 and Sn positive cells in the population of infected cells varied depending on the specific nasal region, virus strain, and individual animals. ASFV primarily targets macrophages and monocytes. The scavenger receptor, CD163 is expressed in cells of the monocytic lineage and its role as an ASFV receptor has been proposed [28]. However, recent findings suggest that it may not be an essential factor, given that CD163 knockout pigs can still be infected by the virus [29]. In addition, many studies demonstrated that ASFV can also infect other cell types such as dendritic cells, hepatocytes, renal tubular epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and some established cell lines with less efficiency [30\u201335]. Our finding of infected cells with various phenotypes in the nasal mucosa is in agreement with these findings, highlighting the versatile cellular tropism of ASFV. While\nour study highlighted the wide cell tropism of ASFV, it remains essential for future studies to determine if these cell types can produce infectious virus.\nBuilding further upon our findings, which revealed a significant proportion of cytokeratin-positive infected cells in the epithelium, we expanded our investigation by inoculating two ASFV strains in the respiratory epithelial cells isolated from the nasal tissue (PoRECs). Intercellular junctions (ICJ) play a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity and polarity of the ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium by providing a distinct barrier between the apical and basolateral domains of the cell. Certain viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis A virus, and simian virus 40, display a preference for infecting via the apical surface of the cells [36\u201338], while other viruses, such as adenoviruses, demonstrate a tropism for the basolateral side of the cells [39]. Our findings suggest a genotypic variation in the mechanism of ASFV infection, especially in their preference for apical or basolateral surfaces of PoRECs. ASFV genotype I, E70, was found to primarily target the basolateral surface of the epithelial cells. Interestingly, the disruption of ICJ with EGTA influenced the infection rates at the early stages (24\u00a0 hpi), however, subsequent incubation resulted in a progressive decrease in infection. The difference between these two situations (basolateral versus EGTA/apical inoculation), may be related to the repair of the ICJ upon culturing the cells. In contrast, the genotype II, BEL18 infection, showed a preference for the apical surface. The number of infected cells peaked at 24 h after apical inoculation but decreased in further incubation period. Moreover, disruption of ICJ did not significantly change the infection rate, demonstrating that the apical infection mechanism of the BEL18 strain is independent of the ICJ integrity. This observation aligns with our explant results, showing that twice as many cells were infected by the BEL18 compared to the E70 in the epithelial cell layer. The preferential targeting of the apical surface by genotype II could potentially explain its ability to infect more cells rapidly. A recent study on equine herpes virus 1 demonstrated that restriction of infection via apical inoculation was overcome by disruption of ICJ with EGTA treatment, subsequently leading to virus infection at the basolateral cell surfaces [40]. This aligns with our findings in E70 infection that this strain favors infection via the basolateral surfaces, which was facilitated after EGTA treatment, while there was no effect on BEL18 strain, which prefers infection via the apical surface of\nthe cells. Taking all these results together, one may conclude that the E70 is likely less efficient in infecting epithelial cells in healthy pigs. It is likely that replication may only be facilitated when the epithelial cell layer is compromised, potentially due to exposure to toxins and proteases from other pathogens, or even the virus itself [41\u201344]. Despite the genotype II BEL18 strain\u2019s tendency for apical-side infection providing a higher initial transmissibility than genotype I, the infection rate reduction 48 hpi indicates a potential limitation to the replication of genotype II within the epithelial cells. The mechanism behind possible antiviral responses in the nasal mucosa should be investigated in the future study.\nWe also identified cytokeratin-negative infected cells in our PoRECs. Additional triple IF staining against ASFV, vimentin, and CD163 revealed that infected cells are neither mesenchymal/fibroblast cells nor monocytes/macrophages. This suggests that these cytokeratin-negative infected cells are probably non-differentiated epithelial cells. In the future study, an approach with various epithelial cell markers is necessary to better characterize these cells. Based on these findings, one may conclude that genotype I and genotype II use different receptors to enter the nasal mucosa. Future work will focus on the identification of these receptors.\nIn summary, the present study is the first that investigated ASFV infection in the nasal mucosa. The findings from our ex\u00a0 vivo model have revealed that ASFV demonstrates a broad cell tropism in the nasal mucosa. Furthermore, our in\u00a0 vitro model using primary respiratory epithelial cells highlights that epithelial cells are susceptible to ASFV and that the two genotypes use different surfaces for infection: genotype I basolaterally and genotype II apically. While our study provides valuable insights into the molecular and cellular aspects of ASFV infection within the nasal mucosa, they have inherent limitations as they cannot fully replicate the complex environment within a living organism. Therefore, future in\u00a0vivo studies will be crucial for gaining a more comprehensive understanding of ASFV pathogenesis in the nasal mucosa at early timepoints in infection. The knowledge gained from our current research will significantly facilitates the interpretation of subsequent in\u00a0 vivo results. Our study shed new light on the pathogenesis of ASFV in the respiratory system and emphasizes the possible role of the nasal route for ASFV transmission.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13567- 023- 01249-8.\nAdditional file\u00a01.
