Oh et al., https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjpc/zwad046.\nBy virtue of strategic advances in cancer care, clinical outcomes for patients with cancer have improved leading to a growing population of cancer survivors. It is well known that cancer treatment potentially has detrimental side-effects on cardiovascular health, recently defined as cancer-therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity (CTR-CVD).1 Additionally, all cancer survivors have an increased \u2018classical\u2019 cardiovascular risk (CVR), not always related to cancer treatment.2 As such, for some cancer types, cardiovascular mortality now exceeds cancer-related mortality in cancer survivors.3,4 This increased CVR is due to several treatment modalities, the effects of cancer itself, and due to the presence of shared risk factors for cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Shared risk factors include smoking and arterial hypertension, but also age and diabetes mellitus (DM).3,5 In fact, cancer patients may be at increased CVR with a higher burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) before the start of cancer-therapy as compared to the general population, possibly due to the presence of these shared risk factors.6 Vice versa, people suffering from CVD at a young age (<55 years) are at higher risk for the development of cancer, highlighting yet again the interaction between these disease entities and their risk factors.5\nDiabetes increases the risk for CTR-CVD and is considered as a moderate risk factor in the cardiotoxic risk assessment tool of the Heart-Failure Association-International Cardio-oncology Society.7 Around 13% of newly diagnosed cancer patients have DM and glucose control is worsened during cancer treatment, making this a very relevant risk factor.8 In the general population, DM is also recognized as an important CVR factor, increasing the risk of CVD about two-fold.3,9 In cancer survivors, the increased CVR compared to healthy controls seems to be even higher when additional CVR factors are present.1,3 It has been shown that DM in cancer survivors increases their risk of heart failure.10 However, the impact of DM on the CVR in adult cancer survivors had not been extensively studied.\nThis article by Oh. S. and colleagues describe the association of newonset DM with CVR in cancer survivors.11 Using data from the National Health Insurance Service, they retrospectively included adult cancer survivors and their general population 1:1 age-and-sex matched controls (without a history of cancer). Patients diagnosed with cancer between 2003 and 2005, who were alive at least 12 months after diagnosis were selected. Patients with CVD, cancer, or DM before the time of\ninclusion (2002) were excluded. Patients were divided into three groups according to the presence of new-onset diabetes:\n(1) Diabetes: Fasting blood glucose (FBG) \u2265 126 mg/dL (\u22657.0 mmol/ L) or medical record claims for DM or use of antidiabetic medication; (2) Prediabetes: FBG = 100\u2013125 mg/dL (5.5\u20136.9 mmol/L); (3) Normal FBG: FBG <100 mg/dL (<5.5 mmol/L).\nThe composite primary outcome was CVD, defined as CAD [International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10): I20\u2013I25] and stroke (ICD-10: 160\u2013169). Follow-up lasted until the end of 2015 or when the death occurred.\nIn total 10 398 people were included (5199 cancer survivors and 5199 matched controls), with 90.4 males per 100 females. Of these, 321 (6.2%) cancer survivors and 329 (6.3%) controls developed DM. During follow-up (average 4.9 years), 182 cases of CVD occurred. Incident rates were significantly higher in both cancer survivors and controls with DM compared to those without DM [incidence rate (IR) of 15.4 per 1000 per year (PY) for DM+ cancer survivors and IR = 13.6 per 1000 PY controls with DM].\nAfter adjustment for socio-economic status, health status [Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, hypercholesterolaemia, statin treatment], lifestyle (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity), and clinical characteristics (familial history of CVD, aspirin use), in both cancer survivors and matched controls, the presence of new-onset DM were associated with increased cardio-vascular (CV) risk. The magnitude of this association was significantly larger in cancer survivors compared to controls [adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.30; 95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.24\u20134.30 in cancer survivors vs. adjusted HR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.02\u20133.58 in controls, P = 0.011].\nOh. S. and colleagues also confirmed the presence of a higher CVD risk in cancer survivors compared to the controls proportion of individuals categorized as high risk (defined as SCORE \u22655%) 17.8% vs. 15.4% (P-value < 0.001).12 It should be noted, however, that the previous version of SCORE was used. Adult cancer survivors had higher blood pressure and cholesterol levels than controls, but cancer survivors had lower BMI and were less often smokers.\nWe need to be careful to apply these findings to the general population. First, patients were included from a Korean health insurance database, limiting translation to different populations. Second, although a heterogenic group of cancer survivors was studied, the distribution of cancer types is specific for this ethnic group and may differ from other\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /eurjpc/article/30/8/668/7126078 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 14 January 2024\nInvited Editorial 669\npopulations. The type of therapy varies between malignancies and national reimbursement policies. Also, shared risk factors differ between malignancies, and this affects the CVR in survivors. Therefore, the absence of information on cancer treatments is a limitation of the current study. Additionally, the risk for DM also increases with certain therapies, for example, hormone therapy in both breast and prostate cancer has been linked to an increased risk of diabetes.13,14 Moreover, up to 10% of patients develop DM after treatment with newer therapies, such as small molecules [proteasome-, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-, and rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)-inhibitors] and immunomodulating therapies, including stem cell transplantation.1 Finally, also classical chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and the use of corticosteroids during cancer treatment are involved in the development of DM in cancer survivors.15\nThird, only patients of 40 years or older were included, so findings cannot be translated to young(er) individuals, specifically childhood cancer survivors. Two similar studies were conducted on childhood- and adolescent cancer survivors. Berkman and colleagues identified a higher prevalence of DM in childhood cancer survivors (9.9% vs. 8.5% of controls; P = 0.006), but the presence of DM did not significantly increase the odds of CVD in childhood cancer survivors (OR 1.38; P = 0.08) whereas it did in a control population (OR 2.56, P < 0.001).16 A second study, by Winther et al. found an increased risk for CVD, in both childhood cancer survivors and controls, when DM was present compared to those without DM (HR 2.4 in both groups).17 Overall, childhood cancer survivors have increased CVR compared to healthy counterparts of the same age, whereas this increase in CVR is also present, but less severe in adults. Although speculative, this might explain why the effect of an additional risk factor, such as DM, is less pronounced in these patients.\nCurrent guidelines recommend both the use of HbA1C and FBG and repeat testing for the diagnosis of DM. As in the present study only single FBG values (apart from diagnoses in the medical records) were used, several patients might be misclassified.18 Similarly, the presence of CVD was only included if patients were hospitalized for more than 48 h. However, as elective coronary interventions are often performed during a short hospitalization period (< 48 h), patients with CAD who underwent elective treatment might have been missed.\nThe increased CVR linked to DM increases with duration.3 In this study, however, only patients with new-onset DM, after 2002, were included. Considering that follow-up averaged <5 years, studies on longterm effects are needed.\nDM increases the CVR early on after diagnosis, stressing the importance of CVR assessment in these patients and screening for diabetes. Whereas patients with short-standing DM (<10 years) are classified as \u2018moderate\u2019 risk for CVD in the general guidelines, the presence before cancer diagnosis might lead caregivers to consider these patients as (very) high risk.3 Moreover, the diagnosis of DM also emphasizes more stringent control of the overall CVR and (pharmaceutical) treatment of other risk factors becomes more likely.3 Interestingly, an association between new-onset DM and CVD was stronger in patients with additional risk factors such as physical inactivity, alcohol use, smoking, arterial hypertension, obesity, and lower socio-economic status.11 This highlights yet again the importance of a multifaceted approach in these patients to reduce their overall CVR. As such, the current work stresses the importance of rapid identification and control of all CV risk factors in all cancer survivors."
