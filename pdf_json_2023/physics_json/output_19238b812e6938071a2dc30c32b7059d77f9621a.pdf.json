Antipsychotics (APs), the cornerstone of treatment for PSDs, incur additional metabolic adversities including weight gain. Currently, major gaps exist in understanding psychosis illness biomarkers, as well as risk factors and mechanisms for AP-induced weight gain. Metabolomic profiles may identify biomarkers and provide insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of PSDs and antipsychotic-induced weight gain. In this 12-week prospective naturalistic study, we compared serum metabolomic profiles of 25 cases within approximately 1 week of starting an AP to 6 healthy controls at baseline to examine biomarkers of intrinsic metabolic dysfunction in PSDs. In 17 of the case participants with baseline and week 12 samples, we then examined changes in metabolomic profiles over 12 weeks of AP treatment to identify metabolites that may associate with AP-induced weight gain. In the cohort with pre-post data (n = 17), we also compared baseline metabolomes of participants who gained \u22655% baseline body weight to those who gained <5% to identify potential biomarkers of antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Minimally AP-exposed cases were distinguished from controls by six fatty acids when compared at baseline, namely reduced levels of palmitoleic acid, lauric acid, and heneicosylic acid, as well as elevated levels of behenic acid, arachidonic acid, and myristoleic acid (FDR < 0.05). Baseline levels of the fatty acid adrenic acid was increased in 11 individuals who experienced a clinically significant body weight gain (\u22655%) following 12 weeks of AP exposure as compared to those who did not (FDR = 0.0408). Fatty acids may represent illness biomarkers of PSDs and early predictors of AP-induced weight gain. The findings may hold important clinical implications\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org\nfor early identification of individuals who could benefit from prevention strategies to reduce future cardiometabolic risk, and may lead to novel, targeted treatments to counteract metabolic dysfunction in PSDs.\nKEYWORDS\nmetabolomics, fatty acids, antipsychotics, schizophrenia, weight gain, psychosis"

While various factors contribute to the metabolic risk in PSDs, antipsychotics (APs), the cornerstone of treatment for many PSDs, worsen elevated baseline risk through metabolic side effects such as weight gain (3\u20135). Notably, young patients without prior AP exposure (i.e., AP-na\u00efve) are especially susceptible to early APinduced weight gain (3, 6), although there is individual variability in the propensity to develop AP-induced weight gain that is not fully understood. Overall, there is a need to identify biomarkers and mechanisms of intrinsic and early AP-induced metabolic dysfunction to guide early targeted metabolic treatment strategies in PSD.\nIn addition to the effects of APs, metabolic dysfunction has been suggested to be intrinsic to the illness of PSDs. For instance, AP-na\u00efve first-episode psychosis patients demonstrate higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, elevated triglyceride levels, markers of glucose dysregulation, and increased risk for type 2 diabetes as compared to healthy controls, even prior to receiving AP treatment (7\u201311). The presence of metabolic abnormalities in AP-na\u00efve FEP patients, who are minimally affected by two major confounders, APs and illness duration, is suggestive of an intrinsic metabolic risk that is conferred by the illness of PSDs. However, the mechanisms underlying intrinsic metabolic dysfunction are understudied. Taken together, there is a need to examine AP-na\u00efve patients to identify biomarkers, predictors, and mechanisms of intrinsic and early AP-induced metabolic dysfunction, which would have important implications for guiding early treatment strategies for individuals with PSDs and developing novel, targeted treatments for metabolic dysfunction in PSDs.\nMetabolomics represents a novel tool with potential to shed light on metabolic dysfunction in PSD by characterizing global metabolite profiles. For example, metabolomic studies have identified that higher baseline concentrations, and change over time, of the lipid metabolite lysophosphatidylcholine 14:0 were associated with weight gain following olanzapine treatment in first-episode schizophrenia (12). Nonetheless, few studies have examined intrinsic illness markers of metabolic dysregulation and predictors of AP-induced weight gain in patients with minimal-tono previous exposure.\nThe objectives of the current pilot study were to: (1) examine whether minimally AP-exposed cases and controls present\nwith different metabolomic profiles that may represent illness biomarkers not confounded by long-term AP use; (2) identify predictors of AP-induced weight gain by comparing baseline metabolomes between minimally AP-exposed cases who do and do not develop clinically significant body weight (\u22655%) following 12 weeks of AP exposure; and (3) examine associations between changes in the metabolome and body weight over 12 weeks of AP exposure."

The approach of including patients based on symptoms and not specific diagnoses is also congruent with the Research domain criteria (RDoC) framework (18, 19).\nControls were included if they had an absence of current or past DSM-5 diagnosis other than a specific phobia or adjustment disorder. For both arms, exclusion criteria included clinically significant medical conditions (e.g., type 1 or 2 diabetes, kidney/liver disease, cancer, pregnancy), use of select groups of medications (e.g., treatment for lipids, glucose, or weight, antiinflammatory medications, immunosuppressants), and moderate to severe substance use determined either through medical chart review or MINI.\nCases were treated naturalistically with APs by their psychiatrist and followed for 12 weeks. Baseline and endpoint (week 12) assessments were used for metabolomics assays. Controls were assessed at baseline only. Assessments for both groups included anthropometric measures (body weight, height, BMI, and waist circumference), blood pressure, and fasting laboratory measures (glucose, insulin, and lipid panel)."

There were similarities in general separation approach and analysis method for the bile acids, as well with respect to separation by liquid chromatography and then analysis with triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (21).

            "text": "Growing evidence supports metabolomic signatures as potential biomarkers for intrinsic and early AP-induced metabolic dysfunction in PSD. In this study, comparisons of metabolomic profiles of minimally AP exposed cases vs. healthy controls at baseline, identified six differential fatty acids. These include reduced palmitoleic acid, lauric acid, and henieocosylic acid levels, and elevated behenic acid, myristoleic acid, and arachidonic acid levels, of which increased arachidonic acid levels are consistent with a previous study (26). Palmitoleic acid and arachidonic acid are particularly interesting due to their roles in inflammation;\ninflammation has been proposed to underly intrinsic metabolic dysfunction in PSDs (27). Specifically, palmitoleic acid-rich supplementation has been shown to improve dyslipidemia through anti-inflammatory action (28\u201330). Alternatively, arachidonic acid is an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA); PUFAs, which are pro-inflammatory mediators. As such, lower circulating levels of palmitoleic acid and higher circulating levels of arachidonic acid may contribute to inflammation and hence intrinsic metabolic dysfunction in PSDs. Moreover, the conversion of arachidonic acid into inflammatory prostaglandins produces lipid peroxidation products, leading to oxidative stress (31), which in turn has been linked to metabolic dysfunction and PSD (32\u201335).\nHowever, several association studies have illustrated that elevated circulating palmitoleic acid levels are found in individuals with obesity and metabolic syndrome (36, 37), and associate with higher triglyceride levels and insulin resistance in the general population (38, 39), contrary to the reduced palmitoleic acids observed in our study. Nonetheless, one study demonstrated that in individuals who are at risk for type 2 diabetes, reduced palmitoleic acid levels associate with greater insulin resistance (40). These findings perhaps suggest that the reduction in palmitoleic acid levels found in this study reflects the early, insulin resistant state commonly observed among AP-na\u00efve first-episode psychosis patients (41). Given the small size of this pilot study, an interesting future direction would be to expand these results to a larger patient population to determine if reduced palmitoleic acid and increased arachidonic acid in serum may represent biomarkers of intrinsic metabolic dysfunction in PSD.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 05 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 Box and whisker plot of normalized serum adrenic acid concentrations. The asterisk indicates that adrenic acid concentrations in the high-weight gain group were significantly di erent from the low-weight gain group (FDR = 0.0408).\nWith respect to the other fatty acids identified as differentiating the cases and controls at baseline, behenic acid has been associated with anti-inflammatory activity in mice (42), and proinflammatory activity in humans (43). Heneicosylic acid appears to be minimally studied but may be inflammatory when considering it is a saturated fatty acid (44), whereas myristoleic acid and, conversely, the saturated lauric acid have been linked to anti-inflammatory activity (45\u201347). Figure 2 describes associations between fatty acids identified as significantly different between cases and controls in this pilot study, and whether published literature generally supports their role as inflammatory, or anti-inflammatory.\nFollowing 12 weeks of AP exposure, cases had increased in body weight, BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. This increase in weight despite the fact that many of the cases were using antipsychotics with lower weight gain propensity is not necessarily surprising, given that research has suggested all antipsychotics cause weight gain in patients with minimal past exposure, but that the extent of weight gain is different between individual medications (3). Additionally, a subgroup developed clinically significant body weight gain (\u22655%) and were distinguished at baseline by elevated levels of the fatty acid, adrenic acid. Studies have shown that specific triacylglycerols predict increases in body weight and BMI following AP treatment in first-episode psychosis patients (12). Our study extends these findings, suggesting elevation of adrenic acid as an additional novel early predictor of AP-induced weight gain. However, we were not able to replicate research from other teams with respect to the extent of changes in lipids; likely this was attributable to different testing platforms and identifiable metabolites, among other differences in study design, including length of medication exposure (48, 49). It is notable that elevations in adrenic acid have been associated with obesity (50), supporting its potential\nphysiological relevance as a predictor of AP-induced weight gain. Adrenic acid is an omega-6 PUFA, which acts as pro-inflammatory mediators. Thus, it may contribute to inflammation, which may underly AP-induced metabolic dysfunction in patients with PSD (27). These findings may have important clinical implications to help identify individuals who are at high risk for AP-induced weight gain and may benefit from early prevention strategies. However, given the preliminary nature of this study, these results must be replicated in larger studies with longer duration of follow up.\nTaken together, the prominence of fatty acid dysregulation in this study extends previous findings suggesting that dysregulated lipid metabolism may underlie psychosis illness and AP-induced metabolic dysfunction (12, 26). Our findings corroborate the growing body of evidence supporting individual variabilities in risk for AP-induced metabolic dysfunction and the importance of identifying early biomarkers that predict AP-induced weight gain.\nWhile the physiological relevance of the identified biomarkers reinforces the clinical value of the findings, several limitations should be noted. First, relative to the case group, the control group had a small sample size, resulting in part from COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, where treatment studies with patients were allowed to continue, whereas healthy control studies were halted. The control group also had a larger percentage of patients who identified as Asian, as compared to the case group. These factors may have limited the statistical power in the analyses. Other potential confounders include physical activity levels and diet patterns, which were not considered in the present investigation. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of APs and diagnoses among cases may also have confounded the findings. While there is evidence demonstrating that the impact of antipsychotics on metabolic side effects is potentially disease agnostic (15), there are documented differences among antipsychotics in their ability to cause metabolic\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 2 Venn diagram shows the pro and anti-inflammatory fatty acid metabolites that were significantly di erent between cases and controls, with behenic acid, arachidonic acid, and myristoleic acid observed to be higher in cases while palmitoleic acid, lauric acid, and heneicosylic acid were higher in controls.

Palmitoleic acid, myristoleic acid, lauric acid appear to have anti-inflammatory actions.\nside effects (51, 52). This may, in part, explain why there were no detected changes in metabolites over 12 weeks of AP treatment associated with body weight change. Finally, the minimally exposed AP cases in the study had some AP exposure at baseline, which may have hindered examination of illness metabolomics independent of AP exposure. Thismay also have prevented investigation of the very early metabolic changes induced by APs, especially considering that changes in glucose metabolism can be induced by a single dose of APs (53). Nonetheless, there are ethical challenges to keeping patients AP-na\u00efve for research purposes, which renders it difficult to impose too many exclusion criteria for an already difficult population to recruit. It is also possible that studies in patients with minimal, vs. absent, antipsychotic exposure may be more valuable to translating precision health research into practice given that it is unlikely antipsychotic treatment would be withheld to wait for biomarker results in a patient presenting acutely with psychosis."
