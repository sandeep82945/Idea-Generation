Development of Water-Soluble Metallodendrimers: The synthesized compounds showed issues with solubility in biological media, which can limit their therapeutic applicability. Future research could focus on modifying the dendritic structure or the peripheral groups of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers to enhance their solubility in aqueous solutions. This could improve their bioavailability and allow for accurate selectivity studies against healthy non-tumorigenic cell lines.

Mechanism of Action Studies: The paper suggests that the cytotoxic activity of the dirhodium(II,II) complexes and metallodendrimers might be related to their ability to bind to DNA and interfere with cellular replication processes, similar to cisplatin. Future studies could aim to elucidate the precise mechanisms of action of these compounds, including DNA interaction, enzyme inhibition, and the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. This would involve a combination of molecular biology techniques, including genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses.

Selective Targeting and Drug Delivery Systems: Since dendritic structures can potentially improve selective cellular uptake due to their size and the EPR effect, future research could explore the conjugation of these metallodendrimers with targeting ligands or antibodies that recognize specific markers on cancer cells. This would enhance the selectivity of the compounds for cancer cells over healthy cells, potentially reducing side effects and improving therapeutic outcomes.

In Vivo Efficacy and Toxicity Studies: While the paper reports on in vitro cytotoxicity against ovarian cancer cell lines, future research should involve in vivo studies to assess the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and toxicity of these compounds in animal models of cancer. This would provide valuable data on their therapeutic potential and safety profile, which are crucial for the development of any new anticancer drug.

Combination Therapy Studies: Given the complex nature of cancer and the development of resistance to chemotherapy, investigating the use of dirhodium(II,II) complexes and metallodendrimers in combination with other anticancer agents could be beneficial. Future studies could evaluate the synergistic effects of these compounds with existing chemotherapeutics, targeted therapies, or immunotherapies to enhance anticancer efficacy and overcome drug resistance mechanisms.
