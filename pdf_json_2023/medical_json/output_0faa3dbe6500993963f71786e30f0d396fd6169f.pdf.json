Design: Observational, quality improvement study. Setting: University medical center with a gastrointestinal endoscopy service performing \u223c1,000 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and \u223c1,000 endoscopic ultrasound endoscope procedures annually. Methods: Duodenoscope and linear echoendoscope sampling (from the elevator mechanism and instrument channel) was performed from June 2020 through September 2021. Operational changes during this period included standard reprocessing with high-level disinfection with ethylene oxide gas sterilization (HLD\u2013ETO) was switched to double high-level disinfection (dHLD) (June 16, 2020\u2013July 15, 2020), and duodenoscopes changed to disposable tip model (March 2021). The frequency of contamination for the co-primary outcomes were characterized by calculated risk ratios. Results: The overall pathogenic contamination rate was 4.72% (6 of 127). Compared to duodenoscopes, linear echoendoscopes had a contamination risk ratio of 3.64 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69\u201319.1). Reprocessing using HLD-ETO was associated with a contamination risk ratio of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.06\u20131.54). Linear echoendoscopes undergoing dHLD had the highest risk of contamination (2 of 18, 11.1%), and duodenoscopes undergoing HLD-ETO and the lowest risk of contamination (0 of 53, 0%). Duodenoscopes with a disposable tip had a 0% contamination rate (0 of 27). Conclusions: We did not detect a significant reduction in endoscope contamination using HLD-ETO versus dHLD reprocessing. Linear echoendoscopes have a risk of contamination similar to that of duodenoscopes. Disposable tips may reduce the risk of duodenoscope contamination. (Received 28 September 2022; accepted 15 December 2022; electronically published 16 January 2023) In the early 2010s, multiple studies described infections attributed to duodenoscopes contaminated with multidrug-resistant pathogens during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.1,2 This patient safety risk may be due to inadequate reprocessing or an intrinsic risk of the endoscope design because duodenoscope features may harbor pathogens despite appropriate manual cleaning and the use of automated endoscope reprocessors.3 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that facilities perform microbiologic surveillance of duodenoscopes to detect the adequacy of reprocessing. The FDA also recommends that facilities consider repeating high-level disinfection (ie, double high-level disinfection or dHLD), performing high-level disinfection followed by ethylene oxide gas sterilization (HLDETO), or use of a liquid chemical sterilant.4 Additionally, the FDA recommends the use of duodenoscopes with disposable components.5 Prior studies have not resolved uncertainty regarding the Author for correspondence: Ashley Ayres, E-mail: ayresam@upmc.edu Cite this article: Ayres AM, et al.

This metric was the denominator for frequency of endoscope contamination. Sample site refers to either the instrument channel or elevator mechanism, and the sample refers to the specimen obtained from the instrument channel or the specimen obtained from the elevator mechanism.

The coprimary outcome was the comparison of the pathogenic contamination rate between duodenoscopes and linear echoendoscopes processed by either reprocessing method.\nMoreover, 5 secondary analyses were performed using the pathogenic contamination rate unless otherwise noted (eg, outcome of \u22651 pathogenic bacteria present in a sample of the elevator mechanism or instrument channel). We performed the primary analysis stratified by duodenoscopes and linear echoendoscopes type to assess effect modification by device type in the relationship between reprocessing method (HLD-ETO vs dHLD) and the frequency of contamination. Among duodenoscopes, we compared the frequency of contamination among standard model duodenoscopes and those with a detachable and disposable endoscope tip to determine whether this design modification resulted in a lower contamination rate. The primary outcome was compared to samples from the instrument channel and the elevator mechanism to understand the relative and independent contributions to duodenoscope contamination from these sampling sites. An analysis varying the outcome definition was performed to estimate the additional potential risk of endoscope contamination and transmission when fungal pathogens were considered in addition to bacterial pathogens. In these analyses, we qualitatively compared the primary analysis with alternate outcomes of pathogenic bacteria plus Candida spp and pathogenic bacteria plus any fungi. Lastly, we compared the frequency of the primary outcome among samples processed at a clinical microbiology laboratory versus a commercial environmental culture laboratory to validate the consistency of very similarmicrobiologicmethods between these 2 laboratories. The change to a commercial laboratory occurred several months after dHLD use concluded (Fig. 1). Therefore, the comparison of outcomes between clinical and commercial laboratory processing was restricted to endoscopes reprocessed byHLD-ETO.\nIn a routine investigation, we followed a culture-positive endoscope (>1 CFU pathogenic bacteria or >10 CFU of any other bacteria or fungi). Endoscope use data were obtained from the automated reprocessor. Electronic health record review of patients who had a procedure with the affected endoscopewithin the prior 3 months or after the endoscope was last surveillance culture negative was performed to identify microbiologic laboratory findings with a culture matching or potentially matching the endoscopecultured isolate. At the time of endoscope culture positivity, reprocessing practices were reviewed for potential breaches in reprocessing protocols, but none were found during this investigation."

The pathogenic contamination rate was defined as the number of endoscope cultures positive for the growth of \u22651 CFU of \u22651 pathogenic organism in either the elevator mechanism or instrument channel specimen divided by the number of endoscopes cultured. Pathogenic bacteria were defined as Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp, Pantoea spp, Acinetobacter spp, Stenotrophomonas spp, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, and Staphylococcus aureus.11 As an additional analysis of the findings, the definition of pathogenic organism was modified in 2 ways: (1) this list of pathogenic bacteria or growth of Candida spp and (2) this list of pathogenic bacteria or any fungal growth. As part of our institutional guidelines, when an endoscope culture became positive with either >1 CFU pathogenic bacteria or >10 CFU of any other bacteria or fungi, the sampled endoscope was removed from use, reprocessed, and recultured before reuse.

Contamination was highest with linear echoendoscopes undergoing dHLD (2 of 18, 11.1%), and was lowest in duodenoscopes undergoing HLDETO (0 of 53, 0%), including 27 endoscopes with disposable tips and 26 with nondisposable tips. The results of a post hoc analysis of these outcomes, excluding endoscope culturing events performed to confirm resolution of a pathogenic bacteria, is presented in Supplementary Table S2 (online).\nThe pathogenic contamination rate was 2.4% (2 of 82) for all models of duodenoscopes disinfected by either dHLD or HLDETO. For models without a detachable tip, the pathogenic contamination rate was 3.6% (2 of 55). The pathogenic contamination rate was 0% (0 of 27) for models with a detachable tip\nFor 3 culturing events, the elevator channel was sampled but the instrument channel sample could not be processed. For 1 culturing event, the instrument channel was the only site sampled. All 4 of these instances were due to sample leak during transport to the laboratory. The pathogenic contamination rate from elevator mechanism samples was 4.8% (6 of 126), and the pathogenic contamination rate from instrument channel samples was 2.4% (3 of 124).Moreover, 9 culturing events were positive for\u22651 pathogenic bacteria on the instrument channel or the elevator channel. Among them, 3 cultures were positive on both the instrument channel and elevator mechanism samples; 3 cultures were only positive from the instrument channel sample; and 3 cultures were only positive from the elevator mechanism sample. Of the 3\nendoscope cultures positive from both the elevator mechanism and instrument channel, 1 was identified as having the same pathogen on both, which was Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the other 2 samples, a different species of pathogen was identified from each sample. In both cases, Acinetobacter sp was identified from the instrument channel and Staphylococcus aureus from the elevator mechanism.\nThe gross contamination rate among all endoscope culturing events was 71.7% (91 of 127). The gross contamination rate varied from 70.0% to 74.5% among duodenoscopes and linear echoendoscopes reprocessed by dHLD or HLD-ETO (Supplementary Table S3 online).\nThe overall pathogenic contamination rate increased from 4.7% to 10.2%. when including Candida spp and to 14.2% when including all pathogenic fungi with pathogenic bacteria (when the definition of significant pathogen was broadened). The frequency of pathogen contamination using these 2 alternative definitions by endoscope type and reprocessing method is described in Supplementary Table S4 (online).\nThe gross contamination rate identified at the clinical microbiology laboratory (N= 67) versus a commercial environmental laboratory (N= 60) did not change appreciably for culturing events overall (71.6% and 71.7%, respectively) (Supplementary Table S5 online). Absolute differences stratified by endoscope type and reprocessing method were <7%. The gross and pathogenic contamination rate among endoscope samples, by endoscope sampling location, are presented in Supplementary Table S6 (online). No patient had a clinical infection attributable to a culture-positive endoscope."

            "text": "In this observational study of duodenoscope and linear echoendoscope contamination, overall contamination with \u22651 pathogenic bacteria on the instrument channel or elevator mechanism of duodenoscopes was 4.7%. Linear echoendoscopes had a higher though statistically nonsignificant contamination rate than duodenoscopes (8.9% vs 2.4%), and the overall risk of contamination after HLD-ETO was lower than following reprocessing with dHLD (2.5% vs 8.5%), also not a statistically significant difference. The use of a duodenoscope with a disposable tip may decrease the risk of duodenoscope contamination after reprocessing. Adding\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2022.319 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nCandida spp to the definition of potential pathogens transmitted by duodenoscopemay significantly increase the estimate of reprocessing failure.\nEven though there was some difference between ETO and dHLD, ETO does not eliminate contamination. A meta-analysis showed that switching to either ETO or dHLD led to an estimated contamination rate of 9.2%, which is within the range of the contamination rates we observed.1 Evaluations of other interventions are needed to help decrease transmission risk.\nDisposable tips on duodenoscopes have been suggested to improve contamination rates. In our study, disposable tips eliminated the positivity rate in duodenoscopes, but the sample size was small. To date, this study is the first to evaluate the contamination rates of endoscopes designed with a disposable tip. Further study is warranted to validate the lower contamination risk.12,13\nLinear echoendoscopes have been underappreciated as an additional risk for contamination. The FDA and other organizations have focused their efforts on the contamination rate of duodenoscopes.4 Previous studies have noted rates of contamination in linear echoendoscopes comparable to our findings.7,14 In our study, we concurrently cultured both duodenoscopes and linear echoendoscopes to provide amore direct comparison of the relative risk of linear echoendoscope contamination. We found contamination rates to be comparable to those observed in duodenoscopes. Linear echoendoscopes should be included in microbiologic surveillance to ensure high-quality reprocessing.\nOur findings support assessing risk beyond bacterial contamination. Candida and pathogenic fungi have not been correlated with duodenoscope-associated infections to date but have been shown to have significant outcomes on patients who develop infection.15 In this study, we identified no clinically significant infections resulting from endoscope transmission. However, more information is needed to establish the clinical risk of positive endoscopes. Increasing the microbiologic methods of culturing to include fungal contamination could show possible unidentified prior risk.\nThis observational study had several limitations. Our comparison of HLD-ETO and dHLD was not randomized and covered different periods because this was a natural experiment based on an involuntary switch that affected only reprocessing without changing other practices. This study was a quality improvement project; it was underpowered for power calculations and did not include predetermined sample sizes. The small sample sizes made it difficult to demonstrate statistically significant differences in the effectiveness of dHLD versus HLD-ETO. However, this study was conducted in a real-world setting in a healthcare facility.\nContamination rates with pathogenic bacteria remained \u223c5% in this observational quality improvement study even after all manufacturer recommendations for reprocessing were followed. Risk was not eliminated with the use of ETO sterilization. Incorporating linear echoendoscopes into facilities risk assessments is vital to decreasing risk. Expanding risk to incorporate fungi will be vital in understanding current unknown risk. Additional information is needed to determine the value of disposable tips and the decision on dHLD versus HLD-ETO.\nSupplementary material.
