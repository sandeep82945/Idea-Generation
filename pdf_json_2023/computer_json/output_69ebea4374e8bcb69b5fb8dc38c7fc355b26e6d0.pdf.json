    "abstractText": "In this paper we address the possibility that in a competitive facility location model, one of the existing competing facilities will go out of business. We find the best location for a new facility protecting against such a possibility. Four commonly used decision rules (optimistic, pessimistic, minimax regret, and expected value) are analyzed and optimally solved within a given relative accuracy. The results of extensive computational experiments are reported. Special upper bounds, that may be a basis for other optimization problems, are designed and run time was improved by more than 1,000 times. The largest instance of 10 existing competing facilities and 20,000 demand points was solved in less than one second by each of the four decision criteria. The idea of possible scenarios can be investigated by other models in future research.",

            "text": "A decision maker is faced with uncertainty about future conditions. There are several possible scenarios that are termed \u201cstates of the world\u201d. A list of options is available and the decision maker needs to select one of the options without knowing for sure which state of the world will take place. There are four widely used decision analysis rules (optimistic, pessimistic, minimax regret and expected value). For details see, for example, Goodwin and Wright (2014); Lawrence and Pasternack (2002); Winston and Albright (2016); Winston and Goldberg (2004), and the discussion in Section 2.\nWe apply these decision analysis rules to the location of a new competing facility among p existing competing facilities with future uncertainty. There are p + 1 states of the world: (i) all existing facilities remain in the market, (ii) each one of the existing facilities will no longer exist once the new facility enters the market and its location has already been determined. The same analysis and solution approaches can be applied to possibilities that more than one facility will\nfail. The number of options (selection of the location for the new facility) is infinite. Any point in the area is an option for the location of the new facility. In brick and mortar competing facilities, such as shopping malls, it can be very costly to move the facility to a better location once it is established, and is thus not included in the list of options. Our goal is to find a good location for the new facility that will protect against such uncertainties.\nAny model for estimating the market share captured at each location can be applied. We selected for demonstration purposes the gravity model (Huff, 1964, 1966; Reilly, 1931) which is commonly used for estimating the market share captured (for example, Aboolian et al., 2007a,b, 2009; Bell et al., 1998; Ferna\u0301ndez et al., 2007; Hodgson, 1981; Sa\u0301iz et al., 2009). The specific gravity model is detailed in Section 3. For a review of various competitive models see Drezner (2022).\nThere are a few papers that apply decision analysis rules (mainly the minimax regret rule) to location models. For example, Averbakh and Berman (2000) applied the minimax regret rule to the median location problem and Puerto et al. (2009) applied it to the single-facility ordered median location problem. Daskin et al. (1997) investigated a probabilistic minimax regret model. Drezner (2009) incorporated future market conditions, such as changes in future buying power distribution, into the gravity model. Future market conditions were analyzed as a set of possible scenarios. The minimax regret rule is applied.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the four decision analysis rules are reviewed and analyzed, and in Section 3 the gravity model used to estimate the captured market share by facilities is detailed. In Section 4 the solution procedures designed for finding the optimal solution within a given relative accuracy \u01eb > 0 for the four decision rules models are constructed. Extensive computational experiments are reported in Section 5, and we summarize and discuss the contribution of the paper in Section 6."

The three that do not require probability estimates are: (i) hoping for the best possible outcome (optimistic), (ii) protecting against the worst possible outcome (pessimistic), and (iii) minimizing the maximum gap (regret)\nfor each state of the world between the profit at the selected option and the maximum possible profit for that state of the world (minimax regret).\nOptimistic rule: The location that gives the largest market share among all states of the world\nis selected.\nPessimistic rule: For each location we find the lowest market share among all states of the world.\nThe location with the highest of these lowest market shares is selected.\nMinimax Regret: For each state of the world we find the largest market share among all locations.\nThe regret for a particular location and a particular state of the world is the difference between the largest market share for this state of the world and the market share captured by the selected location. The regret value for a specific location is the largest regret among all states of the world for this location. The location with the smallest regret value is selected.\nSuppose that the probability of each state of the world can be reliably estimated and thus\nassumed given.

            "text": "In the computational experiments we applied p + 1 states of the world: no facility failing, or one facility failing. If we also consider the possibility that two competing facilities may go out of business, we get 1 + p+ p(p\u22121)2 states of the world which will just increase the size of the problem. As long as the market share can be calculated for each state of the world, it can be solved the same way for reasonable size p. Including all possible facility removals, including removal of all p facilities, leads to 2p states of the world which is practically solvable for p \u2264 10. However, considering more than p+ 1 states of the world may complicate the estimation of the probabilities for each state of the world. For example, when removing more than one facility there may be exogenous forces, such as a recession, that lead to a correlation between the probabilities of facilities going out of business. It is also possible that the new facility is part of a chain and some of the existing facilities belong to the same chain. The objective is to maximize the market share captured by the whole chain.\nSuch a situation does not affect the analysis or solution approaches. In the rest of the paper we assume that no facility failing is always a possibility, and there are p\u0302 additional states of the world (in the computational experiments p\u0302 = p).\nThe market share at location X, when no facility goes out of business, is defined as M0(X). The maximum market share is captured at location X = X0. When a combination of facilities 1 \u2264 j \u2264 p\u0302 go out of business, the market share captured by a new facility at location X is defined as Mj(X) and its best location is X = Xj . All these market share values can be calculated by any of the available competitive location models. The location Xj that maximizes Mj(X) for j = 0, 1, . . . , p\u0302 can be found within a relative accuracy \u01eb > 0 by Big Triangle Small Triangle (BTST, Drezner and Suzuki, 2004), or Big Square Small Square (BSSS, Hansen et al., 1981). See also Section 4.1 for details of the modified BSSS algorithm that was specially designed for the models analyzed and tested in this paper.\nLemma 1: M0(X) \u2264 Mj(X) for j = 1, . . . , p\u0302 and any location X.\nProof: Removing competing facilities reduces competition and the market share captured by the new facility at location X cannot decrease regardless of the competitive model used. \u2737\nLemma 2: M0(X0) \u2264 Mj(Xj) for j = 1, . . . , p\u0302.\nProof: By Lemma 1 and the optimality of Xj : M0(X0) \u2264 Mj(X0) \u2264 Mj(Xj). \u2737\nProperty 1: By the optimistic rule the best location is Xk for which Mk(Xk) = max 1\u2264j\u2264p\u0302 {Mj(Xj)}.\nProof: By Lemma 2 M0(X0) cannot be the maximum market share (it may tie it). Therefore, the maximum market share is the maximum among Mj(Xj) for j = 1, . . . , p\u0302. Any location X cannot increase the market share for any Mj(Xj) because Mj(Xj) is the maximum market share for this state of the world. \u2737\nProperty 2: By the pessimistic rule the best location is X0 with the objective value M0(X0).\nProof: At location X0, M0(X0) \u2264 Mj(X0) for j = 1, . . . , p\u0302 by Lemma 1. Therefore, the minimum value of the objective function at X0 for all states of the world is M0(X0). For any location X, by the maximality of X0, M0(X) \u2264 M0(X0) so the minimum value of all states of the world cannot exceed M0(X0) for any location X. \u2737\nProperty 3: By the minimax regret rule the best location X minimizes max 0\u2264j\u2264p {Mj(Xj)\u2212Mj(X)}.\nProof: The regret of selecting location X when facility j (or several facilities) go out of business (including the case j = 0) is Mj(Xj)\u2212Mj(X). The maximum regret for all the possible states of the world at location X is max 0\u2264j\u2264p\u0302 {Mj(Xj)\u2212Mj(X)}. By the minimax regret rule the objective is to minimize the maximum regret by selecting the best location X. \u2737\nIn summary, by the optimistic rule we \u201chope\u201d that the facility (or facilities) that go out of business is the combination that will increase the market share the most for the new facility. By the pessimistic rule we protect against the possibility that no competing facility will fail. These are extreme cases. The minimax regret rule seems to be the most sensible to apply when no probabilities for each state of the world can be reliably determined.\nFor the first three decision rules we do not need an estimate of the probabilities for each state\nof the world. Assume that a set of probabilities \u03c00, \u03c01, . . . , \u03c0p\u0302 is given such that p\u0302 \u2211\nj=0 \u03c0j = 1. The\nfollowing property follows directly the definition of the expected value.\nProperty 4: By the expected value rule the best location is the X that maximizes p\u0302 \u2211\nj=0 \u03c0jMj(X)."

All the proposed formulations and solution approaches for finding the best location for a new competing facility can be implemented for any model as long as M(X) can be calculated for each location X. There are n demand points in the area, and p existing competing facilities. We opted to apply the commonly used gravity model (Huff, 1964, 1966) which is based on the following definitions.\nBi is the buying power at demand point i for i = 1, . . . , n, Aj is the attractiveness level of facility j for j = 1, . . . , p, A is the attractiveness level of the new facility,\ndij is the distance between demand point i and existing facility j, di(X) is the distance between demand point i and location X, f(d, \u03bb) is the distance decay function at distance d,\n\u03bb is the parameter of the distance decay function,\nThe estimated market share captured by the new facility located at X when all j facilities\noperate is according to the traditional gravity model:\nM0(X) =\nn \u2211\ni=1\nBi Af(di(X), \u03bb)\nAf(di(X), \u03bb) + p \u2211\nk=1\nAkf(dik, \u03bb)\n. (1)\nThe gravity model was originally proposed by Reilly (1931). He suggested that a community between two large metropolitan areas will divide their patronage proportionally to the size of the metropolitan area and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from them. This means a power decay of 1 d2 which imitates gravitational force where the size of the metropolitan area is its mass, hence the name the gravity model. In the competitive facilities location literature, the gravity model has been the focus of many research papers (for example, Aboolian et al., 2007a; Bell et al., 1998; Drezner, 1994a,b; Drezner et al., 1998; Huff, 1964, 1966; Jain and Mahajan, 1979, to name a few). The most widely used decay functions are the power decay f(d, \u03bb) = 1 d\u03bb (originally proposed by Huff, 1964, 1966, as a generalization of 1 d2 ), and the exponential decay f(d, \u03bb) = e\u2212\u03bbd (proposed by Hodgson, 1981; Wilson, 1976). Drezner (2006) found that the exponential decay function fits real data of shopping malls better than power decay.\nSome modifications to the basic gravity model were recently proposed. Drezner et al. (2020) suggested to replace the attractiveness multiplier Aj by a facility dependent distance decay parameter \u03bbj . Drezner et al. (2018) suggested that attractiveness levels are stochastic and not constants. Not all customers have the same perception of the attractiveness level. Drezner et al. (2022a) observed that ignoring \u201ctime spent in facilities\u201d may bias market share estimates in a competitive environment. All distances are modified by adding the same extra distance."

Drezner and Drezner (1997) suggested to replace d2 with d2 + 0.24S where S is the area of a \u201cdemand point\u201d. We experimented with demand points distributed in a 10 by 10\nsquare. We assume that the area of demand point i is proportional to its buying power Bi and they cover the whole square. The area of the square is 100. Therefore, the area of demand point i is 100Bin \u2211\nk=1\nBk\n.

Drezner and Drezner (2004) solved optimally the gravity model with a power decay function by BTST. They tested two upper bounds. One simple upper bound, which can be used for any decreasing function of the distance, is to replace each distance di(X) from a demand point to X in the polygon by the shortest possible distance to that polygon. The objective function evaluated by the shortest distances is an upper bound.\nA more complicated upper bound designed in Drezner and Drezner (2004) was more effective. Drezner (2007) suggested a general upper bound for functions which are a sum of terms. Each term is a function of the distance between a demand point and location X, and each term can be represented as a difference between two convex functions of the distance. Note that functions may not be convex by the coordinates (x, y) but can be convex as functions of the distance.\nLet ai be the shortest squared distance between demand point i and the polygon, and fi(ai) is defined by (3). We propose two upper bounds. The first upper bound, which applies to any declining function of the distance, (similar to the one proposed in Drezner and Drezner, 2004) is:\nUB1 = n \u2211\ni=1\nfi(ai) (4)\nbecause the captured market share declines by the distance and the maximum possible value for each demand point is at the point with the minimum possible distance. The second upper bound derived below takes longer to calculate, but is much more effective. The solution algorithm runs more than 1,000 times faster. See Section 4.2.2.\nThe function M(X) by (3) is not convex. As a function of the distance z, each term is\nABi A+\u03b1Bi\u03b3i+\u03b3iz2 which can be represented as a difference between two convex functions of z (was actually done in Drezner, 2007). We propose a similar approach by defining the function by the square of the distance rather than the distance: fi(z) = ABi\nA+\u03b1Bi\u03b3i+\u03b3iz . This function is convex in\nz in the segment ai \u2264 z \u2264 bi where ai \u2265 0 is the minimum squared distance to the polygon and bi > ai is the maximum squared distance to it.\nThe formulas for the minimum squared distance to a square centered at (x0, y0) and a side 2s\nis (Drezner et al., 2022b):\nai = [max {|xi \u2212 x0| \u2212 s, 0}] 2 + [max {|yi \u2212 y0| \u2212 s, 0}] 2 . (5)\nand the maximum squared distance is:\nbi = [|xi \u2212 x0|+ s] 2 + [|yi \u2212 y0|+ s] 2 .

Calculate UB2 by (12).\nNote that there is no need to save any value for each demand point and only one loop over all the demand points is required. If facility j is removed, ai and bi do not change but the functions in Step 2b are calculated with facility j missing, and \u03b1i recalculated. We define UB1 and UB2 when facility j is missing as UB1(j) and UB2(j) (j = 0 if no facility is missing).\nLemma 4: UB2(j) \u2264 UB1(j).\nProof: The parameter ai is the shortest squared distance to the polygon. Therefore, d 2 i (X) \u2265 ai for any point X in the polygon, and in particular to the solution point of (9). \u2737\nIt is very unlikely that UB2(j) = UB1(j). It can happen if the shortest squared distance to the polygon for all demand points is to the same point. For example, in case of squares, we can have a large square that contains all demand points, and a little square at the corner of the large square, and no demand point is in the two strips originating at the little square along two sides of the large\nsquare. All shortest distances are to the vertex of the little square which is in the interior of the large square. In this example, the shortest distance from the center of gravity to the little square is also to the same vertex."

In the computational\nexperiments we applied UB2(j) and do not report the number of squares or the run times because they are negligible."

It is based on the pseudo random number generator proposed by Law and Kelton (1991). Integer starting seed r1 and multiplier \u03bb, which are odd numbers not divisible by 5, are selected. Note that r1 can be an even number not ending with a zero. We used \u03bb = 314, 227. The sequence is generated by the following rule for k \u2265 1:\nrk+1 = \u03bbrk \u2212 \u230a \u03bbrk\n1, 000, 000 \u230b \u00d7 1, 000, 000\nFor demand points with coordinates between 0 and 10, a coordinate is rk100,000 . The x-coordinates were generated by r1 = 105, 673, and the y-coordinates were generated by r1 = 123, 461. Up to n = 20, 000 demand points were generated. The buying powers Bk were generated between 1 and 5 by r1 = 329, 453 and Bk = 1 + 4 rk\n1,000,000 . We also generated 10 competing facilities by\nr1 = 444, 939 and r1 = 526, 987 for the x and y coordinates, respectively.

The new facility\nhas an attractiveness of A = 1.\nThe parameters of the competing facilities are reported in Table 2 and their locations depicted in Figure 1. In Table 2 we report the locations of the competing facilities and their attractiveness levels. The market share captured presently by the competing facilities before the new facility is located are reported for n = 100, 1, 000, 10, 000, and 20,000 demand points."

            "heading": "5.2 Summary of Results",
            "text": "We experimented with nine instances for number of demand points between 100 and 20,000. For each n we solved 11 instances: no competing facility going out of business (j = 0), and facility 1 \u2264 j \u2264 10 going out of business. The upper bound UB2(j) is applied.\nThe optimal locations of the new facility in all cases are detailed in Table 3 (reporting also the market share captured by the new facility), and are depicted in Figure 1 for n = 20, 000. We do not report run times because they are negligible, as reported in Table 1. The total run time for solving all 99 instances was only 3.62 seconds. The results do not change much as the value of n increases. This is because the results are governed by the locations of the competing facilities and the demand points are randomly spread in the square with random buying power for each. The\npessimistic solution is, by Lemma 2, always at the location of the \u201cno-fail\u201d j = 0 solution.\nWhen facilities 1, 3, 4, 7, 10 go out of business, the \u201chole\u201d created between surrounding competing facilities that remain in business attracts the new facility because more buying power becomes available than is available near facility 6 shown in the zoom-in area in Figure 1. Facility 6 belongs\nto this group of facilities. The best location for the new facility is relatively close to the location of the failed facility. On the other hand, the hole generated by removal of facilities 2, 5, 8, 9 does not contain enough buying power and the most buying power is captured near the j = 0 (pessimistic) location.\nIt turns out that the removal of Facility 6 leaves a big \u201chole\u201d which causes the new facility to locate nearby because there is a significant market share to be captured in that region once facility 6 goes out of business. Consequently, for all nine values of n, the optimistic location is obtained when facility j = 6 goes out of business.\nThe results for the minimax regret problem are reported in Table 4. For each number of demand points, we report the minimax regret optimal location X\u0302, and the regret value at this location. Note that there are only 9 instances because all values of j are incorporated in the objective function. We also report which of the 11 states of the world, j, had the maximum regret, and the captured market share Mj(X\u0302) at the minimax regret location. We compare it with Mj(Xj) which is the maximum possible market share when facility j fails, which is also reported in Table 3. Note that the regret value is Mj(Xj) \u2212Mj(X\u0302). Run times are very short because UB2(j) is applied. Since these values need to be calculated for each state of the world rather than only one state of the world, calculating each value of the objective function or the upper bound takes about 11 times longer than calculating them for a single state of the world reported in tables 2 and 3. However, the total number of squares is 6,529 compared with 8,113 in Table 2, and the effort for managing the list of squares is lower.\nIn Table 5, the results for the expected value criterion are reported for \u03c00 = 0.0, 0.1, . . . , 1.0.\nFor each value of \u03c00 we assumed equal probabilities for each facility failing and applied \u03c0j = 1\u2212\u03c00 p for j = 1, . . . , p. Run times are very short so we opted not to report them. All 99 instances were solved in a total time of 17.83 seconds which is an average of 0.18 seconds per instance with a maximum time of 0.66 seconds which means that each of the 99 instances was solved in no more\nthan 0.66 seconds. The optimal locations for the facilities do not change by much as \u03c00 increases. For \u03c00 = 1 no facility fails and the location is at the j = 0 location which is the pessimistic location. The trajectory of the locations for n = 20, 000 is depicted in Figure 1 and since it is so short, it is shown only in the zoom-in figure on the right side."

            "text": "We investigated the competitive facility location problem which is finding the best location of a new competing facility among a set of existing facilities that maximizes the market share captured by the new facility. There exists uncertainty about the future of existing facilities. It is possible that one of the existing competing facilities will go out of business. We find the best location for a new facility which protects against such a possibility. Four commonly used decision rules (optimistic, pessimistic, minimax regret, and expected value) are analyzed and optimally solved within a given relative accuracy by a specially designed branch and bound algorithm based on the Big Square Small Square procedure (Hansen et al., 1981).\nSpecial upper bounds that are needed for the branch and bound procedure are designed. Upper bounds based on the same idea may assist in developing upper bounds for other optimization problems. Results of extensive computational experiments are reported and analyzed. The largest instance of 10 existing competing facilities and 20,000 demand points was solved in less than one second of computer time by each of the four decision criteria. As future research we propose to model similar possible scenarios for other models, and apply the proposed techniques (such as the upper bounds) proposed in this paper."
