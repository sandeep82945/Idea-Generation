    "abstractText": "H1.6Mn1.6O4 lithium-ion screen adsorbents were synthesized by soft chemical synthesis and solid phase calcination and then applied to the recovery of metal Li and Co from waste cathode materials of a lithium cobalt oxide-based battery. The leaching experiments of cobalt and lithium from cathode materials by a citrate hydrogen peroxide system and tartaric acid system were investigated. The experimental results showed that under the citrate hydrogen peroxide system, when the temperature was 90 \u25e6C, the rotation speed was 600 r\u00b7min\u22121 and the solid\u2013liquid ratio was 10 g\u00b71 L\u22121, the leaching rate of Co and Li could reach 86.21% and 96.9%, respectively. Under the tartaric acid system, the leaching rates of Co and Li were 90.34% and 92.47%, respectively, under the previous operating conditions. The adsorption results of the lithium-ion screen showed that the adsorbents were highly selective for Li+, and the maximum adsorption capacities were 38.05 mg\u00b7g\u22121. In the process of lithium removal, the dissolution rate of lithium was about 91%, and the results of multiple cycles showed that the stability of the adsorbent was high. The recovery results showed that the purity of LiCl, Li2CO3 and CoCl2 crystals could reach 93%, 99.59% and 87.9%, respectively. LiCoO2 was regenerated by the sol\u2013gel method. XRD results showed that the regenerated LiCoO2 had the advantages of higher crystallinity and less impurity.",

The main recovery methods are pyrometallurgy [2] and hydrometallurgy [3]: (1) the first process was simple, but it had the disadvantages of high energy consumption, complex temperature control and easy-to-produce harmful dust and gas; (2) the second process had a high recovery rate of valuable metals and high purity of products, which is the mainstream technology of waste lithium-ion battery recovery at present. The wet process was mainly acid leaching, in which metal ions were dissolved by acid and then selectively recovered from metals such as lithium and cobalt. Among them, common acids could be divided into inorganic acids and organic acids. Inorganic acids were usually hydrochloric acid [4], nitric acid [5], sulfuric acid [6], etc. The above strong acids were used to destroy the structure of positive electrode materials and achieved the purpose of recycling. However, strong inorganic acids had defects, such as corroding machinery and producing waste gas and wastewater. On\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3737. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28093737 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3737 2 of 15\nthe contrary, organic acids had mild acidity, little corrosion and were easy to decompose, so they had an excellent performance as leaching agents [7]. In addition, some alkaline leaching processes were used to recover aluminum in batteries [8]. For metal ions after leaching, the precipitation method [9], solvent extraction method [10] and other methods are usually used for separation. Due to the many separation steps and difficult separation, the applicability was poor. Among the treatment methods of heavy metal pollution in water, the adsorption method was often used. For example, microplastics [11] and chitosan [12] had a strong adsorption capacity for metal ions. At present, there is little research on metal ion separation by the adsorption method, the reason being that the common adsorbents often could not adsorb a single metal ion alone. A MnO2\u00b70.5H2O lithium-ion sieve obtained by elution of a Li1.6Mn1.6O4 precursor is currently the adsorbent with the largest adsorption capacity of lithium ions [13]. Moreover, the Li-ion sieve was highly selective in the adsorption of Li+, which provided a possibility for the adsorption method to be applied to the separation of lithium in lithium cobaltate batteries. In this study, citric acid and tartaric acid in organic acids were selected as acids in the leaching agent, and the leaching experiment was carried out on the waste cathode material of a lithium cobalt oxide-based battery. A lithium-ion screen with selective adsorption capacity was used to adsorb, separate and recover Li+ from the leaching solution. Two routes were tested for cobalt recovery: one was to reprecipitate to form cobalt chloride crystals, and the other was to use recycled lithium as a lithium source to regenerate lithium cobaltate."

Powder Parameters of Cathode Material\nThe material came from the cathode material of a waste lithium cobalt oxide-based battery, which was mainly composed of lithium cobaltate. During the disassembly process, the aluminum shell was manually removed to fully remove the attached organic plastics and adhesives. The element composition of the cathode material was determined, as shown in Table 1. The main metals were 60.2% Co and 7.2% Li, respectively, while other metal elements such as Fe, Al and Ni were all lower than 1%. Lithium cobalt oxide-based batteries on the market might also contain Na, Cu, Zn and other elements, which were not detected in the powder.\nThe leaching efficiency of the valuable metals was affected by many factors, such as leaching acid concentration, H2O2 concentration, temperature, rotational speed and reaction time. To control these factors, the authors conducted a lot of exploration, which referred to other studies in the literature [14\u201317]. So, in this study, the temperature was determined to be 90 \u25e6C, and the rotation speed was 600 r\u00b7min\u22121. With the increase in reaction time, the metal leaching efficiency in the cathode material is shown in Figure 1, where the leaching rates of Co and Li reached the highest of 86.21% and 96.9% around 4 h (Figure 1a). Then, the data were fitted according to the control velocity equation of the chemical reaction (Figure 1b), where X is the leaching efficiency (%) and t is the leaching time (min). The determination coefficients R2 of Co and Li fitting curves were 0.95334 and 0.99447, both above 0.95, indicating a high degree of fitting; that is, metal leaching was controlled by chemical reaction.\nt(min)\nt(min)\nFigure 1.

The influence of the pH;\nAs 0.5 mol\u00b7L\u22121 HCl was used as eluent, the recovered lithium solution became acidic (pH 0~1). The formation pH of Li2CO3 crystal was determined by many experiments to be about 8~9, so the solution pH could be adjusted by adding an appropriate amount of NaOH before the reaction to promote the formation of Li2CO3 crystals. Figure 10 shows a comparison of the quality and purity of the final product when 10 mL of a 30 g\u00b7L\u22121 Na2CO3 solution was added to 100 mL of leachate at different pH values (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12). It can be seen that as the pH of the initial solution rose, the crystal yield of Li2CO3 gradually increased because a small amount of Na2CO3 reacted with H+ when the solution was acidic. The purity of the product tended to rise at the beginning. The closer the pH was to 9, the easier Na2CO3 would react to form crystals. When the pH exceeded 9, the purity began to decline. Therefore, the pH of the recovered lithium solution could be adjusted to 7~9, which is conducive to the generation of high quality Li2CO3 crystals.\nlec les 3, 2 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 f 6\n. s 0.5 ol\u00b7L\u22121 HCl was used as eluent, the recovered lithiu solution beca e acidic (p 0~1). he for ation pH of Li2CO3 crystal was determined by many experiments to be about 8~9, so the solution pH could be adjusted by adding a a r riate a t f f r t r cti t r t t f r ti f i2CO3 crystals.

Other parameters were fixed unchanged, and the experiment was conducted; the results are shown in Figure 11. As seen in Figure 11, with the increase in the dosage of Na2CO3, more crystals of Li2CO3 can be obtained. When the dosage of Na2CO3 was greater than 15 mL, without regard to the loss in the filtration process, the mass increase of the obtained Li2CO3 crystals was small because the Li in the eluent had almost completely formed precipitate. However, the crystallization purity of Li2CO3 tended to decrease slightly with the increase of the dosage of Na2CO3 because a small amount of sodium carbonate was wrapped in the Li2CO3 crystal during the crystallization process [26].\nFigure 10.

The former avoided the use of a large number of chemical reagents but added th steps f vacuum-drying and high-temperature calcination. The latter was simpler to operate but used more chemical reagents.\n2.4.1. Regeneration of Lithium Cobalt Oxide-Based Battery by Soft Chemical Method\nThe element concentration ratio was adjusted t 1:1 according to the concentration of Co2+ in the leaching solution. The corresponding lithium chloride crystals obtained in the above steps were added to the leaching solution as lithium sources; then, the pH of the leaching solution was adjusted to 7 with ammonia. Firstly, this was placed in a water bath\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3737 11 of 15\nkettle at 80 \u25e6C, then magnetically stirred for about 2 h at 200 r\u00b7min\u22121 until the formation of sol. Subsequently, the sol formed a dry gel through vacuum drying for 24 h, and then the calcination was carried out by a tubular furnace at 700 \u25e6C temperature to obtain the regenerated LiCoO2 crystal. The calcination temperature had a great influence on the performance and structure of the regenerated LiCoO2. In summary of the studies [27\u201329], when the temperature was 500 \u25e6C, the regenerated LiCoO2 was mostly a spinel structure, and when it rose to between 700 \u25e6C and 900 \u25e6C, the regenerated LiCoO2 was a hexagonal phase structure. With the increase in temperature, the peak strength would gradually increase and the crystallinity would increase. However, when the temperature exceeded 900 \u25e6C, lithium ions would gradually come out and decompose to produce Co3O4.

The former avoided the use of a large number of chemical reagents but added the steps of vacuum-drying and high-temperature calcination. The latter was simpler to operate but used more chemical reagents."

            "text": "The element concentration ratio was adjusted to 1:1 according to the concentration of Co2+ in the leaching solution. The corresponding lithium chloride crystals obtained in the above steps were added to the leaching solution as lithium sources; then, the pH of the leaching solution was adjusted to 7 with ammonia. Firstly, this was placed in a water bath kettle at 80 \u00b0C, then magnetically stirred for about 2 h at 200 r\u00b7min\u22121 until the formation of sol. Subsequently, the sol formed a dry gel through vacuum drying for 24 h, and then the calcination was carried out by a tubular furnace at 700 \u00b0C temperature to obtain the regenerated LiCoO2 crystal. The calcination temperature had a great influence on the performance and structure of the regenerated LiCoO2. In summary of the studies [27\u201329], when the temperature was 500 \u00b0C, the regenerated LiCoO2 was mostly a spinel structure, and when it rose to between 700 \u00b0C and 900 \u00b0C, the regenerated LiCoO2 was a hexagonal phase structure. With the increase in temperature, the peak strength would gradually increase and the crystallinity would increase. However, when the temperature exceeded 900 \u00b0C, lithium ions would gradually come out and decompose to produce Co3O4. Therefore, this study chose the calcination condition at 700 \u00b0C for 5 h to obtain regenerated LiCoO2 particles. Phase analysis by XRD showed that the position of the diffraction peak was consistent with that of the standard card (PDF#74-1972), with the characteristic diffraction peaks of (003), (101) and (104), except that there were two LiCoO2 characteristic peaks of hexagonal layered structures (018) and (110) [28,29], indicating that LiCoO2 material with a better structure was obtained using the sol\u2013gel method (Figure 13).

The beaker was placed in a water bath kettle at the temperature of 90 \u25e6C and a rotating speed of 600 r\u00b7min\u22121.

The leaching rates of 86.21% and 96.9% for Co and Li can be achieved at a reaction temperature of 90 \u25e6C, stirring speed of 600 r\u00b7min\u22121 and a solid\u2013liquid ratio of 10 g\u00b71 L\u22121. The determination coefficients R2 of Co and Li fitting curves were 0.95334 and 0.99447 according to the chemical reaction control velocity equation, indicating that leaching was a chemical reaction. In the tartaric acid system, the leaching rates of Co and Li were 90.34% and 92.47%. The leaching of Li in the tartaric acid system was rapid, reaching 75.29% in the first 30 min; 2. The prepared Li1.6Mn1.6O4 lithium-ion screen was used to conduct the lithium separation. The maximum adsorption capacity of the lithium screen was 38.05 mg\u00b7g\u22121, and the dissolution rate of lithium was about 91%. Through elution, purification and other steps, the adsorbed lithium was transformed into a lithium chloride solution. There were two methods for lithium recovery: (1) Relatively pure lithium chloride crystals can be obtained by direct concentration and crystallization, with a detected purity up to 93%. (2) Li2CO3 crystals were generated by adding Na2CO3, and the purity of Li2CO3 crystals can reach 99.59%; 3. Two methods were used to conduct the tests for the recovery of cobalt: (1) CoCl2 crystals were obtained by means of reprecipitation and recrystallization, and the purity can reach 87.9%; (2) LiCoO2 was directly regenerated using the sol\u2013gel method and lithium chloride was used as a lithium source. XRD characterization showed that LiCoO2 had good crystallinity. The two methods had different advantages and disadvantages: the former was simpler to operate, and the latter used fewer chemical reagents. The above two methods could provide ideas for recycling waste cathode materials of lithium cobalt oxide-based batteries.\nAuthor Contributions: H.W.: Conceptualization, Methodology, Data Curation, Writing\u2014Original draft preparation; G.C.: Supervision, Reviewing and Editing, Funding acquisition; L.M., G.W., X.D. and R.C.: Resources, Formal analysis, Project administration, Participation in discussions and suggestions.
