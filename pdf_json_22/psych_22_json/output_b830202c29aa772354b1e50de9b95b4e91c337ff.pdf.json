    "abstractText": "Mindfulness is assumed to foster the ability to consistently act in line with one\u2019s authentic self; a skill which has been found to enhance students\u2019 autonomous motivated behavior in the educational context. However, evidence regarding how mindfulness can be integrated into existing conceptual frameworks such as the trans-contextual model is scarce. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the role of mindfulness in students\u2019 autonomous motivation in the school and leisure time contexts. Overall, N = 1877 students (M = 14.74 years, SD = 2.63) indicated their selfreported mindfulness, their perceived need for support in physical education, their autonomous motivation during physical education and leisure time, as well as their perceived behavioral control, attitude, subjective norm, and intention toward physical activity. Physical activity was additionally measured physiologically for n = 240 students using accelerometers. Path model analyses revealed that the inclusion of mindfulness substantially improved the trans-contextual model fit. Perceived autonomy support positively predicted mindfulness, which, in turn, predicted autonomous motivation in physical education and leisure time, attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed the significant indirect effects of mindfulness on physiological and self-reported physical activity. Based on these results, mindfulness can be considered a key factor in fostering students\u2019 motivation to become physically active.",

The trans-contextual model [1] addresses this transfer by characterizing the processes of autonomous motivation in school as an important factor of behavioral engagement over a longer period, which, in turn, predicts autonomous motivation beyond the school context. The introduced model entails a multi-theoretical approach, combining self-determination theory (SDT) [2], Vallerand\u2019s [3] hierarchical model of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) [4]. In accordance with SDT, the first key assumption of the trans-contextual model is that an autonomy supportive climate in class is associated with a greater perception of autonomous (self-determined) motivation in class [5]. Second, the authors propose that autonomous motivation toward leisure-time-based physical activities is predicted by autonomous motivation in physical education. In addition, autonomous motivation in an out-of-school context predicts the attitude, self-perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms toward physical activity, which, in turn, predict intentions toward, and actual engagement in, out-of-school physical activity. Overall, the presented model displays an important framework for fostering an\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

            "text": "As a key aspect of the trans-contextual model, SDT is an empirically driven theory of human motivation and development, treating motivation on a continuum of behavioral regulation [7]. Differentiating between controlled (more externally regulated forms of motivation) and autonomous motivation (more self-determined regulations of motivation), the transition from a more controlled toward a self-reflective behavior integrated into one\u2019s self is called \u201cinternalization\u201d [8]. Regarding autonomous motivation, which reflects engaging in a behavior for reasons of volition to obtain self-referenced outcomes, three different regulation types are presented in SDT [7]. Firstly, identified regulation reflects the engagement in a behavior, which serves as a purpose for a self-endorsed outcome, which is personally important. Secondly, integrated regulation, a more self-regulated form along the continuum of SDT, occurs when identified regulations are entirely assimilated to the self (internalized), meaning that the personally important values of the behavioral outcomes are fully integrated into the sense of self. Finally, intrinsic motivation, the most self-determined (autonomous) behavioral regulation form, represents the engagement in an activity for the intrinsic (inherent) satisfaction and enjoyment of the activity itself. In contrast, two controlled types of motivation are described in SDT. As such, external regulation reflects the most controlled form of behaviors, relying entirely on external drivers, such as the receipt of a reward or the avoidance of punishment. Finally, introjected regulation describes a more internalized but still externally pressured behavioral regulation, undertaken in order to avoid possible feelings of shame or guilt when not executing the behavior. Internalized (i.e., autonomous) regulated forms of motivation have been found to be associated with the continuance of self-determined learning and activities in school, which lead to various positive outcomes, such as academic attainment, performance, knowledge, psychological well-being, and happiness [9\u201311]. In order to facilitate the \u201cinternalization\u201d of autonomous motivation, SDT proposes the three innate psychological needs for autonomy (the sense of being the causal agent of one\u2019s own behavior), competence (the sense of being capable to master a desired behavior), and relatedness (the sense of being connected and attached to significant others) [8]. According to existing research in the educational context, the support of these needs by the physical education teacher ameliorated their students\u2019 satisfaction of their needs, which was found to be directly related to a more internally motivated regulation [12\u201314]. Thus, in extension to the first assumption of the transcontextual model, we assume that it is not autonomy support alone, which plays a role in predicting autonomous motivation in physical education. Instead, we expect competence and relatedness support to be further significant predictors of autonomous motivation, as proposed by SDT. With regard to Vallerand\u2019s hierarchical model of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation [3], it is claimed that similar motivational types are interrelated between different contexts, and on the hierarchical level, towards similar global, as well as situational, motivation types. Hagger and colleagues [1] therefore assumed, and confirmed that, in their trans-contextual model, students\u2019 autonomous motivation in the physical education context was related to their autonomous motivation level for leisure-time-based physical activity."

            "text": "As a further assumption of the trans-contextual model, self-regulated behavior (i.e., autonomous motivation) influences the intention to become physically active, and is mediated by the proposed constructs of the theory of planned behavior toward a specific behavior [4]. The theory of planned behavior posits that human behavior is guided by three separable components reflecting beliefs about self-efficacy. Firstly, beliefs of the consequences or attributes of the behavior refer to a favorable or unfavorable attitude toward the behavior. Secondly, beliefs about factors that may promote or hinder performing the\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12999 3 of 19\nbehavior are called perceived behavioral control, which could be used as a measure for the actual control of the behavior in question (i.e., if people are realistic in their judgments of behavior difficulty) [15]. Thirdly, beliefs about the normative expectations of others may result in social pressure or subjective norms, which further influence the intention to carry out the behavior. Intention, that is, the willingness to engage in a behavior, has been found to be the immediate antecedent of behavior, formed by the three components of attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms [16]. The theory of planned behavior has been supported in several recent empirical endeavors from a variety of scientific domains, including health behavior [17] and teaching in education [18], or, more specifically, physical activity [19]. However, meta-analyses revealed that, on average, intentions explain no more than 30% of subsequent behaviors [20,21]. This so-called intention\u2013behavior gap in predicting behavior [22], could be extenuated by additionally improving memory, and by creating habits and automatic processes to initiate behavior [23\u201326]."

            "heading": "1.3. Conceptual Integration of Mindfulness into the Trans-Contextual Model",
            "text": "Although the trans-contextual model demonstrates robust theoretical and scientific evidence, it is restricted to the implication of a need-supportive climate in class to promote autonomous motivation in the long term [1,5]. Therefore, in the present study, another important mental state, namely mindfulness, is evaluated, as it may influence said motivational promotion, alongside the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs in class. As described in the work of Kabat-Zinn [27,28], mindfulness can be defined as a nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment with all senses. It is specified as the practice of consciously bringing back one\u2019s attention to the \u201chere and now\u201d. Mindfulness has been proven to provide a climate of reduced stress [29], and improves well-being [30] and engagement in class [31], thus representing a promising concept to be considered in the educational context. As such, the advantages of implementing mindfulness in education have been demonstrated in numerous studies on evidence-based programs aimed at boosting social competent behaviors, more positive self-concept, optimism [32], improvements in working memory, attention, academic skills, emotional regulation [33], moral reasoning, and ethical decision making [34], in both elementary and high school [35]. In the context of SDT, awareness is furthermore viewed as a significant component of self-regulated behavior and well-being [36]. Overall, the question of whether higher self-reported mindfulness and behavioral self-regulation in school have an impact on related out-of-school physical activity is of considerable importance. This is especially relevant as only around 30% of adolescents across 146 countries reach the recommended World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines of being physically active for at least 60 min a day [37]. Although mindfulness programs and practices in education have provided promising results, there appears to be considerable heterogeneity with regard to their significance, acceptance, and theoretical background in existing research [38]. Additionally, the authors state that such programs are often based on exploratory non-consensus frameworks with few replication studies. Thus, more research is needed in order to establish a profound school-based framework for interventions in educational contexts incorporating mindfulness. In this study, we wish to address this issue by investigating the relationship between mindfulness and mechanisms whose educational relevance has already been established; more specifically, to the different constructs of the trans-contextual model [1]. When considering the significant role of mindfulness within the school context, we expect autonomy support of the physical education teacher to play a key role in predicting mindfulness. Furthermore, we assume autonomy support to be related to autonomous motivation and mindfulness. For instance, if the physical education teacher encourages students to take control of their own actions (e.g., choosing the adequate exercise matching one\u2019s performance ability), this fulfillment of their need for autonomy may not only lead to a higher perception of agency [39], but also to increased self-awareness [40]. Consequently, we suspect that students\u2019 increased self-awareness and perceived autonomy may inherently\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12999 4 of 19\nincrease their perceived overall mindfulness, leading to behaviors that are congruent with their own experienced self. Furthermore, as self-regulation requires explicit awareness [41], and as SDT treats awareness as an essential aspect for the internalization of a self-determined regulation, we additionally assume that mindfulness is directly related to autonomous motivation. For example, while integrated regulation represents a form of highly autonomous motivation, it requires self-reflection and the awareness to recognize if one\u2019s own values and needs reflect one\u2019s actions [8]. Thus, mindfulness functions as a prerequisite to the awareness of whether one is consistently acting with one\u2019s authentic self [42] by being aware of external circumstances, which may affect personal regulatory processes [43]. In their meta-analysis, Donald and colleagues [44] obtained scientific evidence for this relationship, in the sense that mindfulness was directly associated to intrinsic motivation and identified regulation. Even if the conceptual alliance between SDT and mindfulness is substantial, available scientific evidence with regard to how mindfulness may be integrated into the mechanisms of SDT is scarce and generally lacking in the trans-contextual model. So far, existing research has been limited to findings showing that awareness is related to self-regulation and mindfulness, and, in turn, that self-reported mindfulness is associated with autonomous, self-regulated behavior [44\u201346]. Given the promising nature of mindfulness in extending SDT, the present study investigates how mindfulness complements the mechanisms of the trans-contextual model. We therefore assume that the support of autonomy by the physical education teacher in class will positively affect students\u2019 self-reported mindfulness, which, in turn, will positively affect their autonomous motivation (i.e., intrinsic motivation and identified regulation) in both physical education and leisure-time-based physical activity. As a particularity of the trans-contextual model, it has furthermore been found that an increased autonomous motivation toward physical activity in leisure time is directly related to subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and attitude [1]. In accordance with these findings, awareness, attention, and autonomous motivation are considered crucial for an individual to monitor inner experiences and environmental factors in order to evaluate the current situation as it is experienced [42]. In this sense, it is expected that mindfulness might be directly related to the three antecedents of the intention to become physically active, as proposed by the theory of planned behavior. Importantly, the underlying concept of mindfulness considers awareness only independently of the contents of the mind [47]. In contrast, however, the TPB suggests that attitudes are crucial for the formation of a behavioral intention, which denotes a mental state comprising moods, associations, expectations, and intentions. In contrast to Western academic psychological definitions of mindfulness, including attitude [48], we agree with Mikulas [47] that this addition could lead to confusion in the understanding and application of mindfulness, as the concept of mindfulness primarily considers a non-judgmental awareness in a given situation. In this sense, we believe that the concepts of attitudes and mindfulness should be treated as distinct entities. Therefore, we assume that mindfulness has an impact on attitudes with regard to social behavior. For example, Langer and colleagues [49] found that sixth graders without disabilities who participated in mindfulness training showed higher attendance rates and increased teammate choices of children with disabilities. Objective self-awareness (e.g., self-awareness promoted through manipulations such as mirrors or TV cameras), has additionally been found to be relevant for attitude\u2013behavior consistency [50]. Similarly, according to the concept of perceived behavioral control, Pagnini and colleagues [51] propose a framework to include mindfulness, as both concepts have similar positive outcomes on physical health and psychological well-being. When individuals are aware of their current situation, they can adapt to changes more quickly, resulting in experiencing control. In their experimentally created mindfulness-inducing Rejection Behavioral Monitoring Technique, Perlmuter and Langer [52] furthermore found that control could be effectively enhanced through focusing on rejected alternatives related to a specific\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12999 5 of 19\nactivity. Accordingly, mindfulness has been found to positively affect perceived behavioral control [41,53]. In contrast to perceived behavioral control and attitudes, research on the conceptual integration of mindfulness to subjective norms is scarce. However, it has been found that mindfulness is positively associated with expressing oneself in social situations through engaging in empathic behavior, while at the same time leading to a decrease in social anxiety [54]. Furthermore, mindfulness-based interventions improve prosocial responding in both adults [55] and adolescents [56]. Thus, it is expected that mindfulness will be related to the students\u2019 perception of subjective norms due to an increased awareness. Moreover, mindfulness has been found to moderate the relationship between intention and physical activity in leisure time [57]. For instance, more mindful individuals were better able to control the influences of counter-intentional habits and thoughts, perhaps due to higher attention and awareness of their inner experiences and routines [57]. Therefore, an indirect effect of mindfulness on intention and behavior is expected in the presented study. As a particularity of the present study, it needs to be stressed that it is unique in conceptually integrating mindfulness into the trans-contextual model. At the same time, this study also represents an attempt to test the trans-contextual model on both selfreported physical activity behavior and physiologically measured physical activity via accelerometers. As self-report and physiological measures on physical activity show low to moderate correlation values, it is of particular interest to include and compare the results from both of these instruments of measurement [58]."

As mindfulness-based intervention programs have proven beneficial for students in class [35], and as the trans-contextual model provides evidence for a better understanding of the contextual transfer of self-regulated behavior [5], we assume that integrating mindfulness will provide an important conceptual benefit for the trans-contextual model. Specifically, we expect that the support of autonomy by the physical education teacher predicts mindfulness, while, at the same time, mindfulness should positively predict autonomous motivation in physical education and leisure time. Additionally, we hypothesize that mindfulness is positively related to attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Finally, mindfulness is suspected to be indirectly related to intention and both to self-reported and physiologically measured physical activity behavior, mediated by attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control."

Due to this digital testing approach, no missing data need to be reported, because the students were unable to complete the questionnaire if they had missed an item. The duration of questionnaire completion varied between 30 and 50 min, depending on the age of the students. All students whose physical activity was additionally measured physiologically, individually received detailed information about the accelerometer by trained personnel at school and during a school lesson. Each accelerometer was previously initialized at a 30 HZ frequency. Students were instructed to wear the accelerometer on the right hip for seven consecutive days. They were told to wear the accelerometer anytime while being awake, except for water-based activities. Additionally, participants\u2019 height and weight were measured to further analyze the physical activity rates. After one week, the accelerometers were returned in class and potential ambiguities were clarified. All participants signed informed consent forms. Additional written permission was required from the legal representative of the participants younger than 16 years. Ethical approval was provided by the Ethics Review Panel of the University of Luxembourg."

In this sense, the aim of the present study was to verify if mindfulness, a concept which was found to be beneficial in education [38] can be conceptually integrated in the trans-contextual model, given the existing indications that mindfulness is related to the respective individual concepts of the model [44].

            "text": "Overall, our findings were in line with the assumptions of the trans-contextual model (please refer to Model 1a). However, in extension to the postulation that autonomy support directly influences autonomous motivation in physical education, we obtained mixed findings. In Model 1a, without mindfulness, we found competence support as well as autonomy support to exert a positive and significant direct influence, while the contribution of relatedness support was statistically insignificant. In line with the findings of Hagger and Chatzisarantis [5], autonomy support (e.g., enabling the students to choose an activity) proved to be important in the educational context in order to promote students\u2019 autonomous motivation (Model 1a and 1b). However, in Model 2b (including mindfulness and physiological physical activity), the relationship between autonomy support and autonomous motivation remained statistically insignificant. On the other hand, and in congruence with Kiemer and colleagues [79], we found that competence support (e.g., providing individual goals) served as an important predictor for students\u2019 autonomous motivation in school throughout all statistical models. The relationship between competence support and autonomous motivation was consistently statistically significant in all models with higher standardized path coefficients than autonomy support. Furthermore, we were able to replicate the trans-contextual path between autonomous motivation in physical education and out-of-school autonomous motivation in leisure time. These results confirm that motivational regulation is transferable toward similar activities in different contexts [3]. Additionally, these findings highlight the importance of the motivational climate in the educational context, as teachers\u2019 encouragement toward enhancing students\u2019 autonomous motivation during physical education is likely to persist in leisure over time [6]. When specifically considering the association between mindfulness and basic need support, as well as the one between mindfulness and motivation, we found that solely students\u2019 perceived autonomy support of the physical education teacher was positively related to their self-reported mindfulness. In this sense, we provided the first scientific indications that autonomy support is not only important to enhance the internalization of a behavior, thereby promoting autonomous behavior, but that the perceived autonomy support by the teacher is also positively related to mindfulness in students. This relationship was even found to transcend the path between autonomy support and autonomous motivation in physical education when referring to Model 2b, where physical activity was measured physiologically. Thus, mindfulness served as a full mediator between autonomy support and autonomous motivation. These results imply that teachers who enhance the autonomy of students\u2019 self-regulated behavior, for instance by providing a choice of activities or encouraging them to ask questions, and ensuring they understand the goals of a given exercise, will foster students\u2019 everyday life awareness that is, overall, non-judgmental (i.e., demonstrates mindfulness) [43]. In turn, higher mindfulness levels were found to be positively associated with the autonomous motivation of students not only in the context of physical education, but also for leisure time. The present results therefore confirm our assumption that a greater awareness of one\u2019s values and goals will positively affect mindfulness to engage in autonomously motivated behaviors through the fulfillment of one\u2019s need for autonomy. In this sense, mindfulness may promote engagement in self-regulated behaviors, that is, behavior that is congruent with one\u2019s \u2018true self\u2019 and values (i.e., an autonomously motivated behavior) [42]. Thus, our results further underline the importance of promoting mindfulness in physical education, particularly in order to strengthen students\u2019 awareness of their own values and goals to foster their internalization of behavior [80]. Interestingly, students\u2019 perceived competence and relatedness support from the physical education teacher were not directly related to perceived mindfulness. As the support of both relatedness (i.e., fostering a feeling of respect and kindness) and competence significantly correlated with mindfulness (see Table 1), we infer that, in light of the transcontextual model, our results further underline the key importance of autonomy for be-\nInt.

Moreover, competence support seems to be a key factor in directly improving autonomous motivation, irrespective of mindfulness. In other words, competence support may foster autonomous regulation, but it may not necessarily increase students\u2019 overall awareness of non-judgmentally being present in the moment."

Put differently, autonomous motivation had a positive impact on the crucial components for the formation of a behavioral intention. Regarding the influence of autonomous motivation on subjective norm, we obtained mixed findings. In Model 1a and 1b, a small but significant positive effect was found. It needs to be stated that there is a disagreement in the scientific literature, as some scholars do not presume an association between the perceived subjective norm, representing a concept of social pressures, and autonomous motivation [81]. In contrast, several studies have presented evidence for a significant positive path between these two constructs [5]. The positive relationship between autonomous motivation and subjective norm found in some of our models might be interpreted as the respect or recognition of the wishes of the significant others as supportive or in accordance with self-endorsed values.

With regard to the inclusion of mindfulness, our assumptions were met. Mindfulness was positively related to attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. These results further underline the significant relationship between a higher situational awareness and the formation of an attitude toward a behavior. Notably, self-awareness has already been found to be relevant for achieving attitude\u2013behavior consistency [50]. Similarly, mindfulness was positively related to perceived behavioral control. Apparently, if people are aware of their current situation, they may adapt to changes or challenges more quickly, leading to an experience of control [51]. Furthermore, our results support the assumption that mindfulness would be positively associated to subjective norm. In this sense, a greater overall awareness is likely to simultaneously increase the awareness of social norms and/or the pressures of significant others [54], which may eventually lead to prosocial responding [56]. Additionally, our assumption that mindfulness would neither directly affect intention nor actual behavior [57] could be confirmed. Our results indicate that the serial mediation paths of mindfulness on attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm on intention, and, finally, on actual physical activity behavior, were significant. A particular strength of the present study is the fact that our assumptions were not only met for the self-reported measure of physical activity, but also for physiologically measured physical activity. As expected, self-reported and physiologically measured physical activity generally did not correlate to a great extent (r = .31 in our study; comparable to the results of Hagstromer and colleagues [58]), especially when considering that both variables were measuring the same construct. Nevertheless, our proposed model including mindfulness into the trans-contextual model could be confirmed for both constructs, which further strengthens the trans-contextual model. As our mindfulness-including Models 1b and 2b revealed an improved overall model fit, compared to their counterparts without mindfulness, this further highlights the importance of our suggestion to take into account the beneficial role of mindfulness in the educational context.\nInt.

As the process of internalizing a healthy behavioral regulation requires cognitive mechanisms such as, for example, awareness [43], the present results underline that mindfulness is directly related to autonomous motivation. In this sense, a non-judgmental awareness of the present moment may increase a more objective view of one\u2019s own behavior and values, which, through self-reflection, helps to bring values and needs into congruence with one\u2019s actual behavior. Thus, mindfulness is crucial in order to be aware if one is consistently acting with one\u2019s authentic self [43]. In sum, based on our overarching conceptual findings that mindfulness is related to motivation both in school and beyond the educational setting, this specifically stresses our recommendation to implement such interventions aimed at fostering mindfulness in schools on a large scale. With regard to practical examples for implementing mindfulness in education, as described, for instance, in Saltzman and Goldin [82], adequate mindfulness exercises (e.g., breathing exercises, the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise, a short a priori mindfulness reflection on \u201cwhat is my personal goal for today?\u201d, or body scan, etc.), ought to be made available to students, as they result in increased mindfulness rates, while simultaneously being experienced as meaningful for their everyday life. Ultimately, mindfulness-based interventions in schools represent promising tools, particularly for improving cognitive performance as well as students\u2019 resilience in the face of stress [38]."

            "text": "One limitation of the present study is that, at the time of the data collection period, no questionnaire to assess the students\u2019 three distinct constructs of basic need support had been empirically validated and published. However, we found good psychometric properties using and adapting the scales by Standage and colleagues [62]. In relation to this, in the present extensive study, the number of items for each scale was considerably low. Nevertheless, all scales showed a good reliability and a larger questionnaire would have been unreasonably time consuming for the children, and difficult to complete in one session. With regard to the mindfulness scale, the FMI [67] was used. However, it needs to be noted that, usually, the Mindfulness and Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) [42] has been used in order to analyze the relationship between autonomous motivation and mindfulness. The MAAS differs from the FMI insofar as it focuses solely on (self-) attention and awareness, with exclusively negatively formulated \u201cmindlessness\u201d items (e.g., \u201cI rush through activities without being really attentive to them\u201d) [83]. The FMI is, similar to the MAAS, a unidimensional scale. However, it includes a more Buddhistic approach to measuring mindfulness, thereby exceeding the MAAS in the aspects of \u201cnon-judgement, accepting attitude, dis-identification, insightful understanding, or an attitude of having no specific goals\u201d [67] (p. 1545). Both instruments were found to be reliable and valid [42,83]; however, in order to analyze mindfulness (and not mindlessness) in light of the nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment, the FMI was used in the present study, which proved to be related to autonomous motivation in the physical education and leisure time context. In addition, the complete autonomous motivational regulation scale of SDT [7] could not be addressed. The integrated regulation subscale that represents the most internal motivational regulation of the extrinsic motivation continuum is considered to be very similar to intrinsic motivation, as the internal values of the behavior in question are defined as being completely integrated into the sense of self and wholly volitionally performed [84]. As an integrated motivation form may exert a differentiated role within the trans-contextual model, it should be inclusively measured in future studies. In particular, as integrated regulation requires self-reflection and awareness to integrate personal values [8], mindfulness may play a specific role regarding this motivational regulation type. However, to the best\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12999 15 of 19\nknowledge of the authors, the scale in question had not yet been empirically validated for the physical education context at the time of data collection. A further limitation of the present study and suggestion for future research would be to investigate an extension of the trans-contextual model beyond the context of physical education, in order to verify the impact of mindfulness at a more general educational level. Finally, as we provide a first indication that mindfulness can be integrated into the trans-contextual model, we suggest that upcoming research should focus on longitudinal or intervention studies in education, in order to confirm the supposed directions of the path models."

            "text": "In conclusion, we obtained profound scientific results indicating that mindfulness is applicable to the trans-contextual model and that it provides an important tool for targeted interventions to be implemented in class. More specifically, mindfulness was significantly predicted by the teacher\u2019s support of autonomy and directly related not only to autonomous motivation in school, but also to the students\u2019 autonomous motivation in leisure time. Furthermore, mindfulness appeared to be directly related to the basic cognitive concepts of the theory of planned behavior, indicating that mindfulness is indirectly related to actual behavior, mediated by the attitude toward the specific behavior, as well as by perceived behavioral control. The present study thereby replicates and extends the findings of the trans-contextual model not only based on self-report measures, but also using physiologically measured physical activity. As mindfulness has proven to be an important extension of this model for both self-reported and physiologically assessed physical activity behavior, we strongly recommend that interventions aimed at fostering students\u2019 mindfulness receive greater attention in educational settings. Ultimately, in coming back to the initial question that addressed the need for education to also exert a significant influence on students\u2019 everyday life health behaviors, our results suggest that mindfulness is an important aspect that substantially extends the trans-contextual model. Thus, mindfulness serves as a promising exemplary competence for the desired further encouragement of knowledge and beneficial skills learned in school to become integral parts of the everyday lives of students.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.H., M.E. and G.S.; methodology, D.H., M.E. and G.S.; software, D.H. and M.E.; validation, D.H., M.E., A.B., A.M. and G.S.; formal analysis, D.H. and M.E.; investigation, D.H.; resources, A.B. and G.S.; data curation, D.H. and M.E.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, D.H.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.H., M.E., A.B., A.M. and G.S.; visualization, D.H.; supervision, A.B., G.S. and A.M.; project administration, A.B. and G.S.; funding acquisition, A.B. and G.S.
