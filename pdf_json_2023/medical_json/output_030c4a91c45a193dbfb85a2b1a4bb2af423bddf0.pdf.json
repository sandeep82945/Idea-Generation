    "abstractText": "Of those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ~ 10% develop the chronic post-viral debilitating condition, long COVID (LC). Although LC is a heterogeneous condition, about half of cases have typical post-viral fatigue with onset and symptoms that are very similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A key question is whether these conditions are closely related. ME/CFS is a post-stressor fatigue condition that arises from multiple triggers. To investigate the pathophysiology of LC, a pilot study of patients (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 5) has used quantitative proteomics to discover changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proteins. A principal component analysis separated all long COVID patients from healthy controls. Analysis of 3131 proteins identified 162 proteins differentially regulated, of which 37 were related to immune functions, and 21 to mitochondrial functions. Markov cluster analysis identified clusters involved in immune system processes, and two aspects of gene expression-spliceosome and transcription. These results were compared with an earlier dataset of 346 differentially regulated proteins in PBMC\u2019s from ME/CFS patients (n = 9) analysed by the same methodology. There were overlapping protein clusters and enriched molecular pathways particularly in immune functions, suggesting the two conditions have similar immune pathophysiology as a prominent feature, and mitochondrial functions involved in energy production were affected in both conditions.",

            "text": "Of those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ~ 10% develop the chronic post-viral debilitating condition, long COVID (LC). Although LC is a heterogeneous condition, about half of cases have typical post-viral fatigue with onset and symptoms that are very similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A key question is whether these conditions are closely related. ME/CFS is a post-stressor fatigue condition that arises from multiple triggers. To investigate the pathophysiology of LC, a pilot study of patients (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 5) has used quantitative proteomics to discover changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proteins. A principal component analysis separated all long COVID patients from healthy controls. Analysis of 3131 proteins identified 162 proteins differentially regulated, of which 37 were related to immune functions, and 21 to mitochondrial functions. Markov cluster analysis identified clusters involved in immune system processes, and two aspects of gene expression-spliceosome and transcription. These results were compared with an earlier dataset of 346 differentially regulated proteins in PBMC\u2019s from ME/CFS patients (n = 9) analysed by the same methodology. There were overlapping protein clusters and enriched molecular pathways particularly in immune functions, suggesting the two conditions have similar immune pathophysiology as a prominent feature, and mitochondrial functions involved in energy production were affected in both conditions.\nInfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in a post-viral condition, long COVID (LC), in a significant proportion (~ 10%) of those affected1. With now over 772 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide as at November 22nd 20232 there will be an estimated ~ 80 million cases of LC. Long COVID is a chronic debilitating disease arising from this unique viral trigger. The diagnosis of LC is made three months from initial infection when the condition persists for more than eight weeks3. Although LC is recognized as heterogeneous, with some patients suffering from ongoing organ damage, at least 50% have a post-viral fatigue condition4,5 with onset and symptoms very similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), the collective term for the post-viral or post-stressor fatigue condition arising from such multiple triggers6. A recent paper has defined four clinical phenotypes amongst LC patients with the ME/CFS-like fatigue condition the dominant phenotype5. Children, adolescents, and adults can all be affected by ME/CFS and LC with impacts including the inability to pursue education, work or normal life activities7,8. In contrast to LC, ME/CFS is diagnosed formally with a clinical case definition if symptoms persist for at least six months9 while LC is diagnosed after three months3, but for most ME/CFS patients diagnosis has been made much later, when their condition has become well established and other illnesses have been eliminated10. For those patients with ongoing ME/CFS, the debilitating condition is lifelong11 with a resulting heavy burden on families and with severe economic and social impacts. For both conditions, symptoms reported are numerous (estimated to be > 100) and the vast majority of those of LC overlay with those of ME/CFS, with only a small number of differences,\nOPEN"

Nevertheless, the key commonest symptoms identified by the WHO when deriving a clinical case definition for LC: fatigue, brain fog (cognitive defects), activity related post exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, pain, and other neurological symptoms are shared with ME/CFS in the most widely accepted clinical case definitions for this condition.\nOnset of several diseases have also been attributed to infection with SARS-CoV-2, such as type 2 diabetes, and dysautonomia, especially postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)4,12. Increasingly, with focus on LC within the first few months of onset some commentators have proposed that if the post-viral fatigue condition of LC patients lasts beyond one year it \u2018becomes\u2019 ME/CFS. The major clinical phenotype of LC with fatigue symptoms may represent either a specific example of ME/CFS facilitated from the single triggering SARS-COV-2 virus in susceptible people and exhibiting the same dysfunctional physiology generally as in ME/CFS patients, or it may exhibit significantly different molecular changes arising from the specific characteristics of the SARSC0V-2 infection. This study aims to explore this question. If there were fewer cases of COVID-19 worldwide, as with the first SARS CoV-1 outbreak in 2003, LC would most likely have been classified as ME/CFS like the other 75 boutique outbreaks of probable viral infections reported since about 193013.\nWe have proposed a model to explain the complex dysfunctional physiology for both ME/CFS and LC14. A key feature is that in susceptible people the normal transitory immune/inflammatory response of the peripheral system to infection or stress does not resolve quickly as in most people but becomes chronic and that leads to a cascade effect, with involvement of the brain and its immune system, and other components of the central nervous system. The disturbed functions of the CNS result in multiple neurological symptoms, and in poor brain regulation of body physiology. A number of studies have documented chronic dysregulation of the immune cell function involving multiple cell types, and cytokines in ME/CFS15\u201321, and now more recently in LC22\u201325. In ME/CFS, multiple disturbances have been reported in the molecular homeostasis of the transcriptomes26\u201328, proteomes29\u201331, and DNA methylomes32\u201336 of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) that include lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, NK cells) and monocytes37, but not as yet in LC.\nThis current study analysed the PBMC proteomes of post-viral fatigue LC patients whose illness had lasted for one year, compared with age/sex matched healthy controls. It aimed to identify specific areas of cellular physiology that were still dysfunctional a year on from the patients\u2019 initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. Groups of proteins involved with the immune response, and gene expression (spliceosome and transcription) and mitochondrial function were shown to be differentially regulated in LC patients. We have previously published data on the differentially regulated proteins in a ME/CFS cohort with an average disease duration of 16\u00a0years, using the same mass spectrometry strategy29, and here we compared the two datasets to identify common or distinct features. We hypothesised that there would be similar molecular pathways affected that would contribute to and explain the closely overlapping symptoms and pathophysiology of both long COVID and ME/CFS. Despite the significant difference in the disease durations of the two groups of patients (1\u00a0year vs an average of 16\u00a0years) many common effects were identified. Therapeutic targeting of the immune response/inflammatory pathways may be beneficial for treatment of both diseases."

            "text": "A comprehensive spectral library containing the peptide spectra of all of the identified proteins in a pool of the samples from all LC and HC subjects was generated through data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry. The pooled sample contained an equal amount of sample from each patient and control subject. The DDA mass spectrometry of the pre-fractionated pooled sample identified 3566 protein groups at a confidence interval of \u2265 99 and an FDR of q \u2264 0.01, which were integrated into the spectral library. After aligning the Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) SWATH-MS data to the spectral library, 3131 proteins and 11,127 individual peptides were used for subsequent quantification between the patient and control groups based on an FDR for a peak matching of q \u2264 0.01 in at least one sample.\nDifferentially regulated proteins in long COVID patients A principal component analysis (PCA) on all quantitative protein data and all samples detected sufficient differences to segregate all LC patients from the HC group in principal component 3 (Fig.\u00a01A). Using the average of all the peptide intensities of each protein for quantification, 162 of the 3131 proteins in the spectral library were identified as being differentially regulated in the LC samples (minimum 1.5-fold change (log2(FC) \u2264 \u2212 0.58 or \u2265 0.58) and a significance threshold of p \u2264 0.05 (\u2212 log10(p-value) \u2265 1.3). The fold change decision for inclusion may vary according to the biological system (cell or human patients) and whether such a fold change is likely to affect the biology\u2014particularly relevant for human studies. A fold change minimum of 1.5 was selected here based on our previously published proteomic studies on samples from human patients and human neural and mammalian neural cells29,38,39. This inclusion limit returned enough proteins to perform a network analysis on proteins of interest biologically.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:22068 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49402-9\nThere were 79 proteins down-regulated (green) and 83 up-regulated (red), as illustrated in the volcano plot (Fig.\u00a01B). A list of all the proteins that were significantly differentially regulated is found in Supplementary Table\u00a0S1.\nA STRING (v12) functional network analysis40 on the 162 differentially regulated proteins showed numerous protein nodes with direct and indirect connections (edges) to other proteins within the set of differentially regulated proteins (Fig.\u00a02A) and highlighted enrichment of proteins associated with a number of Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Table\u00a01, and supplementary Table\u00a0S2).\nThe full network of the 162 differentially regulated proteins (Fig.\u00a02A) comprised 16 protein nodes with first level connections to ten or more differentially regulated proteins. These 16 protein nodes listed here are indicated by their protein symbol and their number of first level interactions is shown in brackets; B2M (16), BCL2 (20), CD4 (22), GFM1 (14), HLA-DRB1 (10), HNRNPM (10), LCK (12), NMP1 (16), NRAS (12), PLCG2 (10), PSMB9 (12), SNRPB (10), SNRPD1 (12), SYK (14), TLR2 (10) and UBQLN2 (11) (see Supplementary Table\u00a0S1 for protein names). This demonstrates a high level of functional association and intra connectivity (betweenness centrality) among the regulated proteins. An enrichment analysis shown in Table\u00a01 highlights a selection of the Reactome and KEGG pathways that suggest the correlations of subsets of these proteins in immune system functions41. DAP12 is a DNAX-activating protein of 12\u00a0kDa that acts as a signaling adapter protein expressed in Natural Killer (NK) cells and myleoid cells participating in innate immune responses42. Terms related to responses to SARS-COV-2, Epstein-Barr virus and HIV infections were prominent (see supplementary Table\u00a0S2 for the full list of enriched GO terms).\nTable\u00a01 indicates that changes in immune system-related proteins feature significantly in the data from LC patients. The STRING network analysis tool returns the number of proteins/genes from the set of significantly differentially regulated proteins, that are associated with any given GO term. This is the \u2018observed gene count (OGC)\u2019, and the \u2018background gene count (BGC)\u2019 is the total number of proteins/genes for that category.

Differentially regulated proteins in long COVID patients clustered into three groups. (A). Graphical representation of a STRING (v12) network of 162 differentially regulated proteins after Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) analysis with an inflation parameter of 1.5. The colours in the full network (A) indicate the clusters of functionally associated proteins. The three main clusters shown in (B\u2013D) are enriched in proteins associated with the following functional GO annotations: B. immune system (Reactome HSA-168256), Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection (KEGG hsa05169), Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity (KEGG hsa04650) and Cytokine Signaling in Immune system (Reactome HSA-1280215); (C). gene expression (GO molecular process GO:0,010,467) and RNA splicing (GO:0,008,380); (D). gene expression and RNA Polymerase II Transcription (GO molecular process HSA-73857). The protein symbol is used to identify each protein and the full names can be found in supplementary material Table\u00a0S1.\n5 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:22068 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-49402-9\nThen Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) analysis43 with an inflation parameter of 1.5 was performed to highlight modules of associated protein nodes within the complex network that show stronger edge interactions to each other than to the rest of the network and therefore allow a more sensitive pathway enrichment analysis by reducing network complexity. Three major clusters were identified that contained 10 or more protein nodes among the 162 differentially regulated proteins in the LC patients (Fig.\u00a02A). One cluster (Fig.\u00a02B) is broadly associated with the immune response, and the other two with gene expression (spliceosome\u2014Fig.\u00a02C), and transcription (Fig.\u00a02D). See supplementary Table\u00a0S3 for complete cluster analysis with the protein names and their predicted functions.\nInterestingly, 17 proteins (out of a possible 411 in the category) in Table\u00a01 are enriched from the Reactome (HSA-9679506) category \u2019SARS-CoV Infections\u2019 (Strength 0.7, FDR 6.37E-05); RIPK1, TLR2, MAN2A1, CSNK1A1, NPM1, SNRPD1, NUP93, SYK, HLA-E, RBBP7, HLA-B, SNRPB, CHMP2A, AP2S1, PTGES3, PLCG2 and B2M. The changed regulation of some of the proteins discussed above that are associated with \u2018Immune System\u2019 in general may have originated first in response to infection, in this case infection with the \u2019SARS-CoV-2 virus\u2019, but persisted with the onset of LC.\nTo identify potential specific pathways involved in LC, a search was made for any specific GO terms where at least 25% of proteins from the small background gene counts (BGC) were differentially regulated in the LC dataset. More highly specialised GO terms describe specific molecular functions that involve fewer proteins i.e. these terms have lower BGC. Examples of GO terms where there are \u2265 25% proteins differentially regulated (OGC/BGC) include \u2018antigen processing and presentation exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class 1b (2/4), \u2018protection from NKC mediated cytotoxicity\u2019 (2/6) and CD4 receptor binding (2/8). The GO terms satisfying this criterion and representing specific immune cell functions have been included along with the relevant protein symbols in supplementary Table\u00a0S4.\nComparison with an earlier study of ME/CFS patients We reported a similar proteome study with a well characterized group of pre-pandemic ME/CFS patients in 2020 compared with age/sex matched healthy controls29. By contrast this patient cohort had been affected by ME/ CFS on average for 16\u00a0years compared with each of the LC cohort for only 1\u00a0year. Although the female to male ratios were different in the ME/CFS study compared with the LC cohort used in this study, we found no PCA separation on the basis of gender or age in the ME/CFS cohort29, and the one male patient in the LC cohort here was within the centre of the LC patient cluster shown in Fig.\u00a01A.\nIn the ME/CFS study, there were 346 differentially regulated proteins compared with the 162 proteins identified in the current LC study that met the same criteria (minimum 1.5-fold change and p-value \u2264 0.05) used for the selection in the LC study (Supplementary Table\u00a0S5). Of these 153 were up-regulated and 193 down-regulated.\nUsing the most recent version of the STRING tool (v12) for consistency, an updated STRING functional network MCL cluster analysis of the regulated proteins from the previous ME/CFS study was carried out and revealed five clusters with 12 or more proteins (Fig.\u00a03); two clusters were broadly associated with the immune system\u2014antigen presentation and cytokine signalling (63 proteins\u2014Fig.\u00a03B) and immune system process\u2014platelet activation, signalling and aggregation (20 proteins Fig.\u00a03C), one with gene expression and metabolism\u2014translation, RNA metabolism, protein metabolism and cellular response to stress (119 proteins\u2014Fig.\u00a03D), and smaller clusters associated with the mitochondria\u2014oxidative phosphorylation (13 proteins\u2014Fig.\u00a03E and vesicle-mediated transport (12 proteins\u2014Fig.\u00a03F).\nA comparison of the STRING pathway enrichment analysis outputs for the LC data against the ME/CFS dataset (re-analysed here at FC \u2265 1.5 with p \u2264 0.05) allowed for the identification of both common and distinct enriched functional categories or pathways between the two datasets.

Supplementary Figure\u00a0S1 shows a Venn diagram of these Reactome pathways and KEGG pathways that were common to the two datasets.\nFor a comparison of the proteins differentially regulated between the LC and ME/CFS datasets we first evaluated the overlap of proteins in the quantitated proteins dataset of both studies. As shown in the Venn diagram in Fig.\u00a04A there were 2032 proteins identified in both datasets, with 1084 only in the LC study, and 915 only in the ME/CFS study. Of the differentially regulated proteins within the 2032 proteins common to both datasets, there were 47/83 of the LC up-regulated and 56/79 of the down-regulated proteins, and 40/153 of the ME/CFS up-regulated and 26/193 of the down-regulated proteins. Nine were up-regulated and six down-regulated common to both LC and ME/CFS data sets, as shown in the Venn diagrams in Fig.\u00a04B and C.\nThe characteristics of those differentially regulated proteins that were detected in both data sets are shown in Table\u00a02.\nFor example, HLA-B, a protein that helps the immune system distinguish self-proteins from those of exogenous viruses and bacteria was significantly down-regulated in both LC group and the ME/CFS group. C16orf54, a transmembrane protein that is suggested to regulate homeostasis of cell energy supply was highly up-regulated in both LC and ME/CFS study groups. In addition to those that were regulated in the same direction for LC and ME/CFS, there were also proteins significantly regulated but in the opposite direction in the two datasets (not recorded in the Venn diagrams in Fig.\u00a04 as overlapping because of their up/down directions). They are also shown in the table. For example, S100A4, a Ca2+binding protein expressed in CD4 + CD25 + lymphocytes is almost fourfold upregulated in the LC study group but 1.5 fold downregulated in ME/CFS study group. CD4+CD25+ immunoregulatory T cells represent a unique lineage of thymic-derived cells that potently suppress both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo effector T cell function and allow tolerance to endogenous antigens to modulate an autoimmune response. Two glial maturation factors (GFM-B & CFM-G) are almost twofold up-regulated in the LC study group but 2\u2013fourfold down-regulated in the ME/CFS group. GMFB, considered a growth and differentiation factor for both glia and neurons and associated with neuroinflammation is up-regulated, while GFMG is a cytokine responsive protein mainly expressed in inflammatory cells and regulates the chemotaxis of neutrophils and lymphocytes.\nAn important outcome of the original ME/CFS published study was that many mitochondrial proteins were identified. They were involved in both general functions, metabolism, electron transport complexes, and the reactive oxygen species stress response. The re-evaluated MCL cluster analysis of the ME/CFS differentially regulated proteins here identified a mitochondrial cluster of 13 proteins (Fig.\u00a03E).\nWhen the differentially regulated proteins from the LC dataset were searched against the Human MitoCarta3.044 database of human mitochondrial associated proteins, 21 of the 162 proteins were identified as mitochondrial (Table\u00a03). The LC differentially regulated proteins in the current study identified a small six protein cluster of mitochondrial proteins (Cluster 7, Supplementary Table\u00a0S3).\nFrom the 83 up-regulated proteins in the LC dataset (Fig.\u00a01B) the 16 up-regulated mitochondrial proteins shown in Table\u00a02 represent an enrichment that does not occur by chance. A binominal test using the binomial distribution range function (BINOM.DIST.RANGE) in Microsoft Excel resulted in a probability of p = 0.018 to identify 16 or more mitochondrial proteins from a pool of 83 up-regulated proteins. By contrast, the probability of finding the 5 down-regulated mitochondrial proteins shown in Table\u00a03 amongst all 79 down-regulated proteins is 0.94, indicating that they could occur by chance. Pathway enrichment analysis of the 83 up-regulated proteins using the STRING database tools (https:// string- db. org/) also showed an enrichment of proteins associated with the mitochondrion at a strength (log10(observed/expected)) of 0.41 and an adjusted p-value of 0.023 (Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure) under the Gene Ontology (GO) aspect of Cellular Compartment, further supporting the conclusion that the mitochondrial proteins amongst the up-regulated proteins represents an enrichment.\nFigure\u00a04.

            "text": "The changes represented in the differential regulation of the proteins in the immune cells of PBMCs from the LC patients determined in this study were significant as indicated from the principal component analysis and were predominately focused in clusters whose functions were related to immune function, and gene expression. Not surprisingly, changes in proteins related to gene expression were highlighted as they would facilitate changes in expression that led to higher or lower amounts of proteins being synthesised. The results indicated that the immune system activity of LC patients one year after the onset of their COVID infectious illness was dramatically different from that of the healthy controls. It reflected a chronic dysfunctional state that had not been restored from the expected transient immune/inflammatory response mounted to cope with the original infection from the SARS-CoV-2.\nThe conclusions described here complement emerging studies with LC patients of changes in cellular immunology22,45. Immune profiling of 215 patients in conjunction with machine learning identified key features that differed from controls45. A study using multi-omics and serology compared LC patients with those who did not develop LC after their SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrating systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation in the LC group. It was concluded the normal crosstalk between the humoral and cellular arms of adaptive immunity had broken down in the LC patients46. A further study up to 24\u00a0weeks post COVID revealed differences in innate immune cells natural killer cells, neutrophils, CXCR3 + monocytes, and in adaptive T cell populations47. LC patients have been shown to have reduced CD4 + and CD8 + effector memory cells48. Somewhat conflicting results have been found also in separate cohort studies of cytokines in LC23,24,49. Interleukin-1\u03b2, IL6 and TN\u03b1 were elevated in those who did not recover from their viral infection indicating these three cytokines may have a significant role23.\nOf the immune system proteins identified in the current study several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins were identified as differentially regulated in both LC and ME/CFS datasets. HLA proteins are transmembrane proteins that bind and present peptide antigens for detection and appropriate immune response by T cells, macrophages and natural killer cells (NK)50 and their role is to aid distinguishing between self and non-self. HLA genes are highly polymorphic and some immunological diseases arise from genetic variation51. Class I and Class II HLA proteins are expressed on antigen presenting cells (B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells). Differential regulation of HLA-B (Class I) and HLA-E (Non-classical Class I) were common to LC and ME/CFS, but HLA-DRB1 (Class II) was differentially regulated in the LC data alone, and HLA-A (Class I), HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DPB1 (both class II) were also differentially regulated in the ME/CFS study. HLA-B was down-regulated in both LC (sixfold) and ME (1.7-fold) suggesting altered T cell recognition and reduced inhibitory signaling in Natural Killer (NK) cells in both disorders.

HLA-E specifically recognises CD94 expressed on Natural Killer (NK) cells52. HLA-E overexpression has been shown to negatively interfere with innate immune responses protecting cells from susceptibility to lysis by NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity53.\nCluster of Differentiation markers (with the prefix CD) are a plethora of antigens on the cell surface of leucocytes. For example, CD5 is a T-cell surface glycoprotein that negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling from the onset of T-cell activation. CD4, 5, 84 and 300LF were differentially regulated in the LC dataset. Upregulated in both LC and ME/CFS datasets, CD4 is involved in the early phase of T cell activation, CD5 regulates T cell/B cell interactions and inhibits T cell receptor mediated signaling from the onset of T cell activation. Downregulated in both datasets, CD84 enhances T cell and NK cell activation and cytokine activation, and CD300LF is an inhibitory receptor of myeloid cells.\nSince LC is a specific example of a post-viral fatigue syndrome that develops from a specific triggering virus and has a symptom profile and clinical case definition very similar to ME/CFS, the collective term that has been given to post-viral fatigue syndromes from multiple triggers, we compared the LC dataset with an ME/CFS dataset we had derived earlier using the same mass spectrometry approach, re-analysing the dataset with the same statistical parameters used in the current study. Data from supplementary Table\u00a0S4 in the ME/CFS proteomic study29 that listed all identified differentially regulated proteins was filtered to give the same stringency (p-value and fold change) as was used in this LC study. With these parameters there were ~ twofold more differentially regulated proteins (346) compared with the LC data set (162) and thereby a somewhat more complex pattern in their clustering patterns (compare Fig.\u00a03 to Fig.\u00a02). Cluster analysis from the ME/CFS data set (Fig.\u00a03) identified two separate clusters related to the immune system and its processes, a large cluster related to gene expression/ metabolism, and two smaller clusters related to mitochondrial energy production, and vesicle mediated transport as the LC data set.\nOf the 34 Reactome categories enriched in the LC data, 22 were also enriched in our earlier ME/CFS data, whereas of the 32 enriched KEGG pathways in the LC data, five were also enriched in ME/CFS (supplementary Figure\u00a0S1). This highlights pathways that are similarly affected while showing there are distinctions.\nA feature of the original ME/CFS study had been the number of differentially regulated mitochondrial proteins. A search of the LC dataset for significantly differentially regulated mitochondrial proteins identified 21\nTable 3. Differentially regulated mitochondrial proteins in the LC data.

Of the 54 differentially regulated mitochondrial proteins identified in the ME/CFS data set, 14 formed a cluster in the string analysis here (Fig.\u00a03E), whereas there was no cluster with at least 10 proteins in the LC string analysis from the 21 mitochondrial proteins identified. Thirty-five of the differentially regulated mitochondrial proteins in the ME/CFS dataset were detected in the 3131-protein spectral library used to analyse the LC data set. Despite the fewer differentially regulated proteins in the LC dataset 17 of these had very similar fold changes in both LC and ME/CFS datasets (supplementary Table\u00a0S7), despite only some meeting the statistical criteria for significance, with the others trending towards significance. This may reflect a wider variation among the LC patient in the levels of differential regulation among some of the mitochondrial proteins.\nPeroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2) is a mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme upregulated in both LC and ME/CFS datasets. PRDX2 reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) by hydrolysing H2O2. Elevated levels of PRDX2 in our studies suggests there is increased ROS generation in both LC and ME/CFS immune cells. PRDX2 has been implicated in neurological disease due to aberrant management of ROS54. Peroxisomes are an independent organelle that metabolically interact with mitochondria but also play a role in ROS production and scavenging, and dysfunctional effects on mitochondria can affect peroxisomal physiology55. Peroxisomal dysfunction is linked with decreased levels of plasmalogens (a class of glycerophospholipids in cell membranes) that have been reported in ME/CFS56.\nAnother up regulated protein in both studies is PSMB9 (proteasome subunit beta type-9 proprotein) that has been linked to autoinflammation and immunodeficiency57. Expression of this gene is also increased in COVID-19 patients58."

            "text": "It should be noted the average duration time of the condition in the ME/CFS group was 16\u00a0years (Table\u00a04), whereas the long COVID patients had a much shorter duration of their post-viral condition (1\u00a0year) so the two groups are at different stages of their ongoing conditions. Now, with so many LC cases synchronized in time as a result of the pandemic longitudinal studies will be possible to follow the course of the dysfunctional pathology of the conditions with time. This has not occurred with ME/CFS as there has been a continuous \u2018drip feed\u2019 of cases from endemic viruses like Epstein-Barr virus, and stressor triggers affecting individuals, as well as cases from boutique infectious disease outbreaks. It may be, despite the many similarities of the result from the two cohorts indicated in this study, that differences reflect the different timepoint since onset of the conditions in the respective cohorts.\nThese analyses are pilot studies with small cohorts of patients. Nevertheless, these patients are very well characterised and diagnosed by an ME/CFS expert clinician using the same clinical case definition. Our growing experience is that with appropriate statistics meaningful significant data can be obtained about the pathophysiology of the post stressor diseases for such small cohorts. Different molecular analyses have repeatedly shown consistent changes to biochemical pathways relating to the same dysfunctional physiology. Longitudinal studies with individual ME/CFS patients acting as their own controls have also been definitive. For example, in a relapse recovery cycle study molecular changes occurred during a relapse but then were restored to pre-relapse levels on recovery32.\np-value false discovery adjustment has not been included with the data presented here due to the low number of n (subjects) and a high biological variability between the subjects. A false discovery estimation using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg procedure resulted in only nine significant differences (adjusted p \u2264 0.05) between the study groups indicating a large number of false negatives after p-value adjustment. The scope of this study was to draw conclusions about biological effects and gain insights into potential mechanisms underlying LC in comparison to ME/CFS by performing a discovery proteomics approach. It was important to consider that false negative identifications from such comparisons would be lost for any data interpretation and may not be considered for any follow up studies, whereas potential false positives can be further tested for their significance by orthogonal methods."

Subgroups have been suggested for ME/CFS patients in multiple publications59\u201362. Indeed, we have examined individual patients by a precision medicine approach within a well characterized homogeneous small subgroup (age/sex, length of illness, relative functional activity levels) and have found individual patient differences in the molecular changes that still\nTable 4.

We believe this reflects the individual\u2019s health history and genetic background that makes them susceptible to mount an inappropriate but immune response with individual variations to an external stressor that becomes chronic and spreads to involve the brain and CNS14, resulting in the ongoing neurological symptoms that characterise the condition. LC is known to be heterogeneous in that it contains those with ongoing organ damage from their SARS-CoV-2 infection as a well as a significant cohort of a classic post-viral fatigue syndrome like ME/CFS. Recently, four clinical phenotypes have been defined in a large LC cohort analysis, the major chronic fatigue-like condition (42%), a respiratory syndrome (~ 23%), a chronic pain syndrome (22%), and a neurosensorial syndrome (~ 11%)5.\nThis may help to explain conflicting results from the study of different cohorts of ME/CFS in the literature if there are different proportions with these phenotypes. It complicates understanding the holistic pattern of changes in the chronic immune system in LC (and in ME/CFS if there are indeed clinical phenotypes).\nHow does the occurrence of clinical phenotypes interfere with obtaining an accurate understanding of how closely related LC and ME/CFS are and on developing therapeutic strategies to improve the health of patients? Multiple papers have documented changes in both peripheral immune cell numbers and their activities, and the up or down regulation of cytokines21. While there may be individual differences dependent upon the viral trigger in LC or heterogeneous triggers in ME/CFS, this is likely also to reflect variations among the individual patients themselves according to their genetic background. The complexity is compounded as regulation can be in either direction according to the state and severity of the illness. Further coherence and integration to the myriad of changes is still required to provide more informed insight into what opportunities there are for therapeutic immune modulation in patients aimed at reversing the cascade of events that have led many to an ongoing severely debilitated state of health with LC, and for many years with ME/CFS. Potential therapeutic strategies to target immune mediated inflammatory diseases like LC and ME/CFS have progressed from broad specificity approaches to highly specific targeting of cytokines and their receptors and to small molecule drugs targeting the inflammatory pathways. Improving the quality of life for LC and ME/CFS patients generally might still be possible if the patient-to-patient variability in immune dysfunction is not too diverse."

The LC patients had contracted the virus ~ 12\u00a0months prior to sampling and been diagnosed with long COVID by an expert ME/ CFS clinician (Dr. Rosamund Vallings) or their own doctor. The ME/CFS cohort from the previously published study29 were a well characterized group clinically who had been diagnosed also by Dr Vallings, and recruited pre-COVID pandemic for the study. Characteristics of the two groups are shown in Table\u00a04.\nAlthough the female to male ratios were different in the ME/CFS study compared with the LC cohort used in this study, we had found no PCA separation on the basis of gender or age in the ME/CFS cohort29, and the one male patient in the LC study here was within the PC3 cluster shown in Fig.\u00a01A.\nThe study conformed to the ethics approval 17/STH/188 for patient studies from the Southern Health and Disability Ethics Committee of New Zealand.

The pellet was washed by gentle resuspension in 6\u00a0ml sterile PBS and centrifugated at 100\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in PBS or 6\u00a0ml FBS containing 10% DMSO when stored in cryovials in liquid nitrogen until required.
