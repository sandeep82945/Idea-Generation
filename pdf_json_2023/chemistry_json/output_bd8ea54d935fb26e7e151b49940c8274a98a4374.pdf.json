    "abstractText": "Flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) is an industrially scalable technology that enables the engineering of a wide range of metal-based nanomaterials with tailored properties nanoparticles. In the present review, we discuss the recent state-of-the-art advances in FSP technology with regard to nanostructure engineering as well as the FSP reactor setup designs. The challenges of in situ incorporation of nanoparticles into complex functional arrays are reviewed, underscoring FSP\u2019s transformative potential in next-generation nanodevice fabrication. Key areas of focus include the integration of FSP into the technology readiness level (TRL) for nanomaterials production, the FSP process design, and recent advancements in nanodevice development. With a comprehensive overview of engineering methodologies such as the oxygen-deficient process, double-nozzle configuration, and in situ coatings deposition, this review charts the trajectory of FSP from its foundational roots to its contemporary applications in intricate nanostructure and nanodevice synthesis.",

            "text": "Flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) is an industrially scalable technique for the synthesis of nanomaterials, which allows to produce many types of metal, or metal-oxide nanoparticles with tailored physicochemical properties [1]. At the heart of the FSP technology lies an intricate process design, involving precursor atomization, combustion, and nanoparticle formation [2]. This enables swift, single-step synthesis, eliminating the need for postproduction treatments commonly required in other methodologies. Recent advancements have further elevated the prominence of FSP in the development of nanodevices, i.e., where nanoparticles can be in situ incorporated in complex functional arrays [3]. Thus, FSP not only revolutionizes nanomaterials\u2019 production but, with recent innovations, also paves the way for the next generation of nanodevices [4]. In the present review article, we provide an updated overview of the current state-of-the-art in FSP technology regarding novel reactor and process designs, novel material production, and nanodevice engineering. In the domain of nanotechnology, nanostructure synthesis represents a critical research area, encompassing a diverse range of methodologies alongside FSP. These alternative techniques, including, but not limited to, chemical vapor deposition, sol-gel processing, and electrospinning, offer unique properties in terms of particle size control, morphology, and chemical composition. The selection of an appropriate synthesis method is contingent upon a set of criteria closely related to the intended application of the nanostructures. Factors such as material versatility, environmental impact, synthesis time, and temperature range play a pivotal role in determining the suitability of a technique for specific applications, which vary from drug delivery systems to photovoltaic devices. In Table 1, we enumerate various methodologies employed in the synthesis of nanomaterials, including FSP, and delineate the specific criteria applicable to their utilization. This careful consideration\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13233006 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 2 of 68\nensures that the synthesis process aligns with the functional requirements of the end application, thereby maximizing the efficacy and utility of the nanostructures produced. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) [5,6] is an alternative to FSP, particularly for engineering thin films. ALD provides atomic-level precision and high-level conformality, producing highly uniform and defect-free films. The downsides include a slower deposition rate, the need for expensive and controlled-environment equipment, and potentially high costs for precursors [5,6]."

            "text": "FSP stands out as an innovative and advanced methodology for the synthesis of nanomaterials, which highlights its vital role in producing a wide array of metal oxide nanoparticles with tailored morphologies and compositions [24]. Inherent in FSP, synthesis at elevated temperatures enhances both the crystallinity and physicochemical attributes of the nanoparticles. By adeptly adjusting operational parameters, such as precursor solution concentration, solvent type, flame temperature, oxygen-to-fuel ratio, and particle residence time in the flame zone, researchers can effectively control the nanoparticle size, distribution, and phase composition. Regarding the technology readiness level (TRL) spectrum, FSP for device applications aligns with TRL 6\u20138 [25]. This placement signifies FSP\u2019s evolution beyond foundational laboratory research [1]. Given the adoption of FSP by certain industries, this positions FSP in the late stages of development and early stages of commercialization, placing it in the TRL 7\u20138 range (see Figure 1) [25].\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 3 of 68\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 69\nby certain industries, this positions FSP in the late stages of development and early stages of commercialization, placing it in the TRL 7\u20138 range (see Figure 1) [25].\nFigure 1.

The resultant advanced nanomaterials/nanodevices encompass perovskites, non-oxides, quantum dots, plasmonics, nanofilms, and sensors.\n1.2. Process Design The process design of FSP [26] begins with the preparation of a metal or metal-organic precursor solution, typically dissolved in an appropriate solvent. This solution undergoes atomization, often facilitated by a high-pressure nozzle, to form a fine spray of droplets [2]. Subsequent ignition of these droplets, often with the aid of an auxiliary flame, leads to the combustion of the solvent and the eventual decomposition of the metal precursors. Within this flame environment, characterized by elevated temperatures, the precursor decomposes, and metal or metal-oxide nanoparticles nucleate and grow [27]. The characteristics of the resultant nanoparticles\u2014size, morphology, crystallinity, and phase composition\u2014can be controlled by diligent choice of the metal precursor, its concentration in the solution, the solvent\u2019s nature, the atomization method, flame temperature, oxygen-to-fuel ratio, and the residence time of particles within the flame. Both inorganic and organic metal salts\u2014including nitrates, acetates, and 2-ethylhexanoates\u2014as well as metalorganic compounds such as acetylacetonates or alkoxides, serve as prevalent precursors [28]. These compounds are soluble in organic solvents, notably xylene (with a standard enthalpy change in combustion [29], \u0394cH298\u00d8 = \u20134550 kJ mol\u20131), toluene (\u20133910 kJ mol\u20131), ethanol (\u20131376 kJ mol\u20131), acetonitrile (\u20131256 kJ mol\u20131), etc. Another pivotal aspect of the FSP design is its continuous mode of operation that enhances its scalability potential, making it an attractive proposition for industrial applications. Furthermore, the high-temperature synthesis environment ensures rapid crystallization of particles, obviating the need for post-process annealing. Meierhofer et al. [1] delineated the relationship between temperature and process residence time during each phase of the droplet-to-particle formation, as represented by the red line in Figure 2a and the\nFigure 1. i re ill strati t e co plex assemblies in flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) discussed in this review.

Koirala et al. in 2016 [37] conducted a thorough examination of catalysts produced through single, double, and enclosed FSP techniques. In the same year, Li and his colleagues [38] detailed advancements in FSP, encompassing substrate usage, applications of\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 6 of 68\nexternal fields, innovative spray methodologies, and the construction of functional apparatus, supplemented by in situ diagnostics and multi-scale simulations. In 2019, Schneider et al. [39] presented the SpraySyn burner as a benchmark instrument for the spray-flame synthesis of nanoparticles. This apparatus offers conditions amenable to simulation and accommodates a variety of precursors. One year later, Pokhrel and M\u00e4dler\u2019s review [40] outlined recent advancements in nanoparticles produced through FSP for sensing, catalysis, and energy storage applications, while Meierhofer and Fritsching in 2021 [1] provided a detailed analysis of FSP\u2019s historical context, design, growth mechanisms, and diagnostic methodologies, emphasizing its prospective opportunities and challenges. Meanwhile, Venkatesan et al. [41] highlighted that FSP offers a scalable and proficient approach to address the complexities of electrocatalyst synthesis for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and solid oxide cells (SOCs), streamlining conventional multistage procedures. In 2022, Tran-Phu et al. [42] presented a review on Power-to-X (P2X) technologies, underscoring the significance of sustainable energy storage with zero CO2 emissions. Within this context, FSP is identified as a crucial technique for enhancing the production of efficient (photo)electrocatalysts. Ultimately, within that year, John and Tricoli\u2019s review [43] probed the particle formation mechanism, drawing insights from micro-explosions in single droplet experiments across diverse precursor\u2013solvent pairs. The discussion emphasizes the importance of layer fabrication for industrial applications, including gas sensors, catalysis, and energy storage. Herein in this review, we focus on recent advancements in product and nanodevice development by FSP. In Section 2, we review key aspects of engineering of complex assemblies via FSP, as well as mechanisms and process designs such as the oxygen-deficient process, double-nozzle configuration, in situ coatings, FSP deposition, sequential/nano-film deposition, and scale-up industrial production that enable the creation of intricate nanostructures. In Section 3, we discuss examples of complex functional nanostructures and nanodevices synthesized via FSP, such as perovskites, non-oxides, quantum dots, plasmonics, nanofilms, and sensors unraveling their potential applications and the scientific underpinnings that govern their multifaceted functionality."

            "text": "The concept of oxygen-deficient synthesis can pertain to anoxic or reduced metal oxides. In the literature, these are referenced as MKOL\u2212x where K and L are the stoichiometry coefficients that determine the stable crystal phase MKOL. In this terminology, x signifies the O-deficiency coefficient.\nHere, for the sake of the discussion, we classify these materials in three cases:\n[i] O-vacancies generation with no change in the crystal phase: lack of O atoms from the lattice, compared to the formal stoichiometry of the nominal crystal phase, with no modification of the crystal phase.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 7 of 68\n[ii] Generation or reduced metal atoms with no change in the crystal phase: lack of O atoms from the lattice can stabilize lower-oxidation states of the metal atoms.\nOften, cases [i] and [ii] are interlinked since the reduction in individual metal atoms in the lattice can be triggered thermodynamically from the generation of one or more O-vacancies in its immediate vicinity.\n[iii] Stabilization of a reduced crystal phase via lack of O atoms: certain O-deficient metal oxides can stabilize reduced phases. This occurs when a significant fraction part of the metal atoms is reduced. For example, magnetite Fe3O4, which contains one Fe2+ and two Fe3+, can be formed from Fe2O3 (two Fe3+) when 1/3 of the Fe3+-atoms is reduced to Fe2+. Further reduction in all Fe atoms to Fe2+ forms the FeO phase, while further reduction to Fe0-atoms forms the metallic, zero-valent-iron material. Similarly, Cu2O (SnO) is formed when all Cu2+ (Sn4+) atoms in CuO (SnO2) are reduced to the Cu1+\n(Sn2+) state.\nTable 2 presents a list of literature data on the use of anoxic FSP to engineer nanostructures. The concept of using an oxygen-lean FSP was pioneered by Grass et al. to produce oxygen-deficient metal-oxide particles [44] by placing the FSP nozzle inside a glove box filled with inert nitrogen and regulating the intake of oxidizing gas as illustrated in Figure 4b,c. The dispersion gas mixture in the flame can shift from a CO2/H2O composition (representing traditional, oxidizing flames, see Figure 4a) to a CO/H2/H2O mixture (under reducing conditions) [44]. Noble metal nanoparticles, including Pt, Au, Ag, and their alloys, can typically be produced even in oxygen-rich FSP, i.e., due to the thermodynamic preference of the metal state vs. the oxide state by the noble metal atoms. However, creating non-noble metals necessitates a reductive environment. When cobalt or bismuth organic precursors [45], such as cobalt(II)- and bismuth(III)-2-ethylhexanoate (more information in Table 2), are burned in a controlled atmosphere (with O2 levels less than 100 ppm) and with a high fuel-to-oxygen ratio (see Figure 4b), it enables the swift production of pure Co and Bi metal nanoparticles, enhancing the conventional flame process. With this experimental setup, Stark et al. have explored the creation of metallic bismuth nanoparticles ensuring no soot formation [46]. While the reducing environment might be beneficial for producing metallic particles on a large scale [45,47], it comes with the risks of incomplete combustion [1]. In the case where the oxygen supply is further constrained, a fine carbonaceous layer tends to form on these metal nanoparticles [47,48]. Using this experimental setup, NiMo nanoalloys [49] and ZnS nanocompounds [50] have been reported. Strobel and Pratsinis used an oxygen-deficiency FSP process [51] in order to synthesize Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and FeO nanoparticles. Their setup featured an FSP nozzle with a metal tube (4 cm in diameter and 40 cm in length) positioned directly above it (as shown in Figure 4b). Situated 20 cm above the FSP nozzle and angled at 45\u25e6, an internal mix spray nozzle was directed downward. This nozzle delivered deionized water at a rate of 10 mL/min, dispersed using 5 L/min of N2. A different oxygen-deficiency FSP setup for the production of Fe3O4 nanoparticles may be the utilization of a laminar, inverse diffusion flame [52]. This method takes advantage of the properties of the inverse flame, created when an oxidizer is injected into a flow of surrounding fuel [53]. Contrary to conventional flame approaches, this setup ensures that the iron particle formation occurs in a predominantly reducing atmosphere. As illustrated in Figure 5a, the burner features two concentric brass tubes with specific outer diameters, enclosed within an 11.4 cm diameter acrylic chamber. This chamber is crucial for protecting the flame from ambient air, preventing additional particle oxidation and potential secondary diffusion flame formation due to excess fuel reacting with room air. The oxidizer, either pure O2 or an O2-Ar mixture, is released from the innermost tube and is encircled by a blend of fuel (methane or ethylene), argon, and iron precursor vapor. A N2 flow enveloped the resulting inverse flame.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 8 of 68\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 69\nadditional particle oxidation and potential secondary diffusion flame formation due to excess fuel reacting with room air.

[59], producing in one nozzle Al2O3 and in the second nozzle Pt/BaCO3, thus forming individual Al2O3 and monoclinic BaCO3 nanoparticles. Increasing the internozzle distance delayed flame product mixing, increasing the crystallinity of BaCO3. In contrast, the single-nozzle process yielded Al2O3 particles with amorphous Ba species. The two-nozzle process enhanced NOx storage behavior, while the single-nozzle approach showed negligible NOx retention [59]. Following this successful novelty method, a series of Al2O3-based articles were published, herein chronologically presented: Minnermann et al. [60] produced in one nozzle Al2O3 and in the other pure oxide or mixed CoOx. Single flame synthesis is inadequate for producing an effective Al2O3/Co FT catalyst due to inadequate reducible cobalt oxide support particle size. The DN-FSP geometry significantly influences the resulting catalyst, yielding smaller alumina particles as the intersection distance increases, resulting in good adhesion of the two oxides and good stabilization. H\u00f8j et al. [61] produced Al2O3/CoMo by DN-FSP, and varying flame mixing distances (81\u2013175 mm) minimized the formation of CoAl2O4, detectable only at short flame distances. Notably, employing DN-FSP synthesis achieved superior promotion of the active molybdenum sulfide phase, potentially attributed to reduced CoAl2O4 formation, consequently enhancing Co availability for promotion. Schubert et al. [62], through DN-FSP, produced Al2O3/Co enhanced with Pt (0.03, 0.43 wt%) deposition in the first nozzle and other materials in the second nozzle. Noble metals enhance catalyst reducibility, yielding abundant metallic Co sites. Due to their high cost, optimizing synthetic strategies for low concentrations is essential. Regardless of the preparation approach, adding 0.03 wt% Pt significantly improves catalytic activity in CO2 methanation, and 0.43 wt% Pt marginally increases the catalyst reduction. Using DN-FSP, Horlyck et al. [63] produced Al2O3/Co with Lanthanum doping (0\u201315 wt%).

Nanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 69\ndeposited Pt particles [67]. Geometric configurations in DN-FSP strongly influenced Pt particle size and distribution on TiO2. Larger intersection distances and smaller angles result in nonuniform large and broadly distributed Pt clusters on TiO2. Conversely, smaller distances and larger angles enhance Pt dispersion and a uniform mixing, akin to single flame; however, DN-FSP allows for individual tuning of compound particle sizes. Solakidou et al. produced {TiO2-Noble metal} nanohybrids, with deposition of Pt0, Pd0, Au0, or Ag0 [68]. As shown, DN-FSP is superior vs. single-nozzle-FSP for finely dispersing noble metals on TiO2 support, achieving a narrower size distribution [50]. DN-FSP promoted intraband states in TiO2/noble metal, reducing the band gap. Efficient H2 generation presented the following trend: Pt0 > Pd0 > Au0 > Ag0, in line with a higher Schottky barrier upon TiO2 contact [50]. G\u00e4\u00dfler et al. produced SiO2, TiO2, and SiO2-TiO2 mixture with DN-FSP deposition of Co3O4 (see Figure 8c\u2013f) [65]: titania, comprising anatase and rutile phases, the SiO2-TiO2 mixed support, with separate anatase and silica phases. H2O adsorption varies significantly based on the support: SiO2 < SiO2-TiO2 < TiO2. CH4 formation rate increased with higher TiO2 fractions, while CO formation rate peaked in the mixed support. Psathas et al. used DN-FSP to engineer heterojunctions of perovskite SrTiO3 with deposited CuO nanoparticles (0.5 to 2 wt%) [58]. Higher CuO deposition led to larger SrTiO3 particle sizes due to increased enthalpy from the second flame [40]. Scanning TEM depicted small CuO particles (<2 nm), mainly found on the surface of SrTiO3. The dopant concentration significantly controlled the selective production of H2 or CH4 from H2O/CH3OH. CuO incorporation drastically shifted production to CH4, achieving a rate of 1.5 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121 for the La:SrTiO3/CuO catalyst (0.5 wt%) [58].\nTiO2: Grossmann et al., through the utiliz ti of DN-FSP, produced TiO2 with deposited Pt particles [67].

Changing the geometrical parameters of DN-FSP altered the proportion of interfacial sites vs. copper surface sites. As active sites are primarily at the metal\u2013oxide interface, ZrO2/CuO with smaller CuO clusters exhibited higher activity in methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation. Gockeln et al., by a combination of DN-FSP and a lamination technique [73], synthesized in situ carbon-coated nano-Li4Ti5O12 Li-ion battery electrodes. Li et al. synthesized LiMn2O4 spinel as a cathode material for Li-ion batteries via screening 16 different precursor\u2013solvent combinations [70]. To overcome the drawback of capacity fading, the deposition of AlPO4 (1\u20135%) via DN-FSP was homogeneously mixed with LiMn2O4. The optimal 1% AlPO4 with LiMn2O4 demonstrated an energy density of 116.1 mA h g\u22121 at 1 C (one-hour discharge). Henning et al. used DN-FSP to engineer luminescent biosensors CeO2:Eu3+/Y2O3:Tb3+ [66]. CeO2:Eu3+ nanoparticles (6 nm, 22 wt%) and Y2O3:Tb3+ nanoparticles (32.5 nm, 78 wt%) were shown to function as robust optical-based ratiometric H2O2 biosensors (see Figure 8g,h). Based on the collective effect, H2O2 caused significant luminescence quenching in CeO2:Eu3+ nanocrystals, but Y2O3:Tb3+ nanoparticles were unaffected [48]. Asymmetric Double Flame: Lovell et al. utilized asymmetric-DN-FSP geometry to control the SiO2 interaction with Ce0.7Zr0.3O2 nanoparticles [71]. Tuning the intersection distance during DN-FSP (18.5 to 28.5 cm) prevented silica coating. Short intersection distances led to high surface-area silica encapsulating ceria-zirconia, while longer distances suppressed this encapsulation. The material at longer intersection distances, used as Ni support for dry methane reforming, showed enhanced oxygen storage capacity and basicity, yielding a highly selective catalyst. Psathas et al. used asymmetrical-DN-FSP-deposited NiO or Pt0 nanomaterials on the surface of Ta2O5 or the perovskite NaTaO3 [72].

NaTaO3/NiO produced from FSP had half the photocatalytic hydrogen production than those from DN-FSP. Also, DN-FSP had a ten times higher yield than the conventional deposition of wet-impregnated NiO. Similar results were found for the photocatalytic efficiency of NaTaO3/Pt0, which was 30% more photocatalytically active than the conventional liquid-Pt photo-deposition method [54]."

The innovative design of their apparatus, featuring a torus ring with multiple jets, ensured the accurate in-flight coating of particles (shown in Figure 10a). A crucial aspect of their work was to understand how the SiO2 content in resultant particles can be manipulated through process adjustments, influencing the size of the nanosilver particles and preventing their agglomeration. The particles were covered in-flight by injecting HMDSO through a torus ring equipped with multiple evenly spaced and uniform jets, each having a diameter of 0.6 mm. This injection occurred at a specific height referred to as the burner ring distance (BRD). Regardless of the BRD values, the length of the tube above the torus ring was maintained at 40 cm. HMDSO vapor-laden N2 gas at a flow rate of 0.8 L/min was obtained by bubbling nitrogen gas through liquid HMDSO at varying temperatures, through the jet openings. The amount of HMDSO injected was adjusted to achieve a targeted theoretical coating thickness (CT) of either 3 or 6 nm [79]. The SiO2 content in the resulting particles was determined under complete saturation conditions. Our research group extended this knowledge and developed Ag@SiO2 particles with a slightly modified experimental setup [80,81] illustrated in Figure 10b. The HMDSO vapor was generated by bubbling N2 gas through 300 cm3 of HMDSO contained in a glass flask, which was maintained at a temperature of 10 \u25e6C. Under saturation conditions, this configuration resulted in a theoretical SiO2 production rate of 5.9 g/h, equal to 20 wt% SiO2 in the product powder [80]. More recently, we have demonstrated that ring-coating FSP allows engineering safe-by-design core-shell SiO2 materials with diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation [82]. As shown in [64], this stems from the flexibility of ring-coating FSP toward modulating the thermal profile during nano-SiO2 synthesis. A cooler SiO2-formation process allowed for the surface passivation of the nanosilica, consequently decreasing its ROS generation potential [64]. In this process, the N2 gas, which served as a carrier of the atom to be dispersed, played a pivotal role in the cooling dynamics [83]. More recent research works include the use of ring-spraying FSP for the production of stable core-shell ZnO@SiO2 [84], CuOx@SiO2 (see Figure 10d) [85], SiO2@YAlO3:Nd3+ [86], and SiO2-coated Y2O3:Tb3+ [87] along with their FSP characteristics listed in Table 4.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 16 of 68\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 17 of 68"

Such films have exhibited superior efficacy in applications like chemical sensors [92], photodetectors [93], and solar cells [94]. Homogeneity in films still remains a challenge, especially since cracks can easily form when drying films, i.e., created through traditional wet-phase coating methods. However, films formed in the gas phase [2] do not require drying, leading to more consistent layers, e.g., as in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods [95]. The film\u2019s structure resulting from FSP deposition largely relies on the substrate temperature and the stage of particle formation when reaching the substrate. Characteristically, Figure 12b illustrates a schematic of a nanofilm deposition procedure.

When uncovered precursor comes into contact with the substrate, it produces denser films [28] whereas airborne product particles result in highly porous particle films, as depicted in Figure 13a.

The mechanical integrity of nanostructured layers hinges on the substrate temperature at the time of deposition. While mechanically robust layers can be achieved at elevated temperatures (850 \u25e6C), these temperatures do not align with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) substrates that host circuit components, as they cannot withstand temperatures exceeding 400 \u25e6C. Thus, Tricoli and his colleagues introduced a strategy for stabilizing deposits thermally by using an in situ rapid flame treatment on nanoparticle micropatterns deposited at low temperatures [99]. This technique can be applied while keeping the substrate at low temperatures, and the original\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 19 of 68\ncrystallite size remains unchanged. The synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles occurs through the dispersion and ignition of a precursor spray solution of the target material\u2014 in [98], it was SnO2. Particle growth progresses through condensation, surface growth, coagulation, and sintering, producing nanocrystalline material (as seen in Figure 12d(i)). Factors like high-temperature particle residence time (HTPRT), metal concentration, and droplet dispersion during FSP influence the particle size [2]. Nanostructured particles then adhere to the substrate in situ, usually forming a highly porous layer. However, due to the substrate\u2019s low temperature (150 \u25e6C), this layer has limited mechanical resilience. To enhance its stability, a second phase involves subjecting to thermal curing in FSP, e.g., an \u201cimpinging\u201d step, for 30 s using a particle-free xylene flame, as depicted in Figure 12d(ii). This treatment profoundly alters the layer\u2019s texture, enhancing its adhesion to the substrate. Patterns of nanoparticles, with sizes as small as 100 \u00b5m, were created by positioning a shadow mask, designed with a series of circular openings, against a Si-wafer (coated with a thin layer of silicon nitride), as shown in Figure 12d [99]."

            "text": "Several of the methods used for nanoparticle synthesis are not scalable, i.e., to transcend laboratory production toward industrial scale for large-volume production. These facts are against the actual implementation of real-life applications, hindering the connection of lab research to market-level production. When more complex nanoparticles require time-consuming synthesis protocols with complex processes, these factors lead to very high prices per kilo of particles [100]. Gas-phase synthesis has already shown much promise for the industrial production of nanoparticles. So far, single-metal nanomaterials are produced through gas-phase processes [27]. Gas-phase synthesis includes many essential commodity products that have been widely produced for many years, with some of the most widespread nanomaterials for the industry, such as carbon black by the company Cabot [101] as a reinforcing agent, P25 (TiO2) by Evonik Industries [102] renowned for its photocatalytic properties, pigmentary titania by the companies DuPont, Cristal, and Ishihara, fumed silica (SiO2) by Cabot and Evonik, as well as ceramic-based nanoparticles with the application of flame aerosol processes. The production of flame-made nanoparticles generates millions of tons with a valuation reaching $15 billion/year [38]. The successful utilization of aerosol-made nanomaterials in the market indicates that the industrial-scale manufacturing of gas phase will expand further with future applications, using more complex particles and multicomponent particles that cannot be easily produced at industrial scale with other methods [1]. Utilizing the advantages of FSP, several start-up companies have grown to produce various particles with controlled characteristics to fill the demand for niche markets [103]. Today, Hemotune AG (Schlieren, Switzerland) [104] produces polymer-decorated iron nanoparticles with carbon encapsulation for the purpose of blood purification. Examples are Anavo Medical (Zurich, Switzerland), for bioactive hybrid metal oxides, and Avantama AG (St\u00e4fa, Switzerland), for the production of several metal oxides [103]. Such start-up companies include Turbobeads AG (Zurich, Switzerland) [105], which creates amine-functionalized cobalt carbon-coated nanoparticles. HeiQ Inc. (Schlieren, Switzerland) [106], which recently had an IPO with a valuation of 127 M\u00a3, produces nanosilver by FSP, the third most market-demanded nanomaterial, following carbon black and fumed oxides [107].\nFSP synthesis can be implemented by laboratory FSP with production of 10 g h\u22121\nto establish the synthesis optimization protocol and the initial exploration for complex particles and industrial-scale FSP with production rates at kg h\u22121 [108]. With lab-scale FSP, many particles reach 10 g h\u22121. Examples include HfO2 (5 nm, 89 SSA) at 15 g h\u22121 [109] and CeO2 (8 nm, 101 SSA) at 10 g h\u22121 [110]. Pratsinis et al. synthesized particles of silica/titania with a production rate of 200 g h\u22121 [111,112], showing very different results with the change in the fuel flow rate and the oxygen flow rate parameters. In this context, many simple oxides have been synthesized with FSP, such as WO3/TiO2 [113], or more\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 20 of 68\ncomplex nanoparticles, such as La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3\u2212\u03b4 with production rates as high as 400 g h\u22121 [114]. Industrial FSP: In Table 5, the industrial-scale FSP publications are presented in chronological order and their synthesis/structural characteristics are listed. The first industrial-scale FSP production was demonstrated for SiO2, by Mueller et al., producing uniform 25 nm particles at 1.1 kg h\u22121 [115]. The study investigated the primary particle diameter, morphology, and carbon content by HMDSO in EtOH at 1.26 M and 3.0 M, as well as pure HMDSO at 4.7 M. Notably, the average primary particle size of the product was precisely controlled within the range of 10 to 75 nm, irrespective of the precursor concentration. Additionally, it was observed that utilizing air instead of O2 as the dispersion gas resulted in minimal variation in the product particle size. Mueller et al. achieved ZrO2 with a production rate of 0.6 kg h\u22121 with an average size of 30 nm [116]. The study evaluated zirconium n-propoxide in EtOH at 0.5 M and 1 M concentrations. Primary particle size ranged from 6 to 35 nm, with the crystal structure mainly tetragonal (80\u201395 wt%). The primary particles showed weak agglomeration, forming loosely agglomerated single crystals. Gr\u00f6hn et al. produced ZrO2 at 0.5 kg h\u22121 [117] with increased technological expertise by a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model showing the fundamentals of the high-temperature particle residence time (HTPRT) for the scale-up synthesis of nanomaterials (see Figure 13a,b). HTPRT effectively regulated primary particle and agglomerate size, morphology, and ZrO2 crystallinity. Maintaining a constant HTPRT while scaling up the production rate from \u223c100 to 500 g h\u22121 showed no significant alteration in product particle properties. In this context, Meierhofer et al. explored CFD-PBM modeling of ZrO2 FSP synthesis [118] at high productions to discover the attributes of the resulting nanoparticles. Jossen et al. produced yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y2O3/ZrO2) with the same parameters, with only the molarity dropped by half, decreasing the production rate at 0.35 kg h\u22121 [119]. Homogeneous Y2O3/ZrO2 exhibited an average crystallite and particle diameter ranging from 8 to 31 nm, with yttria content varying between 3 and 10 mol%. Interestingly, the yttria content had no discernible impact on the primary particle and crystal sizes.\nWegner et al. produced FePO4 nanoparticles with 0.27 kg h\u22121 with a mean size of 129 nm (see Figure 13c) [108]. Additionally, a cost analysis for the scale-up FSP was calculated with the pilot plant production costs for simple oxides projected to be less than 100 EUR per kilogram. Among the cost components, raw materials constitute the most significant cost factor in this estimation. Hembram et al. manufactured ZnO nanorods with the highest production rate so far, at 3 kg h\u22121. The resulting nanorods had a length of 30 nm and a mean aspect ratio of the rods at 2.3 [120]. Numerous nanorods self-aligned by creating junctions at the basal planes and some were further assembled into tetrapods. The nanorod aspect ratio was controllable through adjustments in the concentration of Zn ions in the initial precursor solution, its delivery rate, and the oxygen flow into the reactor.

The required filter temperature was T > 310 \u00b0C up to 360 \u00b0C to reach 100% crystallization, resulting in the scheelite-monoclinic phase, in agreement with the Tammann temperature of BiVO4 [109], which occurred at 300 \u00b0C.

Moreover, the sensor exhibited good selectivity against other gases and good stability against oxygen and water vapor concentration fluctuation, with long-term stability for 22 days [127]. Perovskite La1\u2212xFeO3\u2212\u03b4 sensors (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.1), with A-site deficiency, were successfully synthesized by FSP [128], with pure orthorhombic phase and size below 10 nm size. The materials were applied for chemo-resistive CO2 sensors, La0.95FeO3\u2212\u03b4 was the optimal stoichiometric material for 5\u201315% CO2 at 425 \u00b0C. Due to surface oxygen\nFigure 15. FSP formation of perovskite structure ABO3 requires avoidance of the formation of the two separate oxides (A-oxide, B-oxide).\nThe publications rega ding perovskite synthesis by FSP (see Figure 15), listed in Table 6, are rather limited in nu er so far. T first publication was by Kho et al. who de onstr te the s nthesis of BiVO4 by FSP [122], where they noticed a bottleneck disadvantage of crucial importance for FSP perovskit formation\u2014that is the short HTPRT, in the order of milliseconds, was inadequate to induce the perovskit phase (see Figure 16a,b). In si u thermal curing, on the filter, was necessary to achieve the desir d scheelite BiVO4 phase [122]. The required filter temper ture was T > 310 \u25e6C up to 360 \u25e6C to reach 100% crystallization, resulting in the scheelite-monoclinic phase, in agreement with the T mmann\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 23 of 68\ntemperature of BiVO4 [109], which occurred at 300 \u25e6C. Stathi et al. [123] demonstrated that FSP can engineer W- and Zr-Doped BiVO4 in tandem with control of the BiVO4 lattice oxygen vacancies (VO). W-doping had a minor change on the BiVO4 XRD peaks, although W-doping (10%) caused a major deterioration of the crystallinity. Zr-doping above 1% showed peaks attributed to cubic-ZrO2 particles of 3 nm diameter. Function-wise, the presence of oxygen vacancies in W-BiVO4 and Zr-BiVO4 drastically improved the O2 production efficiency [123]. Psathas et al. [124,125], in their study of the engineering of perovskite BiFeO3 by FSP, concluded that the short HTPRS did not allow for the in situ formation of crystalline BiFeO3. They observed that a very short post-calcination of 5 min at 550 \u25e6C allowed for the formation of pure phase BiFeO3. This shows that the FSP-made BiFeO3 material consisted of small nanometric crystallites that were organized in larger BiFeO3 crystalline particles upon a small thermal/calcination boost [124,125]. Additionally, via the same protocol, mullite-type Bi2Fe4O9 was synthesized (see Figure 16c). These BFO materials were employed for the reduction of 4-Nitrophenol to 4-Aminophenol [124] and showed a low-activation energy Ea = 22 kJ mol\u22121 for BiFeO3, which is comparable to that of noble metal-based catalysts. Highly efficient photocatalytic O2 evolution, as shown in [125], was promoted via the introduction of Fe2+ centers in BiFeO3 via a downshift of the CB and VB edges. FSP-made Bi2Fe4O9 exemplified a highly efficient O2 evolution photocatalyst for the first time [125]. Punginsang et al. [126] reported the engineering of layered perovskite oxide Bi2WO6 consisting of FSP-made orthorhombic phase spherical Bi2WO6 nanoparticles (3\u201330 nm in diameter) and a very high specific surface area of 197.8 m2g\u22121. The high thermal stability FSP-Bi2WO6 nanoparticles were applied for gas-sensing measurements and displayed a stable and selective response of 3.72\u20132000 ppm toward acetone at 350 \u25e6C and good selectivity against other gases, surpassing similar materials made by other methods. Recently, Xiao et al. [127] reported a successful FSP synthesis of LaCo(Fe-dopped) O3. In [127], a LaCo1\u2212xFexO3-based sensing was evaluated as an ammonia sensor, reaching a detection limit of 2 ppm at 475 \u25e6C. These effects were corroborated based on the oxygen vacancy and improvement in electrocatalytic performance by doping iron. Moreover, the sensor exhibited good selectivity against other gases and good stability against oxygen and water vapor concentration fluctuation, with long-term stability for 22 days [127]. Perovskite La1\u2212xFeO3\u2212\u03b4 sensors (x = 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.1), with A-site deficiency, were successfully synthesized by FSP [128], with pure orthorhombic phase and size below 10 nm size. The materials were applied for chemo-resistive CO2 sensors, La0.95FeO3\u2212\u03b4 was the optimal stoichiometric material for 5\u201315% CO2 at 425 \u25e6C. Due to surface oxygen vacancies attributed to the small amount of Fe4+, this A-site deficiency might be responsible for enhanced sensing performance [128]. Recently use of FSP to engineer SrTiO3 perovskite (see Figure 14a\u2013f) was established by Yuan et al. [129\u2013131] and Psathas et al. [58]. In [129], SrTi1\u2212xBxO3 (B = Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Cu) were produced by FSP at different concentrations (10%, 30%, 50% for Co, 10% for everything else). Co cation was shown to be evenly dispersed in the SrTiO3 structure based on EDX mapping, with an increase in dopant and the growing diameter of active Co particles aligning with TEM findings (see Figure 16d\u2013g). As the cobalt concentration increased from 10 to 50 mol%, the size of Co particles progressively expanded, consequently reducing metal dispersion from 6.50% to 2.18%. Substituting B-site in SrTiO3 with varied valence metal cations created vacancies, enhancing CO/CH4 oxidation, with SrTi0.5Co0.5O3 exhibiting the highest activity [129]. In [130], SrTi1\u2212xCuxO3 particles were reported, with different copper concentrations (10%, 15%, 30%), with the copper species either as amorphous species or/and highly dispersed particles below 5 nm, with XRD indicating that copper ions replaced the Ti4+ in the perovskite lattice. Catalytic low-temperature CO oxidation and CH4 combustion at high temperatures were exemplified [130]. In [131], Sr1\u2212xNaxTi1\u2212yByO3 (B = Co, Mn) with x = 0, 0.1 and y = 0, 0.3, 0.5 were produced by FSP [131]. Doping the perovskite with Na and Co resulted in notably larger SSA from 43 to 65 m2 g\u22121 compared\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 24 of 68\nwith cobalt doping alone. Sr0.9Na0.1Ti0.5Co0.5O3 demonstrated superior low-temperature reducibility, higher adsorbed oxygen ratio, and well-dispersed Co elements, resulting in outstanding thermodynamic and kinetic activity for formaldehyde oxidation [131].\nRecently, Psathas et al. presented the synthesis of La:SrTiO3/CuO particles by DN-FSP, in tandem with La doping [58]. EDX showed that La doping was homogeneous throughout the SrTiO3 matrix, with no secondary phases formed, such as La2O3. Additionally, a pinkhue color is observed in comparison to the white SrTiO3, evidencing a change in the band gap of the SrTiO3. Interestingly, it was found that La doping significantly increased the SSA and pore volume of La:SrTiO3, from 32 to 53 m2/gr, and more significantly, produced a 300% increase in pore volume to 0.39 cm3 g\u22121. As discussed in [58], this is a result of the FSP process where the La doping decreases the packing/aggregation of the SrTiO3. La doping consistently boosted SrTiO3 photocatalytic activity, with 0.9% La doping exhibiting a five-fold increase in H2 production to 12 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121 compared with 3 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121 for pristine SrTiO3 [58]. Small-size NaTaO3 was achieved by FSP recently [72,132]. As discussed in [72,132] the inherent need for high-temperature FSP, i.e., HTPRT, required for achieving the ABO3perovskite formation, poses the challenge of retaining low particle size. As shown in [72], this can be achieved by FSP via diligent control of the temperature profile in the FSP reactor. In this way, highly crystalline small NaTaO3 particles < 15 nm were engineered in one step, outperforming conventional synthesis methods where the previous best size reached 25 nm and typical sizes range around 100 nm [72]. An electron paramagnetic resonance study [132] of these ultrasmall NaTaO3 particles, 12 nm, revealed the significant influence of the nanosize on the life time of photoinduced {h+/e\u2212} pairs. As the NaTaO3 particle size increases, the recombination rate increases and this holds the key to unraveling the fundamental photocatalytic capabilities, e.g., in H2 production [72] of such nanomaterials [132].\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 25 of 68\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 25 of 69\nin [58], this is a result of the FSP process where the La doping decreases the packing/aggregation of the SrTiO3.

To the utmost extent of our current knowledge, no investigation in regard to the synthesis of nitrides through the FSP methodology has been documented up to the present date. Nitride synthesis via FSP entails a multitude of intricate factors, encompassing nitrogen reactivity, gas chemistry, temperature control, precursor material selection, and prudent safety considerations, collectively rendering it a formidable and demanding process.

With respect to flame-made sulfides, a limited number of investigations have been reported in the scientific literature [50,142,143]. Originally, to facilitate the controlled combustion of a ZnS precursor within an environment characterized by oxygen-poor conditions (O2 < 250 ppm), the flame spray nozzle was positioned within a glove box and supplied with nitrogen to establish a reducing atmosphere [50]. Specifically, in [50], Athanassiou et al. mixed ZnO aerosol stream with in situ H2S, which the latter obtained via reductive decomposition of tetrahydrothiophene (THT). Additionally, reducing FSP synthesis was used to investigate the manufacturing of sulfide\u2013oxide PbS\u2212TiO2 heterojunction nanoparticles [142]. Similarly, these investigations were conducted within an enclosed box under a N2 purging environment (as shown in Figure 18a,b). Recently, Pokhrel et al. [143] achieved a significant advancement in this front regarding metal-sulfide nanoparticle synthesis with FSP. As a proof-of-principle [131], MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are synthesized in an O2-lean and sulfur-rich environment, specifically with metal:sulfur ratios ranging from 1:20 to 1:45 and average primary particle sizes in the range of 10\u201330 nm (refer to Figure 18d). Explicitly, the researchers mixed all the metal-organic precursors (M = Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Ag, In, Sn, Bi) with THT directly utilizing enclosed single-droplet (SD) combustion and enclosed reactive spray (RS) FSP configurations (see Figure 18a) [143].

These studies encompass a broad spectrum of research, examining the properties, applications, and advancements in the realm of phosphates produced via FSP methodology. Kang et al. [157] explored the synthesis of Sr5(PO4)3Cl:Eu2+ phosphor particles through a dual-method approach, employing both conventional spray pyrolysis and flame spray pyrolysis techniques. Subsequently, these synthesized particles underwent post-treatment at a high temperature of 1000 \u25e6C over a duration of 3 h within a controlled reducing atmosphere consisting of a gas mixture containing 5% H2/N2. The primary objective of this post-treatment was to activate and optimize the luminescent properties associated with the europium (Eu) component integrated into the phosphor matrix. This process served to enhance the photoluminescence (PL) intensity for light-emitting diode applications [157]. Another work [146] focused on the polymorphic compound VOPO4, known for its exceptional catalytic and electronic properties. For the first time, the utilization of FSP, as an alternative to the conventional hydrothermal synthesis method, is explored to produce various VOPO4 polymorphs [146]. The precursor materials employed in this process consisted of ammonium-based salts, i.e., vanadium and phosphorus, dissolved in an aqueous solution. The resulting FSP products were characterized as hollow, amorphous particles [137] with dimensions 2 to 10 \u00b5m and shell thicknesses between 200 and 300 nm (see Figure 20f,g). Last, the study highlighted\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 32 of 68\nthe size-dependent stability of different VOPO4 polymorphs and examined the influence of distinct precursors in stabilizing the alpha-II and Beta VOPO4 polymorphic forms [146]. Nanostructured iron phosphate particles hold appeal for the fortification of staple food products, such as rice and bread, on a large scale [158,159], as well as for their utility in lithium-ion battery materials [160]. Rohner et al. [147] aimed to synthesize FePO4 nanoparticles for bioavailability and assess their toxicity in rats. Amorphous, spherical FePO4 nanopowders were produced via FSP and compared with commercial FePO4 and FeSO4. The FePO4 nanoparticles, both commercial and FSP-produced (mean particle sizes: 30.5 and 10.7 nm), exhibited promising SSA and in vitro solubility, with RBV values close to FeSO4. Importantly, no toxicity indications were observed in histological examinations and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) analysis, suggesting that reducing poorly soluble Fe compounds to the nanoscale could enhance their suitability for human nutrition [147]. Likewise, Rudin and Pratsinis [148] produced FePO4 nanostructured particles FSP, utilizing cost-effective precursor materials. The resulting powders consisted of a fraction of large (mostly > 50 nm) particles made by droplet-to-particle conversion that consisted of maghemite iron oxide (Fe2O3) and a small fraction of the desired amorphous FePO4. The FePO4 powders exhibited excellent solubility in dilute acid, an indicator of relative iron bioavailability [148]. Waser and colleagues [149] employed FSP to synthesize nano-sized spherical LiFePO4 (58 nm)\u2013carbon core-shell (\u22485 nm) particles (see Figure 20b) in a single-step process, achieving a production rate of 7 g per hour, with the intended application for use in Li-ion batteries. A customized FSP apparatus, enclosed within three quartz glass tubes, was employed for this study (as depicted in Figure 20a) [149]. At specific heights, precisely 40 cm and 55 cm above the burner, gaseous C2H2 and N2, respectively, were introduced into the gas stream. This configuration partitioned the reactor into three clearly defined zones: [i] an oxygen-rich core particle formation zone, [ii] an oxygendeficient region dedicated to C2H2 pyrolysis and carbon coating, and [iii] a designated area for quenching and cooling processes [149]. Li-acetylacetonate, iron(III)-acetylacetonate, and tributylphosphate were combined in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:1 (mole ratio Li:Fe:P) and subsequently dissolved within an equimolar mixture of 2-ethylhexanoic acid, toluene, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, and ethanol. This process yielded a precursor solution with a concentration of 0.24 mol L\u22121. Additionally as evidenced, the work of Badding et al. [150] pertains to an FSP technique for the production of nanoscale lithium metal phosphate ceramic powders. The precursor solution may incorporate an excess of lithium ranging from 1% to 20% concerning the stoichiometric composition of the ceramic powder. The resulting nanoscale ceramic powders are characterized by nominal compositions denoted as LixAl2\u2212yMy(PO4)3 (<50 nm diameter), with M representing either titanium (Ti) or germanium (Ge), 1 \u2264 x \u2264 2 and 1.3 \u2264 y \u2264 1.9. Various precursors, such as Li t-butoxide, Al tri-sec-butoxide, Ti isopropoxide, trimethyl phosphate, Li chloride, or Ge ethoxide, were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol or ethanol to produce the aforementioned lithium metal phosphate nanopowders [150]. Last but not least, it is worth noting that in the past decade and up to the present, various other studies have employed FSP to fabricate nanoscale calcium phosphates (CaP) [161], representing a significant area of scientific investigation and technological development in the field of biomaterials and biomedicine [151\u2013153]. Nanometer-sized biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) powders, featuring various Ca/P molar ratios to achieve specific phase ratios of hydroxyapatite (HA) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (b-TCP), were systematically synthesized using a high-temperature FSP process [151]. These BCP powders displayed spherical morphologies and exhibited narrow size distributions (mean particle size = 38 nm), irrespective of the Ca/P ratios employed. The composition ratio of Ca/P was precisely controlled within the range of 1.500 to 1.723 in the spray solution, allowing for systematic adjustment of the required HA/TCP phase ratios. The FSP configuration comprised an ultrasonic droplet generator and quartz reactor. The precursors employed in this process consisted of calcium nitrate and tetrahydrate diammonium phosphate dissolved in a mixture of ethyl alcohol and distilled water. The degradability of the synthesized BCP\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 33 of 68\npowders was studied by the dissolution of calcium ions in a buffer solution under conditions mimicking a human physiological environment [151]. Ataol and colleagues [152] conducted an evaluation of the synthesis of biocompatible nano CaP particles with osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties. These particles were synthesized using an industrially applied aerosol-derived FSP method, with a focus on their potential applications in the biomedical field. The characterization results confirmed that nanometer-sized, amorphous, spherical CaP particles were produced with an average primary particle size of 23 nm. Urine-derived stem cells, resembling mesenchymal stem cells, were exposed to the synthesized amorphous nanoparticles (5\u201350 \u00b5g/mL) with no cytotoxicity. Nanoparticletreated cells exhibited increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, indicating osteogenic differentiation, although a slight decline in ALP activity occurred at the highest Ca:P ratios (50 \u00b5g/mL) on day 7. These findings suggest that the CaP nanoparticles generated in this study hold promise as potential biomaterials for biomedical applications [152].

CaP nanoparticles doped with 5 at% europium (vs. Ca) enabling their\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 34 of 68\ndetection through luminescence monitoring. These CaP nanoparticles were loaded with model proteins and peptides, and the factors affecting their loading capacity were explored. They also successfully load LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide currently in clinical trials, onto CaP nanoparticles, achieving high loading efficiency and protection against proteolysis in vitro. Importantly, LL-37 maintains its antimicrobial activity against specific pathogens when loaded onto nanoparticles, emphasizing the potential of nanocarriers for optimizing the therapeutic performance of biological drugs [153]. It is noteworthy that a limited body of research, as documented in studies [154,155], has pursued the synthesis of metal carbonates by FSP. Huber and colleagues demonstrated the production of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles of 20\u201350 nm by FSP [144]. This method involved the combustion of designated calcium-containing precursors, leading to the formation of either amorphous or crystalline calcium carbonate particles, contingent upon the specific spray flow conditions employed. Moreover, Strobel et al. fabricated nanoparticles of bean-like-shaped barium carbonate (BaCO3) with sizes ranging from 50 to 100 nm using FSP (refer to Figure 21). They used barium(II) 2-ethylhexanoate precursor dissolved in ethanol. The key aspect of this preparation process was the rapid quenching, which led to the unique occurrence of pure monoclinic BaCO3 formation.

Engineering of Metallic Nanoparticles by FSP Reducing FSP has been shown to allow for the production of metallic nanoparticles (Bi, Cu, Fe, Co). Highly pure metallic bismuth (Bi) nanoparticles [46], with a purity exceeding 98%, were synthesized using a modified flame spray synthesis method conducted in an inert N2 atmosphere, with a radial flow rate of 25 L min\u20131. This synthesis process involved the oxygen-deficient combustion (O2 < 100 ppm) of a precursor derived from bismuth carboxylates. Scanning electron micrographs revealed the presence of nearly spherical nanoparticles with diameters of 20\u201380 nm. Copper nanoparticles (C/Cu) featuring an average carbon coating thickness of approximately 1 nm were synthesized by Athanassiou et al. using a reducing FSP method with a N2 atmosphere. TEM images of the C/Cu powder showed that the product consisted of spherical nanoparticles with a diameter of 10\u201320 nm [47]. Using R-FSP, Li et al. [156] synthesized metallic spherical Fe nanoparticles (size: 30\u201380 nm) encapsulated by a magnetite Fe3O4 core-shell structure, exhibiting a uniform thickness of 4\u20136 nm (see Figure 22b). Precursors were based on ferrocene in a solvent mixture xylene and tetrahydrofuran. The ignition of the spray occurred through the utilization of a supported inverse H2/air diffusion flame with specified flow rates (H2: 0.76 m3/h, air: 0.8 m3/h) (see Figure 22a). Additionally, cooling of the spray flame was achieved by introducing 1.5 m3/h of N2. The systematic investigation revealed that controlled nonstoichiometric combustion of the precursor solution leads to morphological and compositional variations in flame-synthesized metallic Fe nanostructures. They proposed a competitive mechanism between in situ flame combustion reduction and oxidation reactions to elucidate the metallic Fe formation [156]. Cobalt nanoparticles [57] were systematically produced through R-FSP conducted under strongly reducing conditions, akin to [46]. A sintered metal tube encompassing the flame facilitated radial inflow of an inert mixing gas (N2 or CO2) at a flow rate of 25 L min\u20131, ensuring stable combustion. These spherical nanoparticles, with diameters of 20\u201360 nm, exhibited a metallic face-centered cubic cobalt structure.

            "heading": "3.4. Engineering of Quantum Dots by FSP",
            "text": "Quantum dots (QDs)\u2014with early contributions from pioneering Nobel laureates Ekimov, Brus, and Bawendi [163\u2013165]\u2014represent quasi-zero-dimensional (0D) nanomaterials that have garnered considerable interest among researchers [166\u2013171]. QDs are semiconductor nanoparticles characterized with dimensions 10 nanometers. When their dimensions become commensurate with or smaller than the Bohr radius of the respective material, they manifest distinctive characteristics positioned between those of bulk semiconductors and discrete molecules [168,172]. This phenomenon is distinguished by the confinement of excitons within all three spatial dimensions, resulting in the quantization of their energy levels into discrete states [172,173]. A complex challenge concerning the photocatalytic properties of QDs pertains to the differentiation between the advantages arising from increased specific surface areas, stemming directly from reduced particle size, and the emergent properties of the nanolattice, which underpins fundamental solid-state physics [174]. So far, QDs are typically synthesized through [i] top-down syntheses or [ii] bottom-up approaches [170]. For [i], the most commonly used to achieve QDs are electron beam lithography [175,176] and etching processes [177,178] while the wet-chemical (sol-gel [179\u2013181], microemulsion [182,183], hot-solution decomposition [165,184]), and vapor-phase methods (molecular beam epitaxy [185], sputtering [186], chemical vapor deposition [187]) are included in [ii]. The aforementioned methods are characterized by extended processing times, multiple steps, and yielding production rates on the order of milligrams per day. Regarding the FSP production of metal-oxide QDs, there are only a few studies, see Table 8. M\u00e4dler et al. [188] reported FSP synthesis of stable zinc oxide quantum dots (ZnO QDs) down to 1.5 nm in diameter (see Figure 23a) stabilized and prevented from growth by adding controlled amounts of silica during spray combustion of Zn/Si precursors [167]. These ZnO QDs exhibited a quantum size effect with a blue shift of light absorption, and\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 36 of 68\ntheir band-gap energy of the ZnO QDs was shown to increase with silica content in the spray and particles consistently [167]. Correspondingly, Riad and colleagues [189] had proposed embedding quantum dots in amorphous matrices such as silica (see Figure 23b). The study demonstrated that FSP can be used to synthesize QDs of many metal oxide semiconducting materials, including TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, and CuO, embedded in a SiO2 matrix [168]. The resulting spherical QDs (mean sizes: 2\u20138 nm) were found to have a wide range of band gap energies, which could be controlled by adjusting the metal oxide material and the silica content. The SiO2 matrix provided higher mechanical, thermal, and/or chemical stability to the QDs, making them suitable for various applications. Yuan et al. [130] explored the utilization of FSP-made CuO(QD)-SrTiO3 nanocatalysts for the full oxidation of lean CO and CH4. Good performance was achieved due to CuO QDs and metal\u2013support interaction (see Figure 23c). The SrTiO3 perovskite support was discovered to efficiently block CuO quantum dot sintering at high temperatures, resulting in good sintering and water deactivation resistance. Bi et al. [190] fabricated in situ a nano\u2013TiO2 composite material modified by incorporation of internal and external C-species. Specifically, the authors developed a heterostructure composed of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and TiO2-C through FSP and post-FSP thermal treatment (under Ar/O2 atmosphere) (see Figure 23d,e). During the millisecond-scale reaction process, a portion of the residual carbon resulting from the incomplete combustion of ethanol infiltrates the TiO2 lattice, giving rise to interstitial carbon (Ci) and substituent carbon (Cs). Concurrently, the remaining amorphous CQDs adsorb onto the TiO2 surface. Their investigations, employing in situ temperature-programmed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (in situ TPXPS) in combination with various analytical techniques, confirmed the successful fabrication of the CQDs/TiO2-C heterostructure through the flame-based approach, with the atomic ratio of the two carbon species approximating 1:1. This investigation sheds light on the impact of a novel electron transfer pathway established between lattice-bound carbon (C) and CQDs within the CQDs/TiO2\u2013C system during the process of CO2 photoreduction, resulting in a conversion efficiency of 46 \u00b5mol g\u22121 h\u22121 and nearly 100% selectivity for CO2-to-CO conversion.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 37 of 68\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 38 of 68\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 38 of 69 SnO2 QDs Open-flame FSP reactor Sn-2-ethylhexanoate, hexamethyldisiloxane Xylene 0.25 0.1 2.5/1.25 1 3.75 2.2 [189] CuO QDs Open-flame FSP reactor Cu-2-ethylhexanoate, hexamethyldisiloxane Xylene 0.25 0.1 2.5/1.25 1 3.75 1.4 [189] CuO QDs \u2212SrTiO3 Metal tube with gap, sheath Ar gas flow (8 L min\u20131) Cu nitrate trihydrate/ Sr acetate, n-butyl titanate Ethanol/ acetic acid 0.15 \u2013 1.5/0.75 2\u20135 5 <5 38\u201350\nPbS QDs \u2212TiO2 Enclosed box under N2 purge (O2 < 140 ppm) Pb(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, Ti(IV) isopropoxide, thiophene Ethylhexanoic acid, THF (2:1)\n\u2013 2.4/1.13 5 4\u20134.5 2 75\u201385 [142]\nCQDs/ TiO2\u2013C\nOpen-flame FSP reactor and\npost-treatment with Ar/O2 atmosphere\nTetrabutyl titanate Absolute ethanol \u2013 H2/O2:\n3.3/16.7 (L min\u22121)\n5 5 <5 [190]\nBi2WO6 QDs\nOpe-flame FSP reactor\nW hexacarbonyl/ Bi neodecanoate Tetrahydrofuran /xylene\n0.3 \u2013 3.2/1.5 5 5 2.2 [191]\nFigure 23.

            "text": "Nanoplasmo ics is a multidisciplinary field of study within the realm of nanophotonics that investigates the interaction between electromagnetic waves and collective oscillations of fre electrons, known as su face plasmons, at the int rface of metals and dielectric materials [192,193]. In the cont xt of nanoscale dimensions, the phe omeno of l calized surface plasmon res ance (LSPR) becomes prominent y evident [194,195]. LSPR can be analyzed as comprising both radiative and nonradiative processes: [i] The radiative plasmon decay encompasses the phenomenon of light scattering by the surface of plasmonic particles, thereby giving rise to the distinctive and vibrant colors associated with noble metals. It involves the transfer of energetically \u201chot\u201d electrons upon irradiation, characterized by substantial kinetic energy, to a compatible acceptor species [196]. Additionally, it engenders the creation of localized amplified electric near-fields, the so-called hot spots owing to the confinement of surface plasmons and incoming photons in the immediate vicinity of the particle [197]. [ii] The nonradiative plasmon decay and the ensuing thermal energy generation may be comprehended as the dissipation of electromagnetic energy into thermal energy. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a distinct subfield known as thermoplasmonics [198], which harnesses the photothermal characteristics of metallic nanoparticles for various applications. Overall, plasmonics finds diverse applications in various scientific and technological domains, including nanoscale optical waveguiding,\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 39 of 68\nsensing, imaging, and enhancing the efficiency of photonic devices, making it a promising area for advancing our understanding of light\u2013matter interactions and facilitating the development of innovative technologies across multiple disciplines. Hereby in this subsection, we shall delineate the research endeavors in which the FSP technique has been successfully employed to engineer plasmonic nanoensembles, with the corresponding characteristics listed in Table 9. The concept of plasmons was originally postulated in the year 1952 by David Pines and David Bohm [199]. These plasmons were subsequently demonstrated to originate from a Hamiltonian governing the long-range electron\u2013electron correlations [200]. Given that plasmons represent the quantized manifestations of classical plasma oscillations, a substantial portion of their characteristics can be directly deduced through the framework of Maxwell\u2019s equations [201]. Nevertheless, it took approximately half a century for the synthesis of plasmonic nanostructures utilizing the FSP methodology to be achieved. Plasmonic phenomena are principally ascribed to noble metallic elements, notably silver (Ag), gold (Au), and copper (Cu), notwithstanding the potential for plasmonic attributes to manifest in other metallic and material compositions, contingent upon specific environmental conditions. Ag and Au, in particular, display strong plasmonic properties primarily in the visible and near-infrared regions, while copper also exhibits plasmonic behavior, albeit less pronounced, especially in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum. Several scholarly studies have documented the production of plasmonic materials integrated with support matrices (metal oxides) through the FSP method. The predominant synthesis technique for plasmonic materials involves the use of SiO2 as a core-shell structure (see Figure 24). Silica (SiO2) encapsulation of plasmonic Ag nanoparticles through FSP offers a host of valuable advantages. This method ensures stability by protecting silver nanoparticles from oxidation, while also enhancing their plasmonic properties. Researchers can precisely tailor the nanoparticles\u2019 properties by controlling the thickness of the silica shell. Moreover, the biocompatibility of silica makes these nanoparticles suitable for diverse medical applications. SiO2 shell effectively prevents particle aggregation, ensuring stability in various solvents. Additionally, the silica surface provides a platform for easy functionalization, allowing for targeted interactions. These attributes collectively position them as valuable tools in nanotechnology, materials science, and biotechnology applications (see Figure 25).\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 40 of 68\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 40 of 69\nstability by protecting silver nanoparticles from oxidation, while also enhancing their plasmonic properties.

This stems from their ability to create localized electromagnetic field enhancements at the nanoscale, leading to increased scattering cross sections and, thus, contributing significantly to the amplification of the Raman signal of analyte molecules in close proximity [214,215]. In the study of Hu et al. [211], the ultrathin SiO2 shell (1 nm), served a dual purpose by effectively preventing the coalescence of Ag nanoparticle cores at elevated temperatures and functioning as a protective layer for the SERS-active nanostructure. Silica-coated Ag nanoparticles form agglomerates within a large temperature gradient zone, maintaining nanometer-scale gaps between them without direct contact (see Figure 26a). This distinctive feature leads to the creation of numerous Raman hot spots at the interstitial regions among the active Ag core sites, enhancing the overall performance of the SERS substrate. The results [211] demonstrated that the maximum enhancement factor can reach approximately 105, with a detectable concentration as low as 10\u221210 mol L\u22121 for rhodamine 6G (R6G) molecules, highlighting the potential of this unique nanostructure for SERS applications (as shown in Figure 26b).

            "text": "Nanofilms, also known as thin films or particle films, are precisely engineered ultrathin layers with nanometer-scale thicknesses that display distinct properties and applications. Nanofilms find diverse utilization in various scientific and technological realms, including optics, electronics, and materials science. Their applications encompass optical coatings for enhancing light transmission or reflection, functional layers in electronic devices, protective coatings against corrosion and wear, templates for the fabrication of nanostructures, and can be efficiently utilized in challenging chemical processes of immediate technological importance, such as H2 production and CO2 reduction, to name a few. The precise control over their thickness and composition allows for tailoring the properties of nanofilms to meet specific requirements, making them indispensable in the advancement of nanotechnology and various cutting-edge technologies. Nanofilms are typically fabricated using various synthesis methods: physical vapor deposition (PVD) [216], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [217], sol-gel deposition [218], layer-by-layer assembly (LbL) [219], spin coating [220], Langmuir\u2013Blodgett (LB) technique [221], and chemical bath deposition (CBD) [222]. Subsequently, we shall revisit some foundational studies and present recent advancements in the fabrication of nanostructured films through the utilization of FSP methodology (parameters specified in Table 10). In the mid-2000s, M\u00e4dler and coauthors [92] synthesized both undoped and Pt-doped tin dioxide nanoparticles in a single-step process. The aerosol generated via the dry FSP approach was directly subjected to in situ thermophoretic deposition onto interdigitated Pt-electrodes, yielding a porous film with a regulated thickness within the sensor\u2019s active region. A consistent tin oxide grain dimension (10 nm) and elevated film porosity (98%) were maintained across all film thicknesses, spanning from 9 to 40 \u00b5m, by adjusting deposition durations. Despite varying deposition times, the tin oxide grain size remained at 10 nm with a film porosity of 98%. Platinum doping had no impact on the SnO2 grain size or film structure. These sensors showcased exceptional carbon monoxide (CO) detection capabilities, especially at 350 \u25e6C, with high repeatability and sensitivity. In situ platinum doping improved sensor performance, while adjusting film thickness provided a means to modify sensor resistance. La0.6Sr0.4CoO3\u2212\u03b4 (LSC) thin films, fabricated by Karageorgakis et al. [223] on sapphire substrates and ceria-gadolinia oxide (CGO) pellets using flame spray deposition at 200 \u25e6C, were initially amorphous and dense (refer to Figure 28f,g). The precursor solution was formulated by dissolving lanthanum nitrate, strontium chloride, and cobalt nitrate in N,Ndimethylformamide, resulting in a concentration of 0.006 M. Post-annealed at temperatures above 600 \u25e6C, they exhibited nanocrystalline grains, with sizes from 21.4 \u00b1 5 nm at 700 \u25e6C to 124 \u00b1 22 nm at 900 \u25e6C. Early annealing stages introduced 10\u201323% porosity, which reduced upon further thermal treatments. Electrochemical tests underscored the necessity of crystallinity for optimal LSC film performance [223]. Films annealed at 400 \u25e6C had high area-specific resistance (ASR) values (5.8 \u2126 cm2) at 600 \u25e6C, whereas those annealed at 700 \u25e6C achieved a lower ASR of 0.96 \u2126 cm2. However, annealing beyond 700 \u25e6C raised the ASR due to grain enlargement. Over a 5-day evaluation at 550 \u25e6C, ASR degradation was 3.9% for 700 \u25e6C-annealed films and 7% for 800 \u25e6C-annealed ones, indicating that 700 \u25e6C-annealed LSC films hold promise for micro-solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) applications [223].\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 46 of 68\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 47 of 68\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 47 of 69\nAs discussed in Section 2.5, the deposition of SnO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles from FSP reactors onto temperature-controlled substrates is influenced primarily by the temperature difference (\u0394T) between the aerosol and substrate [98]. For SnO2, the deposition rate increased linearly with time and was dominated by thermophoresis up to \u0394T of 121 K. This mechanism was linked to the rapid formation of large agglomerates. The primary particle concentration of a SnO2 aerosol aligned with its mobility size distribution, accounting for agglomerate structure and size (see Figure 28e). The study also provided an entrainment rate for surrounding air. Findings suggest that nanoparticle deposition rates for similar aerosols can be predicted using initial precursor concentrations, making the model applicable to various nozzle designs and FSP settings [98].

The FSP system was employed to directly deposit ZnO nanoparticle films onto glass substrates with Au-interdigitated electrodes (see Figure 28a\u2013d) [93]. A solution of 0.3 M zinc naphthenate in xylene was supplied at 5 mL min\u22121, dispersed using 7 L min\u22121 O2, and ignited with a premixed O2/CH4 flame. Substrates, situated 20 cm above the burner, were kept below 150 \u25e6C using a water-cooled holder. Through optimization of the film structure, an absorption rate exceeding 80% of incoming ultraviolet radiation while maintaining a transmission rate approaching 90% for visible light was achieved. Further examination of the photodetector\u2019s efficacy, especially under minimal light intensity conditions (0.1 mW cm\u22122), yielded a significant photo-to-dark current ratio of 3.4 \u00d7 105. Such results underscore the potential of this architecture, offering a versatile and scalable technological framework for the swift, cost-efficient production and assimilation of ultraviolet photodetectors in CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor)-compatible mobile apparatuses [93]. Li et al. [229] have presented FSP-based engineering SERS sensing substrates. Plasmonic Ag-SiO2 nanoaggregates were deposited on glass substrates, yielding consistent and efficient SERS sensing films. These substrates exhibited remarkable uniformity, sensitivity, and batch consistency [226]. Compared with other commercial alternatives, these substrates achieved similar performance but at a lower cost, suggesting their broad applicability. Their work\u2019s standout feature was the use of a real-world sample, fresh orange juice, demonstrating SERS\u2019s potential for on-site, label-free detection of contaminants in specific pH conditions using minimal samples [229]. Bletsa et al. [230] synthesized a visiblelight-responsive Ag/TiOx coating optimized for application on medical devices, aiming for targeted biofilm eradication. Fabricated via the direct deposition of flame aerosol onto substrates, this methodology facilitated simultaneous nanoparticle generation and film formation (see Figure 29). The outcome is a porous nano-thin suboxide Ag/TiOx particulate layer, which exhibited visible-light photocatalytic activity within, enabling the generation of superoxide radicals adept at biofilm disruption [227]. Various Ag/Ti (Ag acetate/Ti(IV) isopropoxide in a 1:1 mixture of 2-ethylhexanoic acid and acetonitrile) weight concentrations, ranging from 5% to 50%, were produced [230]. The deposition varied in duration from 5 to 60 s, impacting film thickness. These films were mechanically stabilized via in situ annealing with an ethanol spray (as shown in Figure 29a). Notably, the biocompatible surface of the coatings, derived from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), exhibited no cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells. Emphasizing the eradication of pre-existing biofilms and evaluating antibiofilm activity on nanoparticle coatings, this study underscores the promise and durability of such coatings for medical device applications [230]."

Following FSP, both undoped and AgOx-doped SnO2 nanostructures, ranging from 0.1 to 1 wt%, were homogenously dispersed within an organic paste comprising ethyl cellulose and \u03b1-terpineol. This dispersion process was undertaken with the intention of fabricating the sensing films. An optimal 0.2 wt% Ag content yielded a strong response to HCHO, with high selectivity, stability, and minimal sensitivity to environmental conditions (refer to Figure 30a). The improved performance is attributed to p-n heterojunctions and catalytic effects between AgOx and SnO2 [236]. Kaewsiri et al.

The sensor also exhibited robust selectivity against various gases and maintained stability amid environmental fluctuations. A 22-day test revealed minimal response variance, and the study also touched upon the sensor\u2019s underlying mixed potential sensing mechanism [127]. Moreover, nanoparticles of SnO2 doped with 0.1\u20132 wt% Nb were synthesized for the first time using FSP [238]. Structural analyses, including XRD and electron microscopy, confirmed Nb5+ integration within the lattice of nanocrystalline tetragonal SnO2 particles (5\u201315 nm). Sensing layers, created through spin coating, were evaluated against 0.05\u20131 vol% acetylene (C2H2) from 200\u2013400 \u25e6C in the air. Optimal performance was noted with 0.5 wt% Nb, yielding a sensor response of \u223c776 and a rapid 1.1-s response time at 350 \u25e6C. This Nb-doped SnO2 sensor displayed minimal humidity interference, prolonged stability, and heightened C2H2 selectivity against various compounds. The results underscore the Nb dopant\u2019s catalytic and electronic contributions, positioning the Nb-enhanced SnO2 sensor as a viable candidate for C2H2-sensing applications [238].\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 52 of 68\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 53 of 68\nThe same research team [240] synthesized Rh-doped SnO2/electrochemically exfoliated graphene hybrid materials via flame processes and conducted a comprehensive study on their gas sensing capabilities, particularly toward hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Structural analyses showcased an enhanced surface area due to the integration of graphene sheets on Rh-substituted SnO2 nanoparticles. In systematic evaluations against various gases from 200 to 400 \u25e6C in diverse humidity levels (20\u201380% RH), it was discerned that 0.5 wt% Rh doping substantially improved the H2S sensing of SnO2 nanoparticles. Incorporating an optimal 0.5 wt% graphene further optimized this sensing capability. Specifically, the 0.5 wt% graphene-loaded 0.5 wt% Rh-doped SnO2 sensor yielded peak responses of \u223c439 and a swift 6.5-s response to 10 ppm H2S at 350 \u25e6C, with pronounced selectivity against other gases. This enhanced H2S detection was attributed to the combined effects of catalytic Rh dopants and the active interfaces between graphene and Rh-doped SnO2 [240]. Utilizing the FSP method, ultrafine \u03b2-Ga2O3 nanomaterials with a grain size of 6\u201312 nm and a surface area above 100 m2/g are produced [241]. Introducing Nb(V) during synthesis results in its integration into the \u03b2-Ga2O3 lattice but annealing above 800 \u25e6C forms a separate GaNbO4 phase. The incorporation of Nb(V) into \u03b2-Ga2O3 results in charge compensation within the cationic sublattice, manifesting through a Ga(III) to Ga(I) electronic transition. Despite these alterations, Nb(V) doping does not significantly enhance the gas-sensing properties of \u03b2-Ga2O3. The best sensor response is observed with 1 mol% Nb(V) doped Ga2O3 after annealing at 900 \u25e6C for 24 h. These samples excel in gas and VOC detection (H2, CH4, acetone) and offer improved long-term performance [241]. Recently, La2O3-loaded WO3 nanoparticle films, produced via FSP by Siriwalai et al. [242] using spin-coating techniques, were optimized and analyzed for NO2 sensing. Characterization techniques confirmed the presence of 1\u20132 nm La2O3 nanoparticles on 5\u201320 nm WO3 nanoparticles. For NO2 detection, the optimal performance was achieved with La concentrations up to 0.2 wt% and three spin-coating cycles. This configuration yielded a response of approximately 7213.6 to 5000 ppb NO2 with a 31.8 s response time at 150 \u25e6C. The sensor also showed high NO2 selectivity against other gases and volatile organic compounds, with minimal humidity interference (refer to Figure 31) [242]. Jiao et al. [128] synthesized A-site deficient perovskite nanomaterials, La1\u2013xFeO3\u2013\u03b4 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.1), using the FSP method and employed them in chemo-resistive CO2 sensors. XRD, TEM, and XPS confirmed the material\u2019s structure and indicated enhanced CO2 sensing due to surface oxygen vacancies and Fe4+ ions. Among tested materials, La0.95FeO3\u2013\u03b4 was optimal for detecting 5\u201315% CO2 at 425 \u25e6C, showing a response of 3.38 to 10% CO2. This sensor effectively distinguished CO2 from common vehicular emission gases but showed sensitivity to water vapor. Consequently, La0.95FeO3\u2013\u03b4 emerges as a promising candidate for CO2 monitoring in vehicle exhaust [128]."

            "text": "In the field of electrocatalysis technology, comprehensive evaluations have assessed the effectiveness of particles produced by FSP for electrocatalytic applications. Electrocatalysis involves the facilitation of electrochemical reactions via a catalyst affixed to an electrode, effectively lowering the activation energy barrier. The process encompasses the adsorption of reactants onto the electrode-bound catalyst, followed by an electron exchange during which the reactant is either oxidized or reduced. Subsequent desorption of the reaction product from the catalyst surface allows the transformed species to enter the bulk solution. This sequence enhances the reaction kinetics, with the rate-limiting step being a primary determinant of overall efficiency. Electrocatalysts are selected for their efficiency in specific electron transfer processes, optimizing the conversion of reactants to desired products. In photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis (see Figure 32a), light-excited semiconductors produce electron\u2013hole pairs that drive redox reactions at electrode interfaces, aided by electrocatalysts, which lower activation energies and improve reaction kinetics, enabling efficient light-to-chemical energy conversion.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 54 of 68\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 52 of 69 Incorporating an optimal 0.5 wt% graphene further optimized this sensing capability.

Debecker et al. [244] provide a comprehensive examination of how aerosol processing technologies are revolutionizing the preparation and application of heterogeneous catalysts in various chemical reactions, aiming at both current and future innovations. Similarly, Sheng and colleagues [235] highlight FSP as a key technology for the economical and scalable production of catalytic nanomaterials. Chen and collaborators [94] present FSP as a crucial technique for fabricating nanostructured films, emphasizing its role in advancing sustainable energy technologies, particularly in the context of water catalysis for hydrogen fuel production. In our introductory section, we referenced Tran-Phu et al. [42] who underscore the role of FSP in developing effective (photo) electrocatalysts for sustainable energy storage systems without CO2 emissions. Concurrently, John and Tricoli [43] delve into the advancements and future potential of flame-assisted nanofabrication in the context of device integration and industrial applications. Some studies have selected flame-made cobalt oxide for electrocatalytic processes because it is considered a very promising material for electrochemical reactions. This is due to its high catalytic activity, reasonable electrical conductivity, chemical stability in various environments, high surface area, and versatile morphology. In the study conducted by our laboratory, Belles and coauthors [245] developed flame-made Co3O4/CoO nanocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrodes. In an acidic environment, an electrode composed of 5.2% Pt and 4.8% Co3O4 exhibited optimal ORR efficiency, achieving a maximum current density of 8.31 mA/cm2 and a half-wave potential of 0.66 V. Conversely, in an alkaline setting, an electrode with 0.4% Pt and 9.6% CoO/Co3O4 demonstrated enhanced performance (Jmax = 3.5 mA/cm2, E1/2 = 0.08 V). Pozio et al. [246] and Tran-Phu et al. [247] utilized FSP to manufacture Co3O4 spinels for use in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In addition, Liu and colleagues [248] investigated the electrocatalytic capabilities of Co3O4 nano-islands, which were directly synthesized and deposited using FSP, as OER catalysts for hydrogen generation on FTO glass substrates. Tran-Phu and colleagues [227] explored the photooxidation of BiVO4 photoanodes with porosities from 12% to 18%, finding that 46% porosity offered the best photocurrent density for sulfite and water oxidation due to optimal charge transport and reaction surface area (Figure 32c\u2013f). Daiyan et al. [249] revealed that subjecting flame-synthesized CuO nanomaterials to mild plasma treatment introduced oxygen vacancies/defects. These defects were closely linked to enhanced performance and endurance in nitrogen oxide reduction reactions (NOxRR), resulting in an ammonium (NH4+) production rate of 520 \u00b5mol cm\u22122 h\u22121 at a cell voltage of 2.2 V in a flow electrolyzer (see Figure 32b).

Their highquality metal oxide semiconductors, characterized by purity and crystallinity from the flame method, exhibit desirable chemical stability and electronic traits beneficial for various energy devices. Subsequent paragraphs will offer a succinct overview of notable flame-generated material compositions and device structures. A fuel cell is an energy conversion device that transforms the chemical energy of a fuel, typically hydrogen, and an oxidant, usually oxygen from the air, into electricity through an electrochemical reaction, bypassing the traditional combustion process [252]. The basic components of a fuel cell include two electrodes\u2014an anode and a cathode\u2014and an intervening electrolyte (refer to Figure 33a). At the anode, H2 fuel undergoes a chemical reaction that separates it into positively charged H2 ions (protons) and negatively charged electrons. The electrolyte allows only the protons to pass through to the cathode, while the electrons are directed through an external circuit, generating an electric current. On reaching the cathode, the electrons, returning from the external circuit, combine with the protons that have passed through the electrolyte and with O2 from the air. This reaction produces water and heat as the only byproducts, making fuel cells an environmentally friendly technology. Seo et al. [253] used FSP to engineer Ce1\u2013xGdxO2\u2013x/2 nanoparticles for fuel cell electrolytes, pelletizing and sintering them at 1400 \u25e6C for 3 h. They observed that higher temperatures improved ionic conductivity due to increased oxide ion mobility. Their FSPderived nanoparticles demonstrated the highest conductivity, attributed to larger lattice constants. Lee and colleagues [254] found that incorporating catalysts into fuel cell electrodes, such as FSP-synthesized carbon-supported Pt-Ru (refer to Figure 33d), not only lowers operating temperature but also mitigates CO poisoning. Their study revealed that these flame-made materials exhibited superior methanol oxidation and CO stripping capabilities (see Figure 33b,c), along with competitive electrochemical activity, outperforming commercial catalysts of the same composition in fuel cell performance [254].

Among different technologies, rechargeable Li-ion batteries stand out for their high energy density and lifespan [257]. These batteries consist of an anode, cathode, and a separator soaked in an electrolyte, with Li-ions moving between the anode and cathode during charge and discharge cycles (Figure 33e). Traditionally made through solid-state or sol-gel methods, Li-ion batteries often face challenges like lengthy production times, multiple steps, and impurity presence. Therefore, numerous studies are focusing on enhancing the fabrication of materials and assembly of electrodes, crucial for battery performance. Gockeln et al. [256] utilized FSP for the direct fabrication of Li4Ti4O12 (LTO) batteries on flexible polyimide foil (refer to Figure 33f\u2013i). They noticed a potential plateau deviation and shortening at higher current densities, linked to cell polarization under these conditions. Additionally, they explored the performance of in situ-coated nano LTO/C batteries made via a combination of FSP and pressure-based lamination. They observed a stable voltage plateau at discharge rates up to 1 \u25e6C, suggesting enhanced charge/discharge reaction kinetics due to improved electronic conductivity in the microstructure."

            "text": "Flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) is a highly potent technology for the synthesis of advanced nanostructures. While FSP has achieved significant milestones, both in terms of material variety and process optimization, the journey toward its full potential is ongoing. So far, FSP has produced more than 500 different materials, and it is widely used in academia (more than 30 groups working with FSP), adapted by industry (officially Johnson Matthey has announced the use of an FSP facility), and the largest public reactor installed in Spain (http://www.advance-fsp.eu/, accessed on 5 November 2023) producing several kilograms/day. The future prospect lies in designing such high-enthalpy spray combinations using economic metal salts (nitrates, chlorides, acetates) that react with the solvent producing in situ metal alkoxides opening the door toward easily available wide range of inexpensive precursors. Diligent control of FSP parameters allows for targeted manipulation of nanoparticle characteristics, which is essential for catalyst optimization. These parameters, including flame temperature and precursor feed rate, significantly affect the size and shape of nanoparticles, thereby directly impacting their catalytic activity. Smaller particles, due to their greater surface areas, exhibit higher activity because of the increased number of active sites. FSP also facilitates the synthesis of tailored composite or doped nanoparticles, offering precise control over their composition and dopant distribution, which enhances activity and selectivity. The high temperature conditions in FSP enable the production of high-purity, crystalline nanoparticles, crucial for ensuring catalyst stability and conductivity. Additionally, surface properties, which are vital in electrocatalysis, can be modified through the adjustment of FSP\u2019s quenching rate and atmosphere, influencing surface defects and functionalities. Finally, managing nanoparticle agglomeration through FSP is\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 58 of 68\nkey; reducing agglomeration helps maintain an effective surface area, thereby improving electrocatalyst performance. Incorporating automation and advanced process control through the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning promises enhanced consistency and quality in nanoparticle synthesis. These technologies, in conjunction with sophisticated sensors, enable real-time data acquisition and dynamic optimization of the FSP process. Concurrently, the development of in situ characterization techniques during FSP synthesis offers deeper insights into nanostructure formation mechanisms, thereby facilitating a more exacting command over the synthesis process. Despite this broad range of benefit and potential, the use of FSP synthesis for the integration of nanocomponents in devices still faces some challenges. Among those, the large amount of nanomaterial produced in the aerosol phase, the need to manage large gas volumes, and high temperatures make the integration of flame reactors in clean rooms and standard nanofabrication facilities difficult. The intrinsic very high porosity of aerosol self-assembled nanoparticle films at low temperature makes them fragile and prevents the use of such films in a liquid environment. Sufficient in situ sintering of the layers during deposition is not always possible for materials having low sintering rates and for substrates not able to withstand sufficiently high temperatures. Innovations are required in the design of flame-assisted synthesis to overcome these challenges and establish it as a standard fabrication route for the integration of nanomaterials in a variety of devices and applications. As a forward-looking summary, several focal points emerge:\n(a) Multifunctionality Enhancement: As the title of this review suggests, multifunctionality is at the heart of FSP\u2019s premise. Future advancements should emphasize developing processes that can fabricate nanostructures with an even broader range of functionalities, expanding their utility across diverse sectors. There is growing interest in the development of hybrid versions of FSP that incorporate additional physical processes, such as electric fields or ultrasound [258,259]. The integration of an electric field into the FSP process, for instance, could offer enhanced control over particle formation. By applying an electric field, it is possible to influence the charge distribution within the flame, potentially leading to more uniform particle sizes and shapes. (b) Technological Synergies: Harnessing the potential of complementary technologies, like AI and real-time monitoring tools, will trigger the era of \u201csmart\u201d FSP [260]. This would not only ensure the efficient production of desired nanostructures but might also open doors to materials previously deemed unattainable. (c) Economic Precursor Development: As FSP broadens its reach, the use of economical and readily available precursors will be essential. Research geared toward identifying and harnessing such materials will significantly reduce production costs, making FSP-synthesized nanoparticles more accessible. (d) Challenge Mitigation: While the review refers to the advancements, it is vital not to overlook the inherent challenges of FSP, be it in scalability, integration with standard fabrication environments, or ensuring the robustness of the nanostructures. Innovations addressing these challenges head-on will be instrumental in FSP\u2019s widespread adoption. (e) Expanding Application Horizons: While FSP-derived nanoparticles have found their place in various applications, constant research is required to explore untapped potentials. Fields such as renewable energy, biomedicine, and advanced electronics may witness revolutionary products birthed from FSP advancements. Integrating biological components, such as enzymes or other organic molecules, into the FSP process might enable the synthesis of bio-functionalized nanoparticles. These could have specific applications in targeted drug delivery, biosensors, or bio-catalysis. (f) Environmental and Safety Concerns: As with all industrial processes, the environmental impact of FSP, along with safety concerns, will need continuous evaluation. Future iterations of FSP should aim for greener processes, ensuring sustainability.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 3006 59 of 68\nIn summary, FSP technology is poised to play a pivotal role in the next wave of nanotechnological innovations.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing\u2014original draft preparation, C.D., P.P. and M.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, C.D., P.P. and M.S.; supervision, Y.D.; project administration, Y.D.
