    "abstractText": "In the context of global demand for carbon reduction, the formation of inorganic carbon (IC) in the wastewater from oil flooding becomes a potential threat. In this study, Chlorella sp. and Fusarium sp. were used to assemble a fungal-algal pellet to degrade polyacrylamide (PAM) and fix IC in synthetic oil-flooding wastewater. The results showed that the combination of Chlorella sp. and Fusarium sp. was more effective at degrading PAM and removing carbon than a monoculture. With PAM as the sole nitrogen source, the degradation of PAM by the consortium was enhanced up to 35.17 \u00b1 0.86% and 21.63 \u00b1 2.23% compared with the monocultures of fungi or microalgae, respectively. The degradation of the consortium was significantly enhanced by the addition of an external nitrogen source by up to 27.17 \u00b1 2.27% and 22.86 \u00b1 2.4% compared with the monoculture of fungi or microalgae, respectively. This may depend on the effect of synergy between the two species. For the removal of IC from the water, the removal efficiency of the consortium was higher than that of the microalgae by 38.5 \u00b1 0.08%, which may be attributed to the ability of the fungi to aid in the adsorption of nutrients and its assimilation by the microalgae. Therefore, the Fusarium-Chlorella consortium can effectively degrade PAM, while simultaneously fixing carbon, which provides a feasible scheme for the treatment and carbon neutralization of the wastewater that contains PAM.",

In this study, Chlorella sp. and Fusarium sp. were used to assemble a fungal-algal pellet to degrade polyacrylamide (PAM) and fix IC in synthetic oil-flooding wastewater. The results showed that the combination of Chlorella sp. and Fusarium sp. was more effective at degrading PAM and removing carbon than a monoculture. With PAM as the sole nitrogen source, the degradation of PAM by the consortium was enhanced up to 35.17 \u00b1 0.86% and 21.63 \u00b1 2.23% compared with the monocultures of fungi or microalgae, respectively. The degradation of the consortium was significantly enhanced by the addition of an external nitrogen source by up to 27.17 \u00b1 2.27% and 22.86 \u00b1 2.4% compared with the monoculture of fungi or microalgae, respectively. This may depend on the effect of synergy between the two species. For the removal of IC from the water, the removal efficiency of the consortium was higher than that of the microalgae by 38.5 \u00b1 0.08%, which may be\u00a0attributed to the ability of the fungi to aid in the adsorption of nutrients and its assimilation by the microalgae. Therefore, the Fusarium-Chlorella consortium can effectively degrade PAM, while simultaneously fixing carbon, which provides a feasible scheme for the treatment and carbon neutralization of the wastewater that contains PAM.\nKEYWORDS\nFusarium sp., Chlorella sp., mycelial pellets, fungal-microalgal consortium, polyacrylamide removal\n1. Introduction\nPolyacrylamide (PAM) is primarily used in the process of alkali/polymer/surfactant flooding, which results in a large amount of wastewater that contains a concentration of 300\u2013800 mg/L PAM (Song et\u00a0al., 2021). PAM can be\u00a0hydrolyzed to form toxic acrylamide monomers, which have been shown to damage the nervous system of humans and animals (Albalawi et\u00a0al., 2018). Furthermore, the carbon dioxide (CO2) in the formation is dissolved into the flooding water to form dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with a CO2 equivalent of 3 to 4 kg/ m3. The excessive emissions of CO2 that cause the greenhouse effect have attracted global attention (Modak et\u00a0al., 2018). Oversaturated CO2 in the water poses the risk of escaping into"

Therefore, it is highly necessary to remove the PAM and DIC before the flooding wastewater is discharged.\nThe current research hotspots on the biodegradation of PAM primarily include two aspects. The first is the use of anaerobic, aerobic or anaerobic-aerobic combination bioreactors to treat PAM, such as sequencing batch reactor (SBR) systems, alkaline pre-fermentation for anaerobic digestion and anaerobic digestion under mesophilic conditions (Liu et\u00a0al., 2021). Secondly, whether the bacterial strains are used individually or in combination to degrade PAM. In terms of its molecular structure, PAM is composed of main carbon chains and side chain amide groups. The mineralization of PAM requires the degradation of both the main carbon chain and side chain amide groups. Amidases can help microorganisms to degrade amide groups by catalyzing the hydrolysis of amide bonds to form ammonia and carboxylic acids, and these enzymes are produced by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, and algae. Numerous studies have investigated the biodegradation of PAM by bacterial strains, such as Bacillus sp. (Nyyss\u00f6l\u00e4 and Ahlgren, 2019), Acinetobacter sp. (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2021) and Clostridium sp. (Ma et\u00a0 al., 2010), but to our knowledge, the feasibility of the degradation of PAM by single algae species has not been reported. Similarly, previous studies have shown that the long carbon chains of PAM can be\u00a0degraded by bacteria. Although there have been few studies on the degradation of long carbon chains of PAM by fungi, these microbes have a strong ability to degrade other complex carbon compounds, including crude oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Zain Ul Arifeen et\u00a0 al., 2022; Saravanan et\u00a0al., 2023).\nCurrently, the pollutants in oil flooding wastewater are not limited to PAM but also include soluble inorganic carbon (IC). In previous studies, microalgae have been shown to have a superior ability to remove DIC. Both small and large algae can utilize carbonic anhydrase (CA) to metabolize IC (Vyrides et\u00a0al., 2018; Thanigaivel et\u00a0al., 2022). Furthermore, several microalgal species have been found to secrete amidases, including Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus obliquus, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Dunaliella salina, and Nannochloropsis oceanica (Sheng et\u00a0 al., 2022). A fungal-algal particle system is an emerging microbial water treatment technology in which mycelial particles are used as special biological carriers to load algae and then used as microbial materials to treat water. Due to the high efficiency and safety of microbial technology, as well as the resistance to impact and stability of biological materials, it is gradually attracting the attention of researchers (Du et\u00a0al., 2018; Ma et\u00a0al., 2021; Li et\u00a0al., 2023). Many researchers have also proven that fungal-algal pellets are highly efficient at treating organic wastewater (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2018; Chen et\u00a0al., 2020). However, few studies have investigated the removal of PAM-containing wastewater using fungi either alone or in a fungalmicroalgal consortium.\nIn this study, Fusarium sp. was obtained by screening strains. Subsequently, Fusarium sp. and Chlorella sp. were co-cultured to form a Fusarium-Chlorella consortium. Based on the advantages of microalgae in wastewater treatment described above, this study investigated the differences in the efficiency of pollutant degradation among three different biological systems: single Fusarium sp. mycelial pellets, single Chlorella sp. and the Fusarium-Chlorella consortium in treating synthetic wastewater, as well as whether the addition of\nnitrogen sources for co-metabolism could enhance the ability of the three biological systems to degrade organic wastewater."

The preliminary experiments revealed that the stability and biomass of the spheres formed by the inoculation of mycelia were higher than those formed by the inoculation of mycelial spheres that had already formed, and therefore, mycelia were inoculated into the microalgae to form the consortium used in this study. The fungal mycelia can potentially combine with the microalgae through rotation, entanglement, and adsorption to ultimately form a sphere, which resulted in a significant decrease in the microalgal biomass. Therefore, to ensure that the consortium can bind enough microalgal cells, the microalgae were first cultured to achieve a high OD value (OD660 = 0.8).\nTo establish whether the synergistic treatment effect of the microbial consortium on the wastewater that contained PAM was better than that of single fungal or microalgal systems, single system\nFrontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.org\ntreatment experiments were conducted to compare the degradation by the three systems under the same culture conditions."

The sample was added dropwise to a large excess of methanol, which caused the residual polymer in the sample to precipitate. The precipitated polymer was then filtered and washed twice with methanol before it was dried to a constant weight using a vacuum freeze dryer (SCIENTZ-18ND/A; Scientz Bio-Technology, Ningbo, China). After preparation, these samples were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) (Thermo Nicolet, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United\u00a0States).\nUsing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), a statistical analysis was performed on the rates of degradation of PAM to determine significant differences (p < 0.05) among the three biological systems. The minimum significant difference between each pair of means was calculated.\nThe characterization was performed by analyzing the 18S rRNA genes. The genomic DNA was extracted by collecting the cell precipitates from the original sample using a commercial DNA extraction kit (TGuide OSR-M502, TIANGEN Biotech, Beijing, China). The PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 \u03bcL that contained 25 \u03bcL polymerase premix (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan), 1 \u03bcL DNA, 22 \u03bcL double-distilled H2O, and 1 \u03bcL each of the forward and reverse primers.

Fungi have mycelia, which use a process of winding and adsorption to form stable mycelial pellets in culture (Figure\u00a0 1A). Compared with the use of single microbial strains to remove pollutants, the morphology and large specific surface area of the mycelial pellets enables greater contact and assimilation of the pollutants in wastewater (Li et\u00a0 al., 2023). More importantly, the formation of mycelial pellets is more conducive to the rapid separation of organisms and wastewater, which facilitates the reuse of microorganisms (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2018). On this basis, the Fusarium mycelial pellet was used to package suspended algal cells, which consisted of the Fusarium mycelial pellet, and can effectively improve the ability to separate the algal cells and solution to achieve the goal of reusing them (Chen et\u00a0al., 2020)."

The degradation of PAM was significantly affected by the addition of different co-metabolic nitrogen sources within 10 days of the completion of culture cycle (Figure\u00a01B). The rate of degradation of PAM was the highest in the experimental group with added urea, which reached 53.76 \u00b1 2.97%, and corresponded to a reduction in the concentration of PAM by approximately 200 mg/L. The rate of degradation of PAM reached 49.88 \u00b1 3.2% in the experimental group with the addition of NH4Cl and 46.69 \u00b1 0.57% with the addition of yeast extract, while only 26.74 \u00b1 1.46% of the PAM was degraded when PAM was used as the sole nitrogen source.\nA previous study showed that the process of PAM biodegradation begins with deamination by amidase catalysis (Nyyss\u00f6l\u00e4 and Ahlgren, 2019). As a polymeric compound, PAM cannot enter the intracellular portion of the Fusarium sp. cells through biofilms (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, when PAM is used as the sole source of nitrogen, Fusarium sp. cannot secrete many extracellular enzymes for a short time, thus, the efficiency of PAM degradation was the lowest. Furthermore, the addition of co-metabolic nitrogen sources could ensure the rapid growth of biomass, which results in the secretion of more extracellular amidase, thereby effectively improving the degradation of PAM. Therefore, the addition of a co-metabolic nitrogen source can promote the secretion of extracellular amidase, thereby improving the\nFrontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org\nrate of degradation of PAM to some extent. The addition of urea promotes the secretion of extracellular amidase enzymes by Fusarium sp. and improves the rate of degradation of PAM, which is consistent with the findings of a previous study (Bao et\u00a0al., 2010)."

The TOC removal efficiency in the other three groups was only approximately 10%. Compared with the other three nitrogen sources, yeast extract contains not only nitrogen but also many trace elements and growth factors, such as nucleosides and amino acids among others. It is hypothesized that these growth factors and trace elements are more conducive to the growth of fungi, which facilitates the synergistic degradation of PAM.\n3.2. Performance of Chlorella sp. at treating synthetic flooding wastewater\n3.2.1. Growth curve of Chlorella sp. in the synthetic flooding wastewater\nThe change in algal biomass during the 6 days incubation period is shown in Figure\u00a02A. Algal cultures exhibited significant growth\nwhen different co-metabolic nitrogen sources were added and reached a stable biomass until approximately 5 days before they started to decline.\n3.2.2. Ability of Chlorella sp. to degrade PAM in the synthetic flooding wastewater\nThe degradation of PAM by Chlorella sp. was also affected by the addition of a co-metabolic nitrogen source (Figure\u00a02B). The rate of degradation of PAM reached 58.07 \u00b1 3.1% when supplemented with NH4Cl, 48.11 \u00b1 1.05% when supplemented with yeast extract, 38.2 \u00b1 0.27% when supplemented with urea and 40.28 \u00b1 2.83% when PAM was used as the sole nitrogen source. To remove the organic nitrogen, algae first degraded it into ammonia using various enzymes, which enables it to then be\u00a0absorbed by the algal cells (Simsek et\u00a0al., 2016). These results indicate that the algae Chlorella sp. had a stronger ability to utilize inorganic nitrogen sources than those of organic nitrogen, although the degradation of PAM was effectively promoted by the addition of an external nitrogen source, regardless of whether it was organic or inorganic.\n3.2.3. Ability of Chlorella sp. to remove TOC and IC in the synthetic flooding wastewater\nThe ability of Chlorella sp. to remove TOC was significantly reduced during the 6 days culture cycle (Figure\u00a02C).

This result shows that the\nFIGURE\u00a01 Fusarium mycelial pellet morphology (A) and its ability to remove PAM and TOC (B) PAM and (C) TOC. PAM, polyacrylamide; TOC, total organic carbon.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.org\nmicroalgae were more effective at degrading TOC when adequate nutrients were available. However, as the experimental period extended, the organic matter generated by microalgal physiological activity accumulated, which led to a potential decrease in the efficiency of TOC removal and an increase in the levels of TOC.\nDuring the culture period, Chlorella sp. was highly efficient at removing the IC from wastewater that contained PAM (Figure\u00a02D). Approximately 90% of the IC was removed, which confirmed the suitability of the system for carbon sequestration. The efficiency of the IC removal was 42.97 \u00b1 0.74% when the system was supplemented with urea, 85.28 \u00b1 1.05% when supplemented with NH4Cl, 79.14 \u00b1 0.02% when supplemented with yeast extract and 82.62 \u00b1 1.09% when PAM was used as the sole nitrogen source. This result also corresponds to a previous study that showed that microalgae are highly effective at fixing IC (Saravanan et\u00a0al., 2022).\nChlorella can use both organic and IC sources (Nasir et\u00a0al., 2015). A comparison of Figures\u00a02C,D shows that when urea and yeast extract were used as co-metabolic nitrogen sources, the organic carbon in them could be\u00a0utilized by Chlorella, thereby reducing the fixation of DIC in solution. Therefore, when urea and yeast extract were used as co-metabolic nitrogen sources, the TOC was removed when both nitrogen sources were used, but there was little removal of DIC. With ammonium chloride as a common metabolic nitrogen source and\nPAM as the only nitrogen source, there was little TOC in the system; Chlorella had to use DIC for growth, and during the process of growth, it secretes extracellular polymers, such as polysaccharides and proteins among others (Zhu et\u00a0al., 2012). As a result, the two groups of TOC were negative, but the efficiency of the DIC fixed was positive.\n3.3.

Microalgae are mostly adsorbed onto the surface of mycelial pellets, while only a small number of microalgal cells exist within the internal structure of the fungal-microalgal consortium pellets (Figure\u00a03A). This was consistent with the findings of previous research (Leng et\u00a0al., 2021). The ratio of microalgae to fungi was 2:1. The final consortium sphere that was formed adsorbed a large number of microalgal cells with a dense and stable structure that exhibited\nFIGURE\u00a02 Growth curve of Chlorella sp.

This is advantageous for the subsequent harvesting of the algal biomass. The consortium was subjected to stability experiments in a gas column with an aeration rate of 135 L/min, and the consortium could remain stable without disintegrating for 48 h.\n3.3.2. Ability of the Fusarium-Chlorella consortium to degrade PAM\nThe results described above showed that both algae and fungi could degrade PAM separately, and the performance of the FusariumChlorella consortium at degrading PAM was higher than the performance of single systems (Figure\u00a03B). The rate of degradation of PAM reached 80.93 \u00b1 0.7% when the system was supplemented with urea, 65.27 \u00b1 1.32% when supplemented with NH4Cl, 45.88 \u00b1 3.48% when supplemented with yeast extract and 61.91 \u00b1 0.6% when PAM was used as the sole nitrogen source. Overall, the concentration of PAM decreased significantly, and the rate of degradation reached 80%, which indicated that the Fusarium-Chlorella consortium had a significant effect on the degradation of PAM. Previous studies have shown that fungal-microalgal consortia have been widely used in wastewater treatment (Muradov et\u00a0al., 2015), and the results of this study confirmed that the microbial consortium was highly adaptable\nto wastewater that contained PAM, which made it suitable for use in conditions where PAM is the sole nitrogen source available for growth.\n3.3.3. Ability of the Fusarium-Chlorella consortium to remove TOC and IC\nThe ability of the Fusarium-Chlorella consortium to remove TOC clearly differed when cultured with different co-metabolic nitrogen sources (Figure\u00a03C). The rate of TOC removal reached 39.9 \u00b1 0.41% when supplemented with urea, 3.56 \u00b1 2.72% when supplemented with NH4Cl, 51.58 \u00b1 1.05% when supplemented with yeast extract and \u22124.4 \u00b1 3.0% when PAM was used as the sole source of nitrogen. Therefore, the experimental groups supplemented with organic nitrogen sources provided another source of TOC in addition to PAM, which resulted in a significant decrease in the concentration of TOC. This may be\u00a0due to the full utilization of additional sources of organic nitrogen. However, in the experimental groups where the inorganic nitrogen sources were supplemented or PAM was used as the sole nitrogen source, the concentration of TOC remained relatively stable with no significant changes observed. This may be\u00a0attributed to the accumulation of some organic compounds that resulted from microbial metabolism during the cultivation period that were not utilized.\nFIGURE\u00a03 Fusarium-Chlorella consortium morphology (A) and its ability to remove (B) PAM, (C) TOC and (D) IC. IC, inorganic carbon; PAM, polyacrylamide; TOC, total organic carbon.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 07 frontiersin.org\nThe degradation of IC by the Fusarium-Chlorella consortium over the 6 days culture period is shown in Figure\u00a03D. The rate of IC removal reached 68.83 \u00b1 1.32% in the group supplemented with urea, 93.58 \u00b1 0.06% when supplemented with NH4Cl, 93.48 \u00b1 0.27% when supplemented with yeast extract and 88.97 \u00b1 0.36% when PAM was used as the sole nitrogen source. Overall, the synergistic performance of the Fusarium-Chlorella consortium to treat IC was better than that of the single Chlorella sp. system with the ability to sequester carbon providing obvious advantages. These findings prove that the mechanisms of biodegradation by microalgae and fungi have synergistic effects, which results in their effective combination for wastewater treatment (Wang et\u00a0al., 2022).\nAn analysis of the differences in the degradation efficiency of PAM among three different biological systems that did not include co-metabolic nitrogen sources was conducted. The results demonstrated a significant difference (p = 0.003) in the degradation capability among the three systems. This indicates that different biological systems exhibit significantly different abilities to degrade PAM, and the efficiency of the consortium to degrade PAM is significantly higher than that of a single system.\nAccording to China\u2019s Petrochemical Pollutant Discharge Standard (GB31570-2015, China), the concentrations of PAM and IC in effluent are not clearly required, while the relevant stipulated parameter is the chemical oxygen demand (COD). In the GB315702015, the COD discharge standard in oil flooding wastewater requires less than 100 mg/L. The COD values of the simulated flooding wastewater treated by mycelia were usually between 150 mg/L and 200 mg/L, which cannot directly reach the standard. However, in practical applications, oil flooding wastewater is treated by combining a variety of treatment processes, such as anaerobic baffled treatment process and aerobic biofilm treatment process among others (Sang et\u00a0al., 2015; Song et\u00a0al., 2018, 2019). In practice, the mycelial pellet can be\u00a0 combined with various processes to successfully process the DIC."

The peaks observed at 1115, 1616, 1,666 and 3,200 cm\u22121 in the spectrum of PAM corresponded to the existence of C\u2013N, N\u2013H, C=O bonds and amide groups (Bao et\u00a0al., 2010; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2019).\nA comparison of the FT-IR spectra for all three samples showed that the peaks that represented the C\u2013N bonds, N\u2013H bonds, C=O bonds and -NH2 gradually disappeared, indicating that the side chains and amide groups of PAM were degraded. Furthermore, the peak that represented methylene at 1456 cm\u22121 also gradually disappeared, indicating that the carbon backbone of PAM was also degraded. Furthermore, upon comparing the spectra of the three samples between 3,100 cm\u22121 and 3,500 cm\u22121, it was observed that the peaks had become wider. This indicated that the amide group had degraded into a carboxyl group (Bao et\u00a0al., 2010). In comparison to the PAM degradation effects of high temperature sterilization and biodegradation, it was apparent\nthat high temperature sterilization has some effect at degrading PAM, and the subsequent biodegradation fully degraded the PAM."

            "text": "Based on the studies described above, three possible mechanisms for the removal of PAM, as well as that of the IC, by the biological systems were initially proposed.\nWhen the experimental group without the use of additional nitrogen sources was used as an example, according to the metabolic pathway proposed in a previous study (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2019) and the FT-IR results described above, the side chains of PAM were cleaved, which may be\u00a0due to the role of extracellular amidases secreted by the microalgae and fungi to convert the amide group to carboxylate group; however, there was no carboxylate group that bound intramolecularly, which was slightly different from the findings of previous studies (Sang et\u00a0al., 2015). Alternatively, it also proved that the microorganisms in this study could grow using PAM as the sole nitrogen source. In addition, the biomass still grew without the addition of an organic nitrogen source, and the FT-IR results showed that the main carbon chain of PAM was cleaved, which might be\u00a0the result of the catalytic degradation of this carbon chain of PAM by a monooxygenase secreted by the microorganisms (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2019). It also showed that PAM can be\u00a0used as the sole source of carbon for microbial growth.\nTo remove the IC, we\u00a0primarily rely on the biological fixation of IC by the microalgae in soluble carbonate compounds, such as NaHCO3 (Molazadeh et\u00a0al., 2019). Research has shown that microalgae primarily use CA to metabolize IC (Thanigaivel et\u00a0al., 2022). In the Calvin cycle, microalgae absorb CO2 and synthesize organic compounds to fix CO2, and when the CO2 dissolves, it converts the carbon into various forms of IC, thereby enabling the microalgae to remove the IC."

The removal effect of the Fusarium-Chlorella consortium for PAM and IC was much better than that of the two separate culture systems, and the efficiency of degradation of the pollutants could be\u00a0 significantly improved by the addition of an additional nitrogen source.
