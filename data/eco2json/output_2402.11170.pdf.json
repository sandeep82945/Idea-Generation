    "abstractText": "Ethereum 2.0, as the preeminent smart contract blockchain platform, guarantees the precise execution of applications without third-party intervention. At its core, this system leverages the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which utilizes a stochastic process to select validators for block proposal and validation, consequently rewarding them for their contributions. However, the implementation of blockchain technology often diverges from its central tenet of decentralized consensus, presenting significant analytical challenges. Our study collects consensus reward data from the Ethereum Beacon chain and conducts a comprehensive analysis of reward distribution and evolution, categorizing them into attestation, proposer and sync committee rewards. To evaluate the degree of decentralization in PoS Ethereum, we apply several inequality indices, including the Shannon entropy, the Gini Index, the Nakamoto Coefficient, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). Our comprehensive dataset is publicly available on Harvard Dataverse, and our analytical methodologies are accessible via GitHub, promoting open-access research. Additionally, we provide insights on utilizing our data for future investigations focused on assessing, augmenting, and refining the decentralization, security, and efficiency of blockchain systems. 1 Background & Summary Blockchain technology, designed to catalyze a shift towards a decentralized and equitable digital ecosystem, sets the stage for significant advancements like Ethereum 2.0. The introduction of Ethereum 2.0 signifies a transformative development in the realm of blockchain technology, marking a departure from the established Proof-of-Work (PoW) to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.1, 2 This transition, which took place on September 15, 2022, not only aims to mitigate the environmental and scalability challenges inherent in PoW but also ushers in a novel approach to reward distribution that prioritizes staking Ether over computational exertion. Previous studies have underscored significant variations in reward distribution among different blockchain networks, such as Cardano,3 and Bitcoin,4, 5 sparking debates over the potential concentration of wealth and authority. 6\u201310 Against this backdrop, the PoS iteration of Ethereum offers an invaluable opportunity to investigate whether this paradigm shift could lead to a more equitable allocation of rewards, challenging the centralization trends noted in PoW frameworks. Notwithstanding the significance of this investigation, there is a noticeable scarcity of detailed, accessible data on reward distribution within the PoS domain of Ethereum. Our study seeks to bridge this gap by formulating a comprehensive methodology for accruing reward data from the Ethereum Beacon chain, with the goal of evaluating the degree of decentralization in this emergent ecosystem. By implementing Ethereum Erigon and Teku nodes to harvest data from the Beacon chain and employing a variety of inequality indices to scrutinize the decentralization of reward allocation, our research sheds light on the distribution patterns of rewards among validators in Ethereum 2.0, suggesting a progression towards a more decentralized reward framework. Our paper has three main contributions, which are as follows: ar X iv :2 40 2. 11 17 0v 1 [ ec on .G N ] 1 7 Fe b 20 24 Component Specification CPU 128 cores Memory 512 GB Storage 10 TB Operating System Debian 5.10.162-1 Table 1. Experiment setting 1. We have developed a comprehensive and systematic methodology for the collection of Ethereum\u2019s reward data specific to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) phase. This dataset, significant for its relevance and scope, has been made publicly accessible to facilitate and encourage further scholarly research. 2. Through our detailed analysis of the reward distribution in Ethereum\u2019s PoS phase, employing a range of sophisticated inequality metrics, we have identified a notable reduction in the disparity of rewards in terms of the values of inequality metrics. This finding is pivotal in understanding the economic dynamics of the PoS system. 3. Our dataset lends itself to a variety of analytical applications, encompassing not only time-series analysis but also an exploration of inter-layer blockchain decentralization. Furthermore, it provides a foundation for a comparative analysis of reward distributions between PoS and PoW blockchain architectures, offering critical insights into the evolving landscape of blockchain technology. To our knowledge, this is the first study to scrutinize the decentralization in Ethereum\u2019s PoS reward distribution using inequality metrics. While previous studies have delved into the decentralization of wealth in blockchain systems like Cardano, Bitcoin, and PoW Ethereum,11 our focus is on Ethereum PoS, thus providing fresh insights into its reward dynamics. The organization of this manuscript is methodically outlined as follows: Section 2 elucidates our research methodology, encompassing the deployment of archive nodes, a detailed analysis of consensus rewards, reward dynamics after the Merge, and the application of various inequality metrics. Section 3 systematically presents the data record. In Section 4, we undertake a technical validation of our methodology, contrasting it with additional data sources for robustness. Section 5 delves into the potential applications of our datasets, highlighting their versatility and scope. Finally, Section 6 details the accessibility of our open-source code, underlining our commitment to transparency and collaborative research. 2 Methods In this section, we present the data engineering workflow, exemplified in Figure 1. Deployment of Archive Node for Blockchain Data Collection To acquire data for Ethereum 2.0, we deployed consensus and execution nodes, utilizing the Teku1 and Erigon2 clients3 respectively on the Linux server, we show the experiment setting in Table 1. Subsequently, after synchronizing the block data, we employed the Web3.py Python library and the API of the Teku node to collect reward data. The rewards are categorized into three main types: proposer reward, attestation reward, and sync committee reward. Notably, the attestation reward is updated per epoch. Each epoch can encompass hundreds of thousands of validators, leading to a substantial volume of data. We collected data for a duration of two months after the Ethereum PoS transition, resulting in a total dataset size of 173.8 GB, with attestation reward data constituting 167 GB. All the rewards data obtained are in Gwei, which is equivalent to 10\u22129 Ether, we convert the rewards from Gwei to Ether in our analysis. Decomposition of Validator and Beacon Rewards by Sources The Ethereum 2.0 protocol incorporates a multifaceted reward system designed to incentivize validators across various dimensions of system participation and security. Notably, these rewards can be categorized into two primary sources: those originating from the consensus layer (Beacon chain) and those from the execution layer. Within the Beacon chain, rewards are issued to validators in recognition of their pivotal role in the consensus mechanism, which stands as a cornerstone for the network\u2019s security and resilience. In contrast, the execution layer introduces two distinct types of rewards: 1https://github.com/Consensys/teku 2https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon 3For information on Ethereum blockchain nodes and clients, please refer to https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/ nodes-and-clients/",

At its core, this system leverages the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which utilizes a stochastic process to select validators for block proposal and validation, consequently rewarding them for their contributions. However, the implementation of blockchain technology often diverges from its central tenet of decentralized consensus, presenting significant analytical challenges. Our study collects consensus reward data from the Ethereum Beacon chain and conducts a comprehensive analysis of reward distribution and evolution, categorizing them into attestation, proposer and sync committee rewards. To evaluate the degree of decentralization in PoS Ethereum, we apply several inequality indices, including the Shannon entropy, the Gini Index, the Nakamoto Coefficient, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). Our comprehensive dataset is publicly available on Harvard Dataverse, and our analytical methodologies are accessible via GitHub, promoting open-access research.

            "text": "Blockchain technology, designed to catalyze a shift towards a decentralized and equitable digital ecosystem, sets the stage for significant advancements like Ethereum 2.0. The introduction of Ethereum 2.0 signifies a transformative development in the realm of blockchain technology, marking a departure from the established Proof-of-Work (PoW) to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.1, 2 This transition, which took place on September 15, 2022, not only aims to mitigate the environmental and scalability challenges inherent in PoW but also ushers in a novel approach to reward distribution that prioritizes staking Ether over computational exertion. Previous studies have underscored significant variations in reward distribution among different blockchain networks, such as Cardano,3 and Bitcoin,4, 5 sparking debates over the potential concentration of wealth and authority. 6\u201310 Against this backdrop, the PoS iteration of Ethereum offers an invaluable opportunity to investigate whether this paradigm shift could lead to a more equitable allocation of rewards, challenging the centralization trends noted in PoW frameworks.\nNotwithstanding the significance of this investigation, there is a noticeable scarcity of detailed, accessible data on reward distribution within the PoS domain of Ethereum. Our study seeks to bridge this gap by formulating a comprehensive methodology for accruing reward data from the Ethereum Beacon chain, with the goal of evaluating the degree of decentralization in this emergent ecosystem. By implementing Ethereum Erigon and Teku nodes to harvest data from the Beacon chain and employing a variety of inequality indices to scrutinize the decentralization of reward allocation, our research sheds light on the distribution patterns of rewards among validators in Ethereum 2.0, suggesting a progression towards a more decentralized reward framework.\nOur paper has three main contributions, which are as follows:\nar X\niv :2\n40 2.\n11 17\n0v 1\n[ ec\non .G\nN ]\n1. We have developed a comprehensive and systematic methodology for the collection of Ethereum\u2019s reward data specific to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) phase. This dataset, significant for its relevance and scope, has been made publicly accessible to facilitate and encourage further scholarly research.\n2. Through our detailed analysis of the reward distribution in Ethereum\u2019s PoS phase, employing a range of sophisticated inequality metrics, we have identified a notable reduction in the disparity of rewards in terms of the values of inequality metrics. This finding is pivotal in understanding the economic dynamics of the PoS system.\n3. Our dataset lends itself to a variety of analytical applications, encompassing not only time-series analysis but also an exploration of inter-layer blockchain decentralization. Furthermore, it provides a foundation for a comparative analysis of reward distributions between PoS and PoW blockchain architectures, offering critical insights into the evolving landscape of blockchain technology.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to scrutinize the decentralization in Ethereum\u2019s PoS reward distribution using inequality metrics. While previous studies have delved into the decentralization of wealth in blockchain systems like Cardano, Bitcoin, and PoW Ethereum,11 our focus is on Ethereum PoS, thus providing fresh insights into its reward dynamics.\nThe organization of this manuscript is methodically outlined as follows: Section 2 elucidates our research methodology, encompassing the deployment of archive nodes, a detailed analysis of consensus rewards, reward dynamics after the Merge, and the application of various inequality metrics. Section 3 systematically presents the data record. In Section 4, we undertake a technical validation of our methodology, contrasting it with additional data sources for robustness. Section 5 delves into the potential applications of our datasets, highlighting their versatility and scope. Finally, Section 6 details the accessibility of our open-source code, underlining our commitment to transparency and collaborative research."

Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) Extraction: MEV is associated with the value that validators can extract from the ordering and inclusion of transactions within newly created blocks.13 Validators have the option to optimize this process by delegating such responsibilities to specialized agents within the ecosystem, such as Flashbots.14\nOur research focus revolves around a comprehensive examination of the reward mechanisms inherent to the consensus layer of the Beacon chain. Our primary objective is to illuminate its pivotal role in nurturing active participation and ensuring the long-term stability of the Ethereum network. It is of utmost importance to underscore that the rewards disbursed at the Beacon chain layer significantly contribute to the expansion of the monetary supply, denominated in Ether, within the system.\nValidators, entities holding stakes of 32 Ether within the Beacon chain contract4, receive rewards for engaging in three distinct roles within the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus process: attestors, block proposers, and members of the sync committee:\n1. Attestor are entitled to rewards for attesting to the following:5\n(a) Source: Voting in favor of a source checkpoint for Casper FFG.\n(b) Target: Voting in favor of a target checkpoint for Casper FFG.\n(c) Head: Voting for a chain head block for LMD-GHOST.\n2.

Proposer Slashing: Reporting a slashable violation by a proposer. ii. Attestor Slashing: Reporting a slashable violation by an attestor.\n3. Sync Committee Members play a pivotal role in assisting light clients in maintaining a synchronized record of Beacon block headers.\nThis categorization establishes the groundwork for an in-depth analysis of Ethereum 2.0\u2019s reward distribution mechanisms within its Beacon chain consensus layer.\n4https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa 5Refer to: https://eth2book.info/capella/\n3/12\nReward dynamics after the Merge 1. Daily reward evolution Figure 2 illustrates a time series of the rewards from September 16 to November 15, 2022.\nThe Figure shows the daily aggregated rewards on the Beacon chain, categorized into three distinct types as defined in Section 2. The blue line in Figure 2 represents the total daily rewards issued on the Beacon chain. Our analysis reveals a consistent trend in the daily issuance of rewards, with a slight upward trajectory over the period. Furthermore, Figure 2 offers insights into the allocation of rewards to validators for their duties. The majority of the rewards are attributed to attestation duties, which are the most frequent tasks performed once per epoch by each validator. This is followed by a significantly smaller portion allocated to proposer duties, and the smallest share comes from the participation in sync committees.\n2. Reward Distribution Figure 3 shows histograms of the (daily) aggregated rewards, split into the total reward and the three categories. Through four types of reward distribution, we can obtain fundamental knowledge about Beacon rewards. On average, 1660.1 Ether are generated daily on the Beacon chain. Out of this, 211.42 Ether are allocated to proposers, 1398.78 Ether are allocated to attestors, and 49.9 Ether are allocated to Sync committee members. Furthermore, the distributions expose a low dispersion, which is comparable among each of them. A different picture emerges, when looking at the single validators operating on the Beacon chain. Figure 4 shows the histograms of the income of validators (aggregated over the whole study period). On average, a validator can earn 0.25 Ether per day. A validator is frequently selected as an attestor, and can consistently earn around 0.2 Ether per day. If a validator is chosen as a proposer or a sync committee member, they will receive more rewards. The total reward is centered around a mean value, exhibiting a very low dispersion. This indicates that on a validator level rewards are distributed fairly. This distribution is an indication, that the protocol works as intended, no larger group of validators is able to extract substantially more rewards. Negative values are explained by validator being \u201dslashed\u201d for not conforming behavior. Finally, the bottom right panel of Figure 4 shows the rewards validators get from being a member on a Sync committee. As the probability of being part of a sync committee is very low, we can see that a large number of validators did not receive any rewards in this category.\n3. Validators Growth The left panel of Figure 5 shows how the number of active validators evolved during a period of two months. It steadily increased by around 5 percent during the whole period. The average reward of a single validator, as shown in the right panel of Figure 5, decreased slightly. The decrease in the average daily reward for a validator can be attributed to the slower pace of Ether issuance on the Beacon chain compared to the rate of validator growth. As additional validators are incorporated into the network, the mean reward allocated to each validator is expected to decline progressively."

            "text": "Asahi et al.(2021)4 conducted an investigation into the distribution of wealth in eight major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and the Proof-of-Work (PoW) Ethereum. Their findings revealed that, despite the purported emphasis on decentralization within various blockchain networks, wealth distribution remained unequal, with the notable exception of Dash coin. To\n4/12\nassess the decentralization of Ethereum 2.0, we employ several decentralization metrics as outlined in \"SoK: Blockchain Decentralization6.\" These metrics offer valuable insights into the concentration of rewards among different stakeholders. Definitions of the metrics are provided in Section A.\nThe first main observation from Figure 6 is that the distribution of total reward, attestor reward, and proposer reward in Ethereum 2.0 is relatively equal, as indicated by the Gini index being below 0.2 and the HHI index being very small. Additionally, the Shannon Entropy and Nakamoto index show high levels of diversity in rewards. A second crucial finding from the plot is that all metrics remain relatively stable over the chosen period, indicating a consistent level of decentralization over time. Moreover, there is a slight trend towards greater decentralization. The stability of these indices is a positive aspect, as it reaffirms that the design of Ethereum\u2019s PoS mechanism effectively prevents validators from becoming centralized at the validator level. Lastly, the reward distribution among sync committee members is neither equal nor stable, exhibiting periodicity. This discrepancy can be attributed to the mechanism described in Section 2 that the sync committee is only assigned every 256 epochs and comprises 512 validators."
