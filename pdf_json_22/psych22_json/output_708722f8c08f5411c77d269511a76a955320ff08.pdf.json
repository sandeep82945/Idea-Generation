    "abstractText": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental illness. This study used electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the effects of music therapy on brain networks in MDD patients and to elucidate changes in functional brain connectivity in subjects before and after musical stimulation. EEG signals were collected from eight MDD patients and eight healthy controls. The phase locking value was adopted to calculate the EEG correlation of different channels in different frequency bands. Correlation matrices and network topologies were studied to analyze changes in functional connectivity between brain regions. The results of the experimental analysis found that the connectivity of the delta and beta bands decreased, while the connectivity of the alpha band increased. Regarding the characteristics of the EEG functional network, the average clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and degree of each node in the delta band decreased significantly after musical stimulation, while the characteristic path length in the beta band increased significantly. Characterized by the average clustering coefficient and characteristic path length, the classification of depression and healthy controls reached 93.75% using a support vector machine.",

            "text": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common multidimensional disorder [1,2]. Symptoms often include lack of energy and loss of interest in life [3]. Compared with other diseases, MDD mainly impairs social cognitive function [4\u20136]. As a major worldwide disease, the treatment of MDD is usually divided into drug therapy and psychotherapy [7,8]. Although drugs are the main treatment for depression, 20% of patients cannot take them because of strong adverse drug reactions or psychological problems [9]. Psychotherapy as an alternative option, such as through music therapy, has been shown to significantly relieve depression in clinical studies [10]. Numerous studies have shown that the expression of music can improve the functioning of the nervous and endocrine systems [11,12]. At the same time, music therapy also provides patients with the opportunity to express their inner emotions through music, which can enable patients to obtain opportunities for self-expression through musical activities [13,14]. Therefore, musical stimulation therapy has been proven to be a new approach in the treatment of MDD patients, and the effect is widely recognized [15\u201317]. Music therapy is a great help in treating MDD [18\u201320], but the specific changes in brain connectivity that this treatment modifies are unknown. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive real-time neuroimaging technique. Benefiting from its high temporal resolution, EEG records electrical activity in relation to neuronal activity with excellent temporal resolution on the order of milliseconds. These advantages of EEG make it an irreplaceable technique when observing the brain [21]. EEG, combined with graph-theory-based network\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1680. https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12121680 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/brainsci\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1680 2 of 13\nanalysis, is gradually being used to explain the topology of brain networks and to analyze functional connections in the brain [22]. Functional connectivity (FC) is defined as the statistical interdependence between spatially distant neurophysiological regions, most commonly the correlation or coherence assessment between signals from pairs of electrodes [23]. FC provides a new approach to the rehabilitation of MDD patients [24]. Most of the research on MDD is based on non-invasive imaging, such as fMRI and EEG [25,26]. Signal features, including FC, are extracted by these techniques to understand data on normal or pathological brain states. EEG research focuses on MDD feature extraction and classification [27\u201329]. EEG-based signal feature extraction and classification of MDD patients focuses on the resting state or repetitive task state, which is different from the test state under natural conditions, as the world in which people live is changeable. As a part of daily entertainment, music can improve people\u2019s spiritual world, open closed hearts, and relieve depression [30,31]. Music therapy has emerged as a powerful tool in the treatment of MDD, and previous research has focused on exploring differences in how the brain responds to musical stimuli [32,33]. However, these approaches have yet to explain what the music changes to dampen the brain\u2019s hypoactive state. By combining EEG with musical stimulation therapy and decomposing EEG signals into different frequency bands, differences in brain function in response to musical stimulation were revealed [34\u201337]. When people are in different active states, there are differences in EEG signals of different frequencies [38,39]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the FC of MDD changes in different frequency bands, so the diagnosis of MDD by FC analysis with different frequency bands is worth investigating [40]. Specific frequency changes and specific network connectivity changes were seen in behavioral cognitive tasks, especially during music perception. According to He et al., music therapy relieves clinical MDD symptoms by improving functional brain connectivity and increasing connectivity with changes in FC [41,42]. These results support our hypothesis that functional connectivity across frequency bands is altered during musical stimulation therapy in MDD patients. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying functional connectivity problems and brain responses during musical stimulation therapy in MDD patients are unclear. In the EEG sensor space, the brain network consists of nodes and edges, where electrodes represent nodes and channel connections represent edges [43,44]. Various network properties are valid measures for quantifying functional integration and functional segregation in the brain. At present, the feature matrix of EEG functional connectivity mainly adopts correlation and coherent coupling methods. Phase-locking value (PLV) and coherence have stable effects on bulk conductivity [45]. Therefore, this paper adopts the PLV algorithm to calculate the correlation between EEG channels. By comparing the results of functional linkages, biomarkers that distinguish MDD and control groups were extracted. This study mainly analyzes the network changes of MDD in different frequency bands before and after musical stimulation. The connectivity matrix and topology graph are compared, and the network properties of graph theory are analyzed. The network features mainly include path length, node degree and clustering coefficient."

Network Characteristics\nThe constructed PLV-based functional brain network was used to characterize the connection structure between the MDD brain channel pairs under different musical stimuli. The building process of the brain functional network can be thought of as a process of abstractly representing connections between brain regions as nodes and connecting edges. The analysis of brain functional segregation is based on the local scale, and local measures focus on the functional differentiation capacity of the brain and measure the clustering properties within the brain network [48]. Because the brain functional network is complex and changeable, in order to further monitor the functional state of the brain, graph theory is used to extract multiple topological properties of the brain functional network: the brain functional network is constructed to extract the clustering coefficients and characteristic path lengths under different bands [49\u201351]. In this study, the corresponding local features are extracted for each PLV network constructed. The degree in the network represents the number of connections between a node and other nodes, and can be used as a measure to analyze the importance of a node in the network. The clustering coefficient of the brain function network indicates the possibility that the neighbors of a node become neighbors of each other [52\u201354]. The clustering coefficient (CC) of a node can reflect the closeness of the association relationship between the node groups in the network and is defined as:\nCC = 1n \u2211i\u2208N 2ti ki(ki\u22121) (5)\nwhere n is the total number of nodes, ki represents the number of adjacent nodes that the node has, and ti represents the number of relationships between the network through i-neighbor nodes. The characteristic path length is the average of the shortest path lengths between two nodes [55]. The length of the characteristic path can measure the information interaction strength between two nodes. The shorter the length, the stronger the information interaction between the two nodes, which can effectively characterize the connectivity of the two nodes. The characteristic path length (CPL) is used to measure the robustness of the network topology, and it is defined as:\nCPL = 1n \u2211i\u2208N \u2211j\u2208N,j 6=i dij n\u22121 (6)\nwhere n represents the number of nodes in the network, i and j represent different types of nodes in the network, and dij represents the distance between point i and point j."

Finally, four machine learning methods were used to classify patients with depression and healthy controls, and the effect of feature recognition was discussed from an individual perspective. According to Figures 2 and 3, we can analyze the changes in the brain networks before and after musical stimulation. In the delta band, the associated connections in depressed patients were reduced after musical stimulation, and were mainly concentrated in the frontal pole and frontal lobe regions. Studies have shown that delta signals brain abnormalities to a certain extent. The frontal lobe of the brain is responsible for higher levels of thought, including language, emotional expression, and working memory. This partly explains the lower connectivity of the frontal lobe region in the delta band in healthy patients than in depressed patients. The functional network in the delta band may be an important band to distinguish between types of depression. In the theta band, the change in the topology was not obvious. Changes in the alpha band can be analyzed using alpha asymmetry. Alpha is a frequency band that indicates brain health and is strongly associated with depression, and alpha asymmetry is also a biological feature of depression [61,62]. In the beta band, after musical stimulation, the functional topology connectivity of depressed patients was reduced, mainly in the frontal lobe and central region. The reason for this phenomenon may be that beta bands indicate the degree of emotional change and reflect the level of arousal in the brain. In addition, the cluster degree of the healthy control group also decreased in this frequency band, and the difference between the depressed patients and the healthy control group was significant. The frequency is related to the frequency of the musical stimulus [40]. According to the analysis of the statistical results, for the clustering coefficient, there was a significant difference in the delta frequency band before and after the musical stimulation, and there was also a significant difference between the patients and the control group. For the characteristic path length, there was a significant difference between the delta and beta bands. The results obtained were similar to previous studies [28]. Figures 4 and 5 show the changes to network properties. For average clustering coefficient, the clustering coefficient, which measures the degree of aggregation of nodes in the functional brain network, meant that depressed people were less connected in the delta band and improved after musical stimulation. In other bands, there was little difference between healthy controls and depressed patients. Based on the above analysis, the clustering coefficient in the delta band can be used as a feature to classify depression and health samples. According to Figure 4, since the path length shows the path from a node to another node, the shorter path length also represents the higher information transmission efficiency, indicating that in the beta band, depressed patients have a poor information transmission rate and a tendency of random network. In the theta and alpha\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1680 10 of 13\nbands, the difference between healthy samples and depressed patients was small, making it difficult to analyze their information transmission efficiency. According to the classification results, SVM had the best classification effect, reaching 93.75%, followed by KNN at 81.25%, and DT had the worst classification performance of only 68.75%. In addition, SVM also had the highest accuracy and recall rate among the classifiers, which shows that SVM has unique advantages in solving the problem of small samples and nonlinear dichotomy. Therefore, the clustering coefficient and characteristic path length can be considered as biomarkers to distinguish MDD from healthy controls. This study has some limitations. First of all, EEG signals are very susceptible to ex-ternal interference. Although we collected signals in a quiet environment and supplemented the preprocessing, there were still some interferences that we could not completely eliminate. Second, the number of subjects were relatively small, and the decision tree appears to be over-under-fit. Therefore, we need more samples to further verify the results. Finally, the choice of depression assessment scale was too singular, and we can consider choosing MADRS or HAM-A, which is actively implemented by doctors and can analyze individual items. Music therapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of depression, and future research can consider the effects of different styles of music on depression."

Secondly, in terms of EEG functional network characteristics, the average clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and degree of each node in the delta band decreased significantly after musical stimulation, while the characteristic path length in the beta band increased significantly. Finally, the average clustering coefficient and characteristic path length can be used as features to distinguish MDD from healthy controls.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.Q. and J.D.; data curation, X.X.; investigation, H.L.; methodology, C.M.; software, J.D. and T.W.; supervision, T.W.; validation, P.Q.; visualization, P.Q.; writing\u2014original draft, X.X.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.D.
