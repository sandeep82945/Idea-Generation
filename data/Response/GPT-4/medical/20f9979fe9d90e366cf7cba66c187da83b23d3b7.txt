Longitudinal Studies on Post-Hospital Outcomes: Investigate the long-term outcomes of ischaemic stroke (IS) patients with COVID-19, focusing on the recovery trajectory, recurrence of stroke, and long-term mortality rates. This research would extend beyond in-hospital lethality to understand the lasting impact of COVID-19 on stroke survivors, including quality of life, functional independence, and the need for long-term care or rehabilitation services.

Mechanisms Linking COVID-19 with Increased Stroke Severity and Lethality: Conduct studies to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms by which COVID-19 increases the severity and lethality of ischaemic strokes. This research could include investigating the role of hypercoagulability, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2, and how these factors interact with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic ischaemic heart disease (cIHD) to exacerbate stroke outcomes.

Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination on Stroke Outcomes: Examine the effects of COVID-19 vaccination status on the outcomes of ischaemic stroke patients, including the risk of in-hospital complications and lethality. This study could help understand whether vaccination offers any protective effects against severe outcomes in stroke patients who contract COVID-19, potentially influencing vaccination recommendations for high-risk populations.

Gender Differences in Stroke Outcomes in the Context of COVID-19: Explore the gender-specific differences in outcomes of IS patients with COVID-19, as the paper indicates variations in lethality and complications between men and women. Further research could delve into the biological, social, and healthcare-related factors contributing to these differences, aiming to develop gender-tailored prevention and treatment strategies.

Role of Pre-existing Comorbidities and Their Management in Stroke Outcomes during the Pandemic: Investigate how the management of pre-existing comorbidities such as arterial hypertension (AH), DM, and cIHD influences the outcomes of IS patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research could identify effective management strategies for these conditions that could reduce the risk of severe complications and death in stroke patients with COVID-19, potentially leading to updated clinical guidelines for the care of high-risk patients during pandemics.
