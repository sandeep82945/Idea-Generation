    "abstractText": "Cytoskeletal gels are prototyped to reproduce the mechanical contraction of the cytoskeleton invitro. They are composed of a polymer network (backbone), swollen by the presence of a liquid solvent, and active molecules (molecular motors, MMs) that transduce chemical energy into the mechanical work of contraction. These motors attach to the polymer chains to shorten them and/or act as dynamic crosslinks, thereby constraining the thermal fluctuations of the chains. We describe both mechanisms thermodynamically as a microstructural reconfiguration, where the backbone stiffens to motivate solvent (out)flow and accommodate contraction. Via simple steady-state energetic analysis, under the simplest case of isotropic deformation, we quantify the mechanical energy required to achieve contraction as a function of polymer chain density and molecular motor density. We identify two limit regimes, namely, fast MM activation (FM), and slow MM activation (SM). FM assumes that MMs provide all the available mechanical energy \u2018instantaneously\u2019 and leave the polymer in a stiffened state, i.e. the MM activity occurs at a time scale that is much smaller than that of solvent diffusion. SM assumes that the timescale for MM activation is much longer than that of solvent diffusion. To achieve the same final contracted state, FM requires the largest amount of work per unit reference volume, while SM requires the least. For all intermediate cases where the timescale of MM activation is comparable with that of solvent diffusion, the required work ranges between the two cases. We provide all these quantities as a function of chain density and MM density. Finally, we compare our results on contraction energetics with experiments and observe good agreement.",

            "text": "The cytoskeleton is the structural backbone of the cell and is primarily made up of actin, intermediate filaments and microtubules [1]. Actin filaments coupled with myosin motors actively partake in the mechanical response of the cell and are responsible for its contractile behaviour. Actomyosin II complexes pull on the actin chains to shorten them, therefore the 3D meshwork of crosslinked actin chains contracts. This process is mainly powered by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis, where released chemical energy from the breakdown of ATP into ADP and a phosphate, is expended in the form of mechanical work. This is a critical function required for motility, environmental adaptation, chemical transport, and intracellular signaling [1].\nUnderstanding cytoskeletal contraction from mechanical and energetic standpoints is critical to characterize tissue properties and tissue mechanics.\nCytoskeletal gels are engineered to mechanically model the cytoskeleton. They constitute a minimalistic physical system by including only the main components of the cytoskeleton: polymer chains and cytoplasm; while excluding organelles, membranes and other cell components [2,3]. Figure 1 outlines the main components of the gel and their arrangement in the system. These gels have been used to both characterize the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton and to study cell contractility.\nMultiple approaches to model the cytoskeleton and its active behaviours have been explored. An early bio-chemo-mechanical model for cytoskeletal contractility was introduced by Deshpande et al. [4]. Refined versions of this model were then developed to include thermodynamic motivations to cytoskeletal contractility [5] as well as experimental validation to explain the role of boundary conditions in defining the cell alignment mediated by the cytoskeleton [6]. Other early studies approached cytoskeletal modelling from a solid-mechanics foundation, with a focus on the effects of elasticity on cell shape and adhesion properties [7]. Gel models have also been widely adopted in modelling cytoskeletal mechanics; several models approached the problem from a hydrodynamic standpoint, where transient force dipoles, generated by myosin pulling on actin chains, create active contractile stresses [8,9]. The main limitation of such models lies in their assumption that actin filaments must not be slack, and this is not the case for some actin networks [9]. Furthermore, these models describe active stresses using parameters that are empirically determined, and typically lack physical meaning. Gels composed of slack chains are not well represented by these models as the cytoskeletal active stresses do not account for the level of tension in the chains. To overcome this limitation, recent studies propose an alternative approach based on poroelasticity, where the cytoskeleton is described as a polymer network swollen by the presence of the solvent (cytosol) [10-11]. In this biphasic material, the passive behavior is controlled by swelling and solvent flow [9,12-16], while the active behavior is described as an evolution of the mechanical stiffness of the polymer backbone [12] and is promoted by molecular motor activity. The total free energy of the gel is given by the sum of the strain energy of the network and the free energy (enthalpy and entropy) of chain-solvent mixing. The activation of contractile molecular motors (MM) increases the strain energy, representing a stiffening of the chain network [2,12,17-19]. This in turn increases the osmotic pressure of the solvent, locally, and, with it, the chemical potential of the solvent. Because the flow of the solvent is directed toward a reduction in chemical potential, via Fick\u2019s law, the solvent ultimately outflows from the stiffened gel, thereby accommodating gel contraction [12,20-21]. Polymer network stiffening can be achieved via dynamic crosslinking (DC) created by a MM attaching to more than one chain. This is described in some models as an evolution of the crosslink density [12,20].\nThe observed MM activity in actin cytoskeletal gels primarily involves chain shortening (CS) rather than DC [2]. Figure 1 presents the two motor activation mechanisms. An energetically based model incorporating realistic MM activation applicable to in-vivo environments is therefore necessary to fully understand actin gel contractile mechanics. This study builds on active polymer gel theory and introduces a new molecular motor model considering chain shortening (CS-MM), striving towards a more accurate representation of the physical system. Our model introduces a new thermodynamically inspired variation of neo-Hookean chain strain energy to incorporate a CS parameter we define as the \u2018microstretch\u2019. This parameter decouples chain density from\ncontractile mechanics, allowing for direct comparison between the energetic requirement for a specific contraction (quantity of molecular motors) and initial chain density.\nExperiments using an in-vitro actin network platform reveal a threshold for the minimum and maximum densities of MMs required to achieve a desired contraction, based on the crosslink density of the gel [22-23]. Via quasi-static energetic analysis, we use our model to predict this threshold in a direct comparison with experimental data of contractile acto-myosin networks. In this comparison, we introduce two contraction regimes: slow MM activation (SM), where the time scale for MM activation is longer than that for solvent outflow, and fast MM activation (FM), where contraction is triggered by an instantaneous injection of all MM work available (i.e. the timescale for motor activation is shorter than solvent outflow). The work performed by MMs is higher in the FM regime than in the SM one. Thus, we take the energetic requirement from the SM regime to predict the minimum MM density required for a desired contraction. To predict the maximum MM density, for a given crosslink density, we compute the maximum strain energy accumulated in each polymer chain prior to chain rupture [24-25]. Finally, our predictions for minimum and maximum MM density are in good agreement with the experiments.\nModel: Active Gel\nThe biphasic active gel is composed of a (swollen) polymer network, a solvent, and molecular motors (MM) (Fig. 1). The polymer chains provide the structural backbone of the gel, and are stretched to accommodate the presence of the solvent. We define the dry polymer network (prior to solvent absorption and swelling) as the stress-free reference state of the gel (albeit for some gels this is an idealized state since the polymer dissociates in the absence of solvent).\nThe total free energy density, per unit reference volume \ud835\udc49\", as described by [12], is\n\ud835\udf13 = \ud835\udf13#(\ud835\udc47, \ud835\udc6d, \ud835\udf3b) + \ud835\udf13$(\ud835\udc47, \ud835\udc36) + \u03a0(1 + \u03a9 \ud835\udc36 \u2212 \ud835\udc3d) (1) where \ud835\udf13# is the elastic strain energy density of the polymer network, \ud835\udf13$ is the free energy density of polymer-solvent mixing, \u03a0 is the hydrostatic pressure applied to the gel, \ud835\udc36 is the molecular concentration of solvent, per unit reference volume, \u03a9 is the molecular volume of the solvent and \ud835\udc3d is the swelling ratio of the gel (current volume to reference volume). In Eq. (1), \ud835\udc47 is the absolute temperature, \ud835\udc6d is the deformation tensor defined as\n\ud835\udc39%& = '(!

Considering the solvent bath is isothermal, from the first and second laws of thermodynamics [8] (see Appendix A), we obtain the relationship between stresses, chemical potential and the Helmholtz free energy from Eq.

Here, the two independent microstructural variables (\ud835\udf3b) being considered are \ud835\udc5b and \ud835\udf06=. Dynamic crosslinking molecular motors (DC-MM) are associated with an evolution of chain density \ud835\udc5b, as further polymerization with additional crosslinker molecules increases the number of active chains in the gel.

Here, the polymer fraction does not evolve as we assume the newly \u2018unengaged\u2019 monomers remain within the gel. Thus, mass conservation enforced by Eq. (3) applies at all times. We analyze here DC-MM and CS-MM contraction mechanisms separately. Additionally, note that \ud835\udc41 is defined in the reference (dry polymer) state, while the chain density in the current state is \ud835\udc41Z = \ud835\udc41/\ud835\udc3d.\nIsotropic contraction of unloaded gels Consider now an unloaded gel.

So if ?\u0305? = ?\u0305?#(/, before any MM activity, we will have ?\u0305? > ?\u0305?#(/ after MMs are activated. According to Eq. (8c), with substitution from Eq.

When ?\u0305? \u2260 0 the rate of free energy release is finite (under contraction or swelling) leading to finite contraction or swelling times. When ?\u0305? = 0 the energy release rate is equal to zero leading to infinite contraction or swelling times. This provides the condition of chemo-mechanical equilibrium, and is in agreement with the condition ?\u0305? = ?\u0305?#(/, where ?\u0305?#(/ = 0. In the solvent bath, \ud835\udf07#(/ = \u03a9(\ud835\udc43 \u2212 \ud835\udc43IJK) [10], with \ud835\udc43 the solvent pressure and \ud835\udc43IJK the vapor (cavitation) pressure. Taking \u03a0#(/ = \ud835\udc43 \u2212 \ud835\udc43IJK as the relative pressure of the solvent bath, we finally have ?\u0305?#(/ = 0.\nFrom Eq. (3) and (15), we can define the dimensionless chemical potential ?\u0305? as\n?\u0305? = 2 8 \"*F \", (20a)\nwith \"*F\n\", = '* F$ ', + \u03a9 '* F% 'B\n(20b)\nwhere \ud835\udf13f = \ud835\udf13 \u03a9/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47, \ud835\udf13f$ = \ud835\udf13$ \u03a9/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47, and \ud835\udf13f# = \ud835\udf13# \u03a9/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47 are dimensionless forms of free energy. From this, we can deduce that the positivity of the left-hand side of Eq. (17), under chemomechanical equilibrium (?\u0305? = 0), occurs at a free energy minimum, and therefore such a chemomechanical equilibrium is stable. In the following derivation, we will compare the free energy at three states: (0) the swollen equilibrium state, prior to MM activation; (i) the initial state when MM are activated and provide all the available mechanical work to stiffen the backbone; (f) the final state at which all the contraction has occurred and the stiffened gel has reached a new equilibrium configuration. The swelling ratio in (0) and (i) is the same, assuming MM activity is much faster than solvent diffusion. In this case \ud835\udc3d = \ud835\udc3d!.\nFor the generic state \ud835\udf1a = 0, \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc53, the dimensionless free energy can be rewritten from Eq.

(15) at chemical equilibrium by imposing the condition ?\u0305? = 0 in Eq. (15a), with \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5b!, \ud835\udf06= = 1, and \ud835\udc3d = \ud835\udc3d!. To achieve contraction, the swelling ratio must reduce from the initial state (i) to the final (f), thus \ud835\udc3dN < \ud835\udc3d0. At the initial state (i), while \ud835\udc3d0 = \ud835\udc3d!, the microstructure has evolved via an increase in chain density, giving \ud835\udc5b0 = \ud835\udc410\u03a9 > \ud835\udc5b! (DC-MM), and/or shortening of chains, giving \ud835\udf06=,0 < 1 (CS-MM).\nBoth these mechanisms induce network stiffening, thereby increasing the osmotic pressure, which in its dimensionless form \u03a0lDE$ = \u03a0DE$\u03a9/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47, from Eq.

From the equilibrium state (0) to the initial one (i), the mixing energy in unchanged giving \ud835\udf13f$,0 = \ud835\udf13f$,!, while the elastic strain energy has increased to give \ud835\udf13f#,0 > \ud835\udf13f#,!, and thus \ud835\udf13f0 > \ud835\udf13f!.\nTo define the final state (f) we must impose again chemical equilibrium. This involves the condition ?\u0305? = 0 in Eq. (15a) with \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5b0, \ud835\udf06= = \ud835\udf06=,0, and \ud835\udc3d = \ud835\udc3dN. The free energy in this state is given again by Eq. (21) with \ud835\udc3dN, \ud835\udc5bN = \ud835\udc5b0, and \ud835\udf06=,N = \ud835\udf06=,0.\nThe total change in volume, from the swollen equilibrium state (0) to the final contracted state (f), is given by the ratio \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc49N/\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc49! = \ud835\udc3dN/\ud835\udc3d!, with \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc49! and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc49N the unit volumes in the current (0) and (f) states. The ratio \ud835\udc3dN/\ud835\udc3d! identifies the degree of contraction, with smaller \ud835\udc3dN/\ud835\udc3d! requiring higher contraction. Higher contraction is achieved by increasing \ud835\udc5b0/\ud835\udc5b! and/or 1/\ud835\udf06=,0, and, as shown in the Results and Discussion section, the contraction amount depends also on the initial conditions defined by \ud835\udc3d! and \ud835\udc5b!.\nWe now introduce the microstructural mechanical work, \ud835\udc64=, per unit reference volume, (in dimensionless form, \ud835\udc64l= = \ud835\udc64= \u03a9/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47) required to create contraction and performed by the MM. We introduce two extreme cases of MM activated contraction: fast MM activation (FM), where a sudden injection of all the microstructural work available triggers contraction and slow MM activation (SM), where the time scale for MM activation is much longer than that for solvent flow. The work due to fast MM activation (FM) is\n\ud835\udc64l+= = \ud835\udf13f0 \u2212 \ud835\udf13f! (23) In this case, we assume that the time scale for MM activation is much shorter than that due to solvent flow. Additionally, we assume that, after the MMs perform all the microstructural work to stiffen the polymer, they stay in place keeping the polymer in its new stiffened state. This means that \ud835\udf06= and \ud835\udc5b are stationary from (i) to (f), i.e. \ud835\udf06=,N = \ud835\udf06=,0 and \ud835\udc5b0 = \ud835\udc5bN. Conversely, in the case of slow MM activation (SM), the work performed by the MM to achieve the final state is\n\ud835\udc64lP= = \ud835\udf13fN \u2212 \ud835\udf13f! (24)\nBecause any contraction is spontaneous, we will always have a lower free energy in the final state than in the initial, thus \ud835\udf13f0 \u2265 \ud835\udf13fN and \ud835\udc64l+= \u2265 \ud835\udc64lP=. In intermediate cases, for which the time scale for MM activation is comparable with that of solvent flow, we have \ud835\udc64lP= \u2264 \ud835\udc64l= \u2264 \ud835\udc64l+=. This means that slow activation requires the minimum work \ud835\udc64lP= to reach the state f, while fast activation requires the maximum work \ud835\udc64l+= for the same purpose."

            "text": "Chemo-mechanical Equilibrium\nAs discussed in the previous section, chemo-mechanical equilibrium is obtained from the condition of a homogeneous distribution of chemical potential, equal to that of the solvent bath, thus, ?\u0305? = 0. From Eq. (15), this imposes the following condition on the crosslink density\n\ud835\udc5b = 29:/B9B QR(212/B) 21B(/.G+ 3( (25a)\nGiven a microstretch \ud835\udf06= and Flory parameter \ud835\udf12, the swelling ratio \ud835\udc3d and (dimensionless) chain density \ud835\udc5b at equilibrium are coupled according to Eq. (25). From this equation, Figure 2-left reports the values of compatible \ud835\udc3d and \ud835\udc5b for different values of \ud835\udf12 and \ud835\udf06=. In this figure, one can observe that a larger (dimensionless) crosslink density \ud835\udc5b produces a smaller equilibrium swelling ratio \ud835\udc3d, as a stiffer gel can accommodate less volumetric swelling. The log-log plot in this figure shows the trend\n\ud835\udc5b ~ \ud835\udf06=< 21<: < \ud835\udc3d1S/> (25b)\nfor large \ud835\udc3d and \ud835\udf12 < 0.5, while for \ud835\udf12 = 0.5 we have \ud835\udc5b ~ \ud835\udf06=< \ud835\udc3d1T/>/3. Taking the microstretch as \ud835\udf06= = 1, from Figure 2 we can obtain the equilibrium swelling ratio of the passive gel \ud835\udc3d! from the initial crosslink density \ud835\udc5b!. This defines the initial state, prior to molecular motor (MM) activation, and is marked by blue circles on Figure 2. In the experimental setup used for model comparison [23], the measured values are \ud835\udc3d! = 1000, \ud835\udc5b! = 1.61 \u2219 101S, \ud835\udf06=,! = 1, thus, yielding \ud835\udf12 = \u22121.1 (see Appendix C). In the case of dynamic crosslinking molecular motors (DC-MM), from the same figure, given the microstretch remains \ud835\udf06= = 1, we can also determine the final swelling ratio \ud835\udc3dN associated with a final crosslink density \ud835\udc5bN.

I.e. the chemo-mechanical equilibrium at ?\u0305? = 0 is always stable. By rearranging Eq. (25), one can also obtain\n\ud835\udf06=< = ; B(/.\n;121:/B1B QR(212/B) (27a)\nFigure 2-right reports the values of compatible swelling ratio \ud835\udc3d versus microstretch \ud835\udf06=< for different values of \ud835\udf12 and \ud835\udc5b, based on Eq. (27). Because a smaller microstretch \ud835\udf06=< yields a stiffer gel, and thus smaller equilibrium swelling ratio \ud835\udc3d, \ud835\udf06=< and \ud835\udc3d are proportional. The log-log plot in this figure shows the trend\n\ud835\udf06=< ~ <; 21<: \ud835\udc3dS/> (27b)\nfor large \ud835\udc3d and \ud835\udf12 < 0.5 (which can also be extrapolated from Eq. (25b)), while for \ud835\udf12 = 0.5 we have \ud835\udf06=< ~ 3\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc3dT/>. In the case of chain-shortening molecular motors (CS-MM), this figure can be used to identify \ud835\udc3dN from a given \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5b! and \ud835\udf06=N < \ud835\udf06=0. For all the datapoints in Figure 2-right, the positivity of 2 8 '4F ', = <9B >B((B12) + < > ; B( \u2212 S > : B. + 2 >B ln M1 \u2212 2 B N (28)\nfrom Eq. (17), is again always satisfied. Thus, the chemo-mechanical equilibrium is again always stable.\nFrom Eq. (25b) and (27b), under the assumption of large swelling ratio \ud835\udc3d and \ud835\udf12 < 0.5, we can write\n\ud835\udc3d ~ M2/<1: ; G+ 3( N >/S\n(29)\nwhile for \ud835\udf12 = 0.5 we have \ud835\udc3d ~ (3\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf06=1<)1>/T. In Eq. (29) we can deduce that largely swollen gels are made of softer polymers, having smaller \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udf06=1<, and/or polymers composed of chains that have high affinity with solvent molecules, thus smaller (more negative) \ud835\udf12.\nLet us now define the free energy from Eq. (21). Figure 3 (left) plots \ud835\udf13f#/\ud835\udc5b versus \ud835\udc3d and \ud835\udf06=, and (right) \ud835\udf13f$ versus \ud835\udc3d and \ud835\udf12.

(30a) and (31a), with the normalized elastic free energy \ud835\udf13f#/\ud835\udc5b on the left and the mixing free energy \ud835\udf13f$ on the right.\nIn Figure 3-left, \ud835\udf13f#/\ud835\udc5b increases with an increased swelling ratio \ud835\udc3d as the chains become more stretched, thus decreasing the entropy of the network. Decreasing the chain microstretch \ud835\udf06= leads to a greater \ud835\udf13f#/\ud835\udc5b, and here the difference between two red curves represents the injected energy in the fast motor (FM) activation case for CS-MM, where MMs instantaneously evolve the microstructure, thereby prompting contraction.

In Figure 3-right, the mixing energy \ud835\udf13f$ decreases with increased \ud835\udc3d as more solvent is added to the mixture, thus increasing entropy. The semi-log plot in the red curves shows the asymptotic saturation energy\n\ud835\udf13f$ ~ \ud835\udf12 \u2212 1 (31b)\nfor large \ud835\udc3d.

In this figure we can observe that the work required for contraction is proportional to the initial crosslink density \ud835\udc5b! and to the degree of contraction (high contraction giving low \ud835\udc3dN/\ud835\udc3d0). For \ud835\udc3dN/\ud835\udc3d0 \u2192 0, we have that \ud835\udc64lP= , \ud835\udc64l+= \u2192 \u221e (maximum contraction), while for \ud835\udc3dN/\ud835\udc3d0 = 1 we have \ud835\udc64lP= = \ud835\udc64l+= = 0 (no contraction). These semi-log plots show a sharp increment in mechanical work for mild contractions (\ud835\udc3dN/\ud835\udc3d0 ~ 1) as well as for maximal contractions (\ud835\udc3dN/\ud835\udc3d0 \u2192 0), while intermediate contractions require more moderate increments in mechanical work. From the plots in this figure, we can observe that DC-MM and CS-MM require nearly identical \ud835\udc64lP= and \ud835\udc64l+= for a given \ud835\udc3dN/\ud835\udc3d! and for higher initial swelling ratios, namely \ud835\udc3d! = 100, and 1000. We can, however, observe slightly higher \ud835\udc64lP= for CS-MM at \ud835\udc3d! = 100 and very high contraction, i.e. \ud835\udc3dN/\ud835\udc3d! = 0.1. For smaller initial swelling ratio, i.e. \ud835\udc3d! = 10, we have a significant distinction between DC-MM and CS-MM. Here, we can see that CS-MM have larger \ud835\udc64lP= and smaller \ud835\udc64l+= compared to DC-MM.

            "text": "The energetic requirement for contraction, predicted from our model, can be compared with experimental results from literature. Bendix et al. [23] conducted cytoskeletal gel contraction experiments observing the effects of chain density and motor concentration on contraction. They found that certain configurations yield observable contraction, while others yielded no observable contraction. Our model can explain this transition based on the required mechanical energy for contraction. The experiments consisted in varying crosslinker (a-actinin) and molecular motor (myosin II) concentrations, \ud835\udc41a and \ud835\udc41VV respectively, with constant concentration of actin monomers, \ud835\udc41W. The gel specimens tested are of millimeter size, and the observable contractions were defined as achieving 90% volumetric deswelling (\ud835\udc3dN/\ud835\udc3d0 = 0.1) in a timespan below 60 minutes. Given this long timescale of observation, related to specimen size, we consider contractile networks as those with sufficient concentration of MM so that they can exert the minimum work required for very slow contraction, i.e. \ud835\udc64P=. Bendix et al. [23] reports the fixed concentration of actin monomers, as well as the ratios of myosin molecular motors \ud835\udc45=:Y = \ud835\udc41VV/\ud835\udc41Y and crosslinker a-actinin \ud835\udc45a:Y = \ud835\udc41a/\ud835\udc41W to actin. As explained in Appendix C, a portion of a-actinin molecules is required to form the actin filament bundles generating the polymer chain, thus unavailable to form chain-chain crosslinks, giving the ratio \ud835\udc45Z:Y = \ud835\udc41[/\ud835\udc41W. The crosslink (chain) density \ud835\udc41 relates to the crosslinker concentration \ud835\udc41a as \ud835\udc41 = \ud835\udc41a \u2212 \ud835\udc41Z [27-28], giving\n\ud835\udc41 = (\ud835\udc45a:Y \u2212 \ud835\udc45Z:Y)\ud835\udc41Y (34) Eq. (34) assumes that, after bundling, each new crosslinking molecule splits an existing chain into two, therefore adding a new chain to the network.\nWe assume that the work provided by the MMs scales with MM concentration as \ud835\udc64P= = \ud835\udc64=\ud835\udc41==, giving\n\ud835\udc64P= = \ud835\udc64=\ud835\udc45=:Y\ud835\udc41Y (35) where \ud835\udc64= is the work provided by one MM. Eq (35) is based on the hypothesis of unlimited ATP availability and that all motors equally contribute to provide a fixed mechanical work [29]. To determine the parameters of the gel at the equilibrium swollen state (0), for each experimental value of \ud835\udc45a:Y, we estimate \ud835\udc3d! from the chemo-mechanical equilibrium in Eq. (25) with \ud835\udf06= = 1 and \ud835\udc5b! = \ud835\udc41!\u03a9 from Eq. (34) (\ud835\udc41 = \ud835\udc41!). Here, \ud835\udc41Y is extracted from the current density of actin monomers \ud835\udc41ZY = \ud835\udc41Y/\ud835\udc3d!. Note that, \ud835\udf12 is undefined, and we extract it from a test case in [23] as explained in Appendix C, where \ud835\udc3d! = 1000 and \ud835\udc5b! = 1.61 \u2219 101S, giving \ud835\udf12 = \u22121.1. The latter is a material parameter, and thus is constant in each experiment. To determine the parameters of the gel at the final state (f), we enforce again chemo-mechanical equilibrium from Eq. (25). From this equation, with \ud835\udc3dN = 0.1 \ud835\udc3d! and \ud835\udf12, we can extract \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5bN, under \ud835\udf06= = 1 for DC-MM or \ud835\udf06= from \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc5b! for CS-MM. Finally, by substituting Eq. (30) into (24), we can calculate the work \ud835\udc64lP= = \ud835\udc64P=\u03a9/\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47. This result can then be substituted into Eq. (35) to extract the minimum required MM density \ud835\udc41=, based on the value of \ud835\udc64=, which is here taken as a fitting parameter.\nFigure 5 shows a comparison between our estimated minimum MM density required to contraction (with red shading indicating non-contractile regions) with the observed contractile (black circles) and non-contractile (red crosses) conditions in [23]. Our estimation is shown in the bottom solid line for CS-MM, and dashed line for DC-MM. For most of the experimental data points, except some outliers, our estimate agrees with experimental evidence. We speculate that some outlier data points, where contractile gels appear as non-contractile, or vice-versa, are due to geometrical imperfections. In this comparison we have adopted \ud835\udc64= = 1.9 \u2219 10\\ \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47 for both CS-MM and DCMM. These values are equivalent to approximately 1.3 ATP molecules consumed per myosin head per second in the timespan of one hour, as detailed in Appendix C. Experimental observations reported 0.5-5 ATP molecules consumed per myosin head per second [30]. Because \ud835\udc64= estimates the effective work produced by the MM, the real ATP energy consumed is expected to be higher. The MM efficiency in this case can be estimated from a minimum of 1.3/5 = 26% to a maximum of 1.3/0.5 = 86%. The upper bound in MM concentration in Figure 5 is due to a maximum strain energy per chain in the final state, \ud835\udf13#,N/\ud835\udc41!, above which the a-actinin crosslink breaks. In these conditions, contraction is prevented. We adopt this energy maximum as \ud835\udf13#,$J(/\ud835\udc41! = 2.44 \u2219 10> \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47 to fit the upper bound of the contractile region for both CS-MM and DC-MM. This value corresponds to the energy required to break one crosslink bond between the chains, and is equivalent to the energy of approximately 600 hydrogen bonds (see Appendix C). In regions of high crosslinking, such as on the right side of Figure 5, contraction can become much slower, as discussed by [22]. In the experimental timeframe observed by [23], contractions requiring more than 60 minutes were ignored, therefore classifying such trials as non-contractile. We speculate that the networks associated with the red crosses on the right side of Figure 5 may still be contractile, as predicted by our model, but requiring more than 60 minutes.\nThe contractile region predicted by our model (white shading) agrees with experiments for the lower and upper bounds in Figure 5, highlighting the energetic limit of contraction for cytoskeletal network and the structural limit of the actin backbone, respectively. Both CS-MM and DC-MM give similar predictions, with CS-MM being slightly more accurate.\ndashed for DC-MM), while the experimental data points, from [23] (Contractile exp.), are reported with red crosses, to indicate non-contractile gels, and black circles, to indicate contractile gels. The minimum energetic requirement from the model prediction is taken from \ud835\udc64P= (Figure 4) to provide the lower limit, (bottom black lines). The limit in elastic strain energy stored in each chain prior to chain rupture, \ud835\udf13#,$J(/\ud835\udc41, provides the upper limit (top black lines). Red shading indicates noncontractile regions, violating either the lower or the upper limits.\nIt should be noted that our model considers the polymer backbone to be composed of Gaussian (slack) chains. This hypothesis limits the reliability of our model, particularly in highly crosslinked networks (right side of Figure 5). Moreover, in this investigation we assumed, for simplicity, that CS-MM and DC-MM act as separate mechanisms. In general, both mechanisms can occur at the same time in a gel, and one should study their coupled effects during contraction. Our simplified approach provides useful results if one assumes that one mechanism prevails over the other. In actin gels equipped with myosin motors, such as the one used in [23], chain shortening is commonly the predominant mechanism. This is because actin polymerization and actin-myosin binding, which provide dynamic crosslinking, occur initially and leave the gel in a stiffened state, while myosin progressively shortens actin chains. This conclusion might explain why our prediction from CS-MM (solid lines), in Figure 5, yields slightly better agreement with experiments."

            "text": "Contractile cytoskeletal networks exhibit a range of energetically motivated contractions caused by molecular motor activity. Our model introduces a more physical representation of CS-MM activation, where, from a mechanical standpoint, the effective chain length (composed of only engaged monomers) shortens according to the newly introduced \u2018microstretch\u2019 parameter. This approach yields similar results to that of previously employed chain density evolution models, particularly for highly swollen gels. Via simple steady state energetic analysis, under the simplest case of isotropic contraction, we quantify the mechanical energy required for contraction as a function of polymer chain density and molecular motor density. We identify two limit cases, (FM) fast molecular motor (MM) activation for which MMs provide all the available mechanical energy immediately and (SM) slow MM activation where the timescale is much longer, and contraction is much slower. These two cases represent the maximum and minimum timescales for the contraction process. They also represent the two limits in the efficiency of energy transduction, where sm gives the highest efficiency and FM gives the lowest efficiency. This is because, to achieve the same amount of contraction, the mechanical work required is highest with fast MM activation (\ud835\udc64+=) and lowest with slow MM activation (\ud835\udc64E$), i.e. \ud835\udc64P= < \ud835\udc64 < \ud835\udc64+=. We observe that the energetic cost of contraction fulfilled by MM is proportional to chain density and MM density. Finally, we compare our results with experiments and observe good agreement, where the 90% contraction boundary is predicted by our model.\nOur model provides an accurate and simple description of the energetic landscape of contraction for gels composed of slack chains. It also provides the minimum requirement of actin and myosin density to allow cytoskeletal contraction in such systems. Further development of this model will allow for a more comprehensive description of the cytoskeleton, for example one composed of tight chains."

Considering chemical equilibrium, homogeneous and stationary distribution of temperature, and species conservation, which also implies no flux of species, and no microstructural change, the first 3 terms on the right-hand side of Eq.

These considerations provide equations (4) and (5) and b* b6 = \u2212\ud835\udf02 (A11)\nIn Eq. (5), the specie considered is water, and the index \ud835\udc5e is omitted.

The last two terms govern the transient microstructural processes, where the energy production from chemical reactions can produce a microstructural change [8]. Considering that \ud835\udc44a = 0 for all species except ATP and ADP (adenosine triphosphate and diphosphate, respectively), we have that\n(\ud835\udf07WAc \u2212 \ud835\udf07Wec)\ud835\udc44` \u2265 b* b.# \ud835\udf01-\u0307 (A13)\nwith \ud835\udc44` the rate of consumption (production) of ATP (ADP) during hydrolysis. The inequality holds so long that the efficiency of the mechanotransduction process is less than unity. We can thus rewrite Eq. (A13) as b* b.# \ud835\udf01-\u0307 = ?\u0307?- (A14a)\nwhere ?\u0307?- is the mechanical power density, per unit reference volume, required to evolve the microstructural variable \ud835\udf01- at the rate \ud835\udf01-\u0307. If these mechanisms are driven by molecular motors (MMs) hydrolyzing ATP (adenosine triphosphate), we can write ?\u0307?- = \ud835\udc53-?\u0307?, with \ud835\udc53- the portion of energy required to evolve \ud835\udf01-, and ?\u0307? = \u2211 ?\u0307?-- the total power generated by ATP hydrolysis. The latter is given by\n?\u0307? = \ud835\udf11(\ud835\udf07WAc \u2212 \ud835\udf07Wec)\ud835\udc44` (A14b) where \ud835\udf11 is the energy transduction efficiency of the MMs. Eq.

Gaussian chains are assumed to be non-interacting, and the free energy \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc790) of the generic i-th Gaussian chain is described by Boltzmann\u2019s entropy equation \ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc790) = \u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47 ln[\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc790)] (B3)\nwhere \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc790) is the probability for chain i of having the end-to-end vector equal to \ud835\udc790.

In this case \ud835\udc5a represent the number of engaged monomers between crosslinks in the deformed state and \ud835\udc5a! that in the undeformed\nstate. A common assumption is that the chain length is unchanged, and so the number of engaged monomers between crosslinks, giving \ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udc5a! and \ud835\udf06= = 1. This recovers traditional neoHookean elasticity. However, chain shortening molecular motors can reduce the effective number of monomers between crosslinks, leading to \ud835\udc5a < \ud835\udc5a!, from which \ud835\udf06= < 1.

            "text": "The parameters of the model are based on experiments performed on actin gels by Bendix et al. [19], with data extracted from the supplementary material. The gel volume in the equilibrium swollen state is \ud835\udc49 = 8.8 \u2219 1012! \ud835\udc5a> [23]. We consider an actin monomer as a spheroidal molecule of diameter \ud835\udc51Y = 5 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a [31]. Given the concentration of actin monomers in the current state (number of monomers per unit current volume) \ud835\udc41ZY = 1.43 \u2219 10<< \ud835\udc5a1>, we can calculate the volume of the polymer as \ud835\udc49K = \ud835\udc41ZY\ud835\udc49!\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc51Y>/6, giving \ud835\udc49K = 8.24 \u2219 1012> \ud835\udc5a>. Because the equilibrium swelling ratio is \ud835\udc3d! = \ud835\udc49/\ud835\udc49K, we have then \ud835\udc3d! = 1068.45, which we round to \ud835\udc3d! \u2243 1000. This gives the actin density in the reference state \ud835\udc41Y = \ud835\udc41ZY \ud835\udc3d! = 1.43 \u2219 10<S \ud835\udc5a1>. The cytoskeletal network is composed of chains, which are made of bundles of actin filaments. In each filament, on average, every 30 actin monomers, there is an a-actinin molecule [32]. This gives the ratio \ud835\udc45Z:Y = 0.03 in Eq. (31). For the example case of \ud835\udc45q:Y = 0.11 we have the crosslink density \ud835\udc41! = 1.14 \u2219 10<U \ud835\udc5a1>. Taking the diameter of a water molecule as \ud835\udc51r = 0.3 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5a, we have then \u03a9 = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc51r> /6, giving \u03a9 \u2243 1.41 \u2219 101<s \ud835\udc5a>. The nominal crosslink density becomes then \ud835\udc5b! = \ud835\udc41!\u03a9 = 1.61 \u2219 101S. Eq. (25), with \ud835\udf06$ = 1, is satisfied and gives our initial conditions if \ud835\udf12 = \u22121.1.\nTake \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47 = 4.14 \u2219 101<2 \ud835\udc3d as a unit energy [12]. The total mechanical work provided by a single MM during the whole contraction process, \ud835\udc64=, is used in our investigation as a fitting parameter to predict the lower bound estimation of the minimum required MM density for contraction in Figure 5. This, for both CS-MM and DC-MM, this computes to \ud835\udc64= = 8 \u2219 1012U \ud835\udc3d = 1.9 \u2219 10\\ \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47. Taking the energy of ATP hydrolysis as 12 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47 per ATP molecule [31], this computes to the equivalent energy provided by approximately 417 ATP molecules hydrolyzing on each motor every second for a period of one hour. Considering each myosin motor has roughly 300 heads [31], this computes to the equivalent of roughly 1.3 ATP molecules consumer per head every second for one hour. It should, however, be noted that the efficiency of mechanotransduction is less than unity, thus the real ATP consumption is expected to be higher than the above estimation. The maximum strain energy stored by one polymer chain prior to crosslink (chain) rupture is used as a fitting parameter for the upper bound estimation of the required MM density in Figure 5. This computes to \ud835\udf13#,$J(/\ud835\udc41! = 1.01 \u2219 1012t \ud835\udc3d = 2.44 \u2219 10> \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47 for both CS-MM and DC-MM. Given a breaking a hydrogen bond requires approximately 10 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc3d/\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59 = 4 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47 [33], this strain energy is equivalent to breaking approximately 600 hydrogen bonds."
