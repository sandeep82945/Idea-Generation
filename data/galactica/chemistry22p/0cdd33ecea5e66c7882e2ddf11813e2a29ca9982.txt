Curcumin and germacrone, natural products present in the Zingiberaceae family of plants, have several biological properties. Among these properties, the anti-NSCLC cancer action is noteworthy. In this paper, kinetics of the two compounds in rat liver microsomes (RLMs), human liver microsomes (HLMs), and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4, 1A2, 2E1, and 2C19) in an NADPH-generating system in vitro were evaluated by UP-HPLC–MS/MS (ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry). The contents of four cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, adjusting by the compounds were detected using Western blotting in vitro and in vivo. The t1/2 of curcumin was 22.35 min in RLMs and 173.28 min in HLMs, while 18.02 and 16.37 min were gained for germacrone. The Vmax of curcumin in RLMs was about 4-fold in HLMs, meanwhile, the Vmax of germacrone in RLMs was similar to that of HLMs. The single enzyme t1/2 of curcumin was 38.51 min in CYP3A4, 301.4 min in 1A2, 69.31 min in 2E1, 63.01 min in 2C19; besides, as to the same enzymes, t1/2 of germacrone was 36.48 min, 86.64 min, 69.31 min, and 57.76 min. The dynamic curves were obtained by reasonable experimental design and the metabolism of curcumin and germacrone were selected in RLMs/HLMs. The selectivities in the two liver microsomes differed in degradation performance. These results meant that we should pay more attention to drugs in clinical medication–drug and drug–enzyme interactions. 1. conclusions In summary, the degradations of curcumin in RLMs and HLMs were selective and significantly different, the degradation velocity of curcumin in HLMs was slower than that

of RLMs. However, germacrone had a weak selectivity. In vivo and in vitro, curcumin could inhibit the activity and decrease the content of CYP3A4, 1A2, 2E1, and 2C19; meanwhile, germacrone could inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, 1A2, 2E1, and 2C19, but increase the content of CYP3A4, 1A2, 2E1, and 2C19. The results significantly demonstrated that both of two compounds may be developed to CYP3A4 or 2C19 target new drugs, and combination with other cancer drugs in clinical practice.
