    "abstractText": "Purpose To assess the effect of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) on emotional and mindless eating and, consequently, body mass index (BMI) loss, in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. Materials and Methods A prospective exploratory cohort study was conducted with two groups of patients who had undergone bariatric surgery: the DBT group received DBT group skills training sessions, while the control group received no intervention. Outcome measurements included BMI and scores of the Emotional Eating Scale (EES) and Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ). Results The study included 36 women: 18 in each group. In the DBT group, the interval from surgery was 11.17 \u00b1 7.12 months, and in the control group 10.89 \u00b1 5.74. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was done in 88.9% and 83.3% of patients in the DBT and control groups respectively. The rest underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The DBT group showed significant changes in overall and subscale scores of the EES and MEQ and BMI in kg/m2 after 6 months of follow-up. BMI in kg/m2 changed from mean \u00b1 SD 35.45 \u00b1 6.17 to 28.47 \u00b1 4.28 in the DBT group, in control 35.88 \u00b1 5.07 to 31.56 \u00b1 3.71. The excess weight loss percentage (EWL%) in the DBT was mean \u00b1 SD 75.3 \u00b1 17.9 and in the control was 63.6 \u00b1 14.5. In the DBT group, the EES score and MEQ score changed from mean \u00b1 SD 45.06 \u00b1 20.19 to 20.50 \u00b1 13.40 and 11.52 \u00b1 2.02 to 15.87 \u00b1 1.92, respectively. The control group showed no significant change in scores. Conclusions DBT skills training can reduce emotional eating, increase mindful eating, and facilitate weight loss after bariatric surgery.",

Some factors have been implicated in these poor outcomes, Key points \u2022 Some patients find it difficult to deal with their eating behavior after bariatric surgery. \u2022 We assessed the effect of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in these patients. \u2022 DBT can be an effective weight loss intervention in these patients after bariatric surgery.\n* Mohamed Hany dr.mhany@gmail.com\n1 Department of\u00a0Surgery, Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, 165 Horreya Avenue, Hadara\u00a021561, Alexandria, Egypt\n2 Psychiatry and\u00a0Psychotherapy Clinic, Madina Women\u2019s Hospital, 290 St., Building Number 25 Smouha, Bariatric\u00a0CentreAlexandria, Egypt\n3 Ain Shams University, 1 Elsarayat St, AbbaseyaCairo\u00a011517, Egypt\n4 Elmaamora Psychiatric Hospital, Egyptian Ministry of\u00a0Health, Alexandria, Egypt\n5 Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC), Albinusdreef 2, 2333\u00a0ZA\u00a0Leiden, The\u00a0Netherlands\n1 3\nincluding physiological processes, psychological characteristics, behavioral factors, and eating disorders [2]. Several behavioral problems related to mindless and emotional eating have been observed after bariatric surgery, like eating too much, consuming high amounts of high-caloric soft foods, eating while distracted, and/ or rapid eating [3]. Furthermore, emotional eating is defined as eating in response to an emotional state rather than physiological hunger [4], which in the end can lead to increased body mass index (BMI) and/or poor weight loss [5, 6]. Emotional eating is prevalent in about 40% of bariatric surgery candidates [7].\nHowever, a study by Gero et\u00a0al. [8] showed an improvement of eating behavior after bariatric surgery, mainly RYGB without intervention. They used Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) preoperatively (baseline) and 1\u00a0year post-operatively. Evaluation of cases showed a \u201chealthy\u201d EDE-Q in 27.4% at baseline and in 83.7% at 1\u00a0year.\nDialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a treatment based on the affect regulation model [9\u201311] and it adapted for treating binge eating disorders [12, 13]\nDBT is an effective treatment for a variety of emotional and behavioral problems including emotion dysregulation [14]. Nevertheless, the literature is lacking data about the usefulness of DBT skills training for weight loss after bariatric surgery [15\u201317].\nThe purpose of this study was to test if DBT skills would reduce emotional eating and help participants acquire mindful eating skills while enhancing emotion regulation, helping them lose weight."

The items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (no desire to eat) to 4 (an overwhelming urge to eat). The scale comprises three subscales: anger/frustration, anxiety, and depression [18]. Higher scores indicate a greater urge to eat in response to emotions.\n4- Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ)\nThe MEQ is a 28-item self-report questionnaire rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (usually). It measures the five domains of mindful eating: disinhibition, external cues, awareness, emotional response, and distraction. Higher scores indicate more mindful eating [19].\nDBT Intervention\nThe participants in the DBT group received 16 weekly, 2.25-h therapy sessions. Participants were informed that if they were absent for two consecutive sessions or four non-consecutive sessions, they would be out of therapy.\nDBT sessions had mindfulness practice, the DBT rationales, and new skills training in emotion regulation and distress tolerance (for the complete DBT training session description and agenda, please see Appendix 1 Table\u00a03 and Appendix 2))."

The EES and MEQ were translated by two blinded independent translators who speak Arabic as a mother tongue and are fluent in English. They are also healthcare professionals familiar with the terminology used in the tools. Back translation to the original language was performed to avoid any problems across the two cultures and to ensure quality and accuracy since inconsistencies in translation would jeopardize the accuracy of the results. The translated EES showed good internal reliability, with an overall Cronbach\u2019s alpha of 0.914 and the subscale values as follows: anger and frustration: 0.815, anxiety: 0.759, and depression: 0.747.

            "text": "This was a prospective exploratory cohort study whereby 36 post-bariatric patients were included. Fifty percent got 16\u00a0weeks of DBT therapy and we evaluated the effect of DBT on emotional and mindless eating and consequently on weight loss after bariatric surgery. BMI in kg/m2 was significantly lower in the DBT group compared to the control group at 3-month (29.69 \u00b1 4.2 vs 32.61 \u00b1 3.81, p 0.038) and 6-month follow-up (28.47 \u00b1 4.28 vs 31.56 \u00b1 3.71, p 0.027). The EES and MEQ scores are significantly changed in favor of the DBT group.\nInadequate weight loss and weight regain are known drawbacks of bariatric surgery that may be related to psychological or behavioral issues [20]. Non-compliance with dietary recommendations is strongly linked to insufficient weight loss after bariatric surgery [21, 22].\nTable 2 EES changes in the DBT group and the control group\nDBT, dialectical behavior therapy; EES, Emotional Eating Scale\nDBT group Control group Sig Effect size\nMean \u00b1 SD Anger and frustration Baseline 17.61 \u00b1 9.12 18.83 \u00b1 8.34 < .001 .383\nAfter 4\u00a0months 7.72 \u00b1 6.41 17.78 \u00b1 4.61 .012 Interaction .001\nAnxiety Baseline 16.617.79 16.116.81 < .001 .317 After 4\u00a0months 7.284.80 16.283.58\n.013 Interaction < .001\nDepression Baseline 16.7 \u00b1 38.35 11.1 \u00b1 32.34 .044 .114 After 4\u00a0months 22.2 \u00b1 42.78 27.8 \u00b1 46.09\n> .999 Interaction .442\nOverall score Baseline 45.06 \u00b1 20.19 45.72 \u00b1 17.94 < .001 .391 After 4\u00a0months 20.50 \u00b1 13.40 45.33 \u00b1 6.15\n.006 Interaction < .001\nMedian (IQR) percentage change from baseline \u2212 54.08 (\u2212 70.68 to \u2212 43.49) 5.28 (\u2212 26.78 to 2.70) < .001\n1 3\nPost-bariatric patients who maintain unhealthy eating habits have a more than twofold higher risk of failure to achieve weight loss [23]. In that study, participants showed improvement in emotional eating as they acquired skills that helped them deal with their emotions. Also, participants showed improvements regarding mindful eating, as they learned to pay complete attention to their food. This effect was also seen in this study regarding the DBT group that showed significant changes in the overall and subscale scores of the EES and MEQ as well as BMI after the 16-week training was significantly reduced after the training. In total, the reduction in the DBT group was significantly greater compared to the control group.\nSince this type of psychological intervention is somehow new and already increasingly described in the literature of bariatric surgery [15\u201317], we hope to highlight that this could be a new way of looking at post-operative care for all bariatric patients in the future. It is always good to see in all the published papers what implementation brings of surgical techniques within the bariatric surgery and therefore to decrease the insufficient weight loss after bariatric surgery. However, the aspect of psychology should never be underestimated. Noting this, this study only looked at post-operative care. In the future, it might also help to test and perform the EES and MEQ as early as preoperatively. However, before we can judge this, larger comprehensive studies should be conducted first.\nIn the past, a systematic review was conducted by David et\u00a0al. [24] on the preoperative and post-operative psychosocial interventions for bariatric surgery patients and found strong evidence regarding eating behaviors. The systematic review found that psychosocial interventions such as mindfulness, acceptance, and DBT can improve eating pathology among bariatric patients, and the optimal time to initiate treatment appears to be early in the post-operative period before significant problematic eating behaviors and weight regains occur. David et\u00a0al. [24] found in three of their included studies that the treatments did not improve weight loss outcomes [25\u201327]. These findings are consistent with studies analyzing the effect of DBT on eating behaviors and obesity. In Glisenti and Strodl\u2019s study [28] concerning the treatment of individuals with obesity who rated high on emotional eating using four case studies that involved 22 sessions of DBT, at the 8-week followup, the two cases that had received DBT had lost 10.1% and 7.6% of their initial body weight. However, also here the number of included patients is still too little for a good judgment, but it shows the potential of this therapy as part of the bariatric procedure in all aspects. Further within the\nscientific community, there is no consensus known about the cutoff values of the EES and MEQ. Again, this study was only able to demonstrate a meaningful difference and not indicate at what value it would no longer be relevant. The studies conclude that there should be more correction for confounding factors and stratification of the groups to get a better insight on cutoff values.\nCurrently, this research group is conducting a followup study among larger numbers with more distribution of demographic characteristics to hopefully arrive at a valid cutoff value within the bariatric population and increase the power of this research."

            "text": "It included a relatively small number of candidates in a single clinic, and all the participants were female. A known fact is that \u00b1 80% of the patients for a bariatric procedure are females. Due to the prevalence of indications among post-bariatric patients visiting the clinic, this was women in our case. Also, many groups still run in parallel sessions in our follow-up research. This study is the primary result of accidentally single-gender focus. The fact is that our study started before the pandemic. Subsequently, new recruitment was not possible due to bariatric surgeries being briefly put on hold as recommended by the IFSO. Since more patients were further recruited when vaccination started, new inclusions and follow-up research have been restarted and will be presented in the future. Furthermore, studies like this would ask for randomization between groups. Know is that non-randomized trials cause a possible selection bias and therefore an overestimation of the effect. Nevertheless, this type of investigation and therapy are not blinded possible, and an assessment is always necessary to include the right patients. Therefore, a larger study with more equal distribution and the possibility to correct for more confounding factors could help.\nAlso, we included only one component of DBT, the group skill training sessions; the individual psychotherapy sessions were not included in this study. Finally, the lack of followup assessment could hinder a more powerful analysis of the results of the intervention over time, especially regarding the generalization of the skills learned."

Participants also learned about eating mindfully, adopting non-judgmental eating behavior, enjoying the taste of food regardless of amount, and deliberately chewing slowly.\nEmotion regulation skills encouraged an understanding of how emotions function, dealing with vulnerability to negative emotions, increasing positive emotions, changing certain negative emotions through opposite to emotion action, accepting emotions instead of ignoring them, and managing urges regarding specific types of food (urge surfing).\nThrough the distress tolerance skills imparted, participants became familiar with effective and adaptive means for enduring stressors and painful experiences without turning to emotional eating, developing new ways of soothing themselves other than through food, and acceptance of food, the self, and body image. In the final session, a relapse prevention plan was developed. All sixteen sessions followed a standardized outline (Appendix\u00a01 Table\u00a03).\nAll participants completed the post-test questionnaire and shared their feedback.\nFollowing each group session, participants were assigned homework (to practice the skills taught in the group).
