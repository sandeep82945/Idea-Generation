Yang 7, Zhi-Ming Yu 4,5 , Hongsheng Chen 1,2,3 , Baile Zhang 8,9 & Yihao Yang 1,2,3\nThe hypothetical Weyl particles in high-energy physics have been discovered in three-dimensional crystals as collective quasiparticle excitations near twofold degenerate Weyl points. Such momentum-space Weyl particles carry quantised chiral charges, which can be measured by counting the number of Fermi arcs emanating from the corresponding Weyl points. It is known that merging unit-charged Weyl particles can create new ones with more charges. However, only very recently has it been realised that there is an upper limit \u2014 the maximal charge number that a two-fold Weyl point can host is four \u2014 achievable only in crystals without spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report the experimental realisation of such a maximally charged Weyl point in a threedimensional photonic crystal. The four charges support quadruple-helicoid Fermi arcs, forming an unprecedented topology of twonon-contractible loops in the surface Brillouin zone. The helicoid Fermi arcs also exhibit the longpursued type-II van Hove singularities that can reside at arbitrary momenta. This discovery reveals a type of maximally charged Weyl particles beyond conventional topological particles in crystals.\nThere is a longstanding paradigm in condensed matter and other material fields that the low-energy excitations near certain band degeneracy points represent a platform for the emulation of exotic particles originally predicted in high-energy physics. A recent example is the Weyl points (WPs) (Fig. 1a, left panel) in three-dimensional (3D) band structures that represent the discovery of Weyl particles in a crystal environment, although their counterparts in high-energy physics remain hypothetical1\u20135. Such Weyl particles in crystals carry quantised chiral charges (Fig. 1b, left panel), as measured by the Chern number (C), and exhibit topologically protected helicoidal surface states (Fig. 1c, left panel), which form Fermi arcs at the Fermi level in the surface Brillouin zone (Fig. 1d, left panel)5. Generally,Weyl particles carry a unit chiral charge (|C| = 1). Moving beyond the framework of high-energy physics, the crystals\u2019 rich symmetry groups have helped to generalise Weyl particles into a big family of topological particles in crystals.While conventional Weyl particles have a spin of 1/2, in accord with the two-fold degeneracyof aWeyl point, unconventional topological particles can emerge nearmultifold banddegeneracies in 3Dcrystals, behaving like particles with high spin6\u201311. For example, the recently discovered spin-1 topological particles are formed near a three-fold band degeneracy, exhibiting a chiral charge of two (|C| = 2)7\u201311.

However, it is unclear whether the chiral charge of spin-1/2 Weyl particles is subject to such an upper limit.\nThe answer to this question is nontrivial because it is known that merging two or more unit-charged Weyl particles is able to generate new ones with more charges13. For example, a charge-2 Weyl particle formed in a crystal with C4 or C3 symmetry can be treated as two charge-1 Weyl particles merged together13\u201316. The resultant dispersion of the two-fold degeneracy changes from linear to quadratic in the plane perpendicular to the C4 or C3 axis (Fig. 1a, middle panel). The two charges support double helicoids of surface states (Fig. 1c, middle panel), being able to form a noncontractible loop in the surface Brillouin zone at Fermi level\n(Fig. 1d, middle panel). Charge-3 Weyl particles can be constructed similarly13,14.\nOnly very recently has it been realised that there indeed exists an upper limit on the charge of Weyl particles17\u201319. After exhaustively examining all possible symmetry groups, it has been pointed out that a two-fold WP can maximally host a chiral charge of four18,19, as previously missed in early theories of Weyl particles. The four charges exhibit complex spin texture analogous to a previously-overlooked higher-order skyrmion with a topological skyrmion number Nsk = 4 in real space (Fig. 1b, right panel)20. This previously missed Weyl particle disperses cubically along certain directions (Fig. 1a, right panel), hosting quadruple helicoids of surface states (Fig. 1c, right panel). In particular, the Fermi arcs at the Fermi level can formanunprecedented topology of two\u2014the maximum possible number\u2014noncontractible loops in the surface Brillouin zone (Fig. 1d, right panel).

For the charge-1 WP (yellow dot), the single Fermi arc forms an open curve; For the charge-2 WP (green dot), the double Fermi arcs can form a single noncontractible loop, characterisedbyW = {1,0} or {0,1}; For themaximally chargedWP (red dot), the quadruple Fermi arcs can form double noncontractible loops, characterised byW = {1,1}. These three cases are topologically distinct from each other. In this work, we mainly focus on the maximally charged WP (highlighted as a shaded area).\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7359 2\nin PdGa that rely on strong spin-orbit coupling12, the maximally charged spin-1/2 Weyl particles can emerge only in crystals without spin-orbit coupling17\u201319.\nHere, we experimentally demonstrate such a charge-4 Weyl particle in a 3D photonic crystal. Apart from the maximally charged WP, our photonic crystal hosts a series of other topological nodal points, includingmultiple charge-1 WPs, multiple charge-2 WPs, and a charge2 triple point\u2014a three-fold degeneracy with chiral charge 221,22. Via microwave pump-probe spectroscopies, we directly map out the projected bulk dispersion and the exotic quadruple-helicoid Fermi arcs of the topological surface states emanating from the maximally charged WP, verifying that the topological charge of this newlydiscovered band degeneracy is indeed four. Remarkably, the quadruple Fermi arcs form double noncontractible loops wrapping around the surface Brillouin zone torus, characterised by two winding numbersW= {wx,wy} = {1,1}, a previously-unidentified class of iso-frequency contours. Moreover, the helicoid arcs exhibit the long-pursued type-II van Hove singularities with saddle point dispersions that are not constrained to reside at time-reversal-invariant momenta23.\nDesign of a 3D photonic crystal with themaximally charged WP The designed 3D photonic crystal has a cubic unit cell with lattice constant a = 15mm, as shown in Fig. 2a. Each unit cell contains four equilateral metallic triangles with the vertices at the centre of twelve edges. Each vertex connects to eight adjacent vertices via square rods with length l = ffiffi 6 p 2 a and widthw = 1mm. As it is a good approximation for metals to be treated as perfect electric conductors (PECs) at microwave frequencies, we set the equilateral triangles as PECs and the rest of the volume as air in numerical calculations. The resulting 3D\nphotonic crystal has symmorphic space group P432 (No. 207) with C3 rotation symmetry along [111] direction, and C4 rotation symmetry along [100], [010], and [001] directions (see SupplementaryNote 3 and Supplementary Fig. 12 for the detailed design). The space group symmetry of this photonic crystal can be generated by the following five symmetry operators: a three-fold rotation along [111] direction C3,111, three two-fold rotations along [001] directionC2z, [100] direction C2x, and [110] direction C2,110, and time-reversal symmetry \u03c4. Since the space group P432 does not have inversion symmetry, it can host chiral topological point degeneracies at time-reversal-invariant momenta.\nEmploying the first-principles method, we numerically calculate the band structures of the 3D photonic crystal, as shown in Fig. 2b\u2013e. The first three bands cross with each other, forming a maximally charged WP at \u0393 (red dots), three charge-2 WPs at M (green dots), a charge-2 triple point at R (blue dots), and multiple charge-1 WPs at general momenta (yellow dots). In this work, we mainly focus on the maximally chargedWP that is protected byC3,111,C4 rotation symmetry and time-reversal symmetry \u03c4 of the underlying photonic crystal. The maximally charged WP features a cubical dispersion along the four three-fold rotation axes and a quadratic dispersion along other directions, as shown in Fig. 2b, d. Its 2 \u00d7 2 low-energy effective Hamiltonian around \u0413 can be described by19\nH\u0393 = c1 + c2k 2 +\nk2x + k 2 y 2k2zffiffi 3 p c3 c3 k 2 x k2y + ic4kxkykz\nc3 k 2 x k2y\nic4kxkykz\nk2x + k 2 y 2k2zffiffi 3 p c3\n2 64\n3 75,\nwhere ci (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are real parameters, and k = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi k2x + k 2 y + k 2 z q (see Supplementary Notes 4, 5 and 6 for the symmetry analysis and\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7359 3\neffective Hamiltonian descriptions). By employing the Wilson loop method, we numerically confirm that the topological charge of the maximally charged WP is \u22124 (see Supplementary Note 7). Besides, our photonic crystal hosts the charge-2 triple point at R (see Fig. 2e). Its low-energy effective Hamiltonian denotesHR = c5 + c6 k\u22c5Lwith ci (i = 5, 6) being real parameters and L = {Lx, Ly, Lz} being the spin-1 matrix representation (see Supplementary Note 4). The first-principles calculation manifests that the topological charges of the triple point at R and the charge-2 WPs at M are \u22122 and +2, respectively (see Supplementary Note 7). Therefore, for the first band, the total topological charge is zero, which is consistent with the no-go theorem24.\nExperimental observation of the maximally charged WP and its quadruple-helicoid surface states Due to the self-supporting architecture of our photonic crystal, the sample is directly fabricated via metallic additive manufacturing without relying on supporting structures. Thematerial is stainless steel (316 L) with relatively high conductivity atmicrowave frequencies, and the sample has 17 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 10 unit cells, as shown in Fig. 3a.\nNext, we perform microwave pump-probe measurements to determine the projected bulk dispersion. As schematically shown in Fig. 3b, the point-like source is horizontally inserted into the fifth layer through the air holes of the 3D photonic crystal, to excite the bulk modes. We also vertically thread an electric dipole antenna into different layers to probe the field distributions on (001) surface. The amplitude and phase of the local fields at each frequency are collected by a vector network analyser (VNA). Thefield distributions are scanned point by point with a spatial resolution of 15mm in both [100] and [010] directions (see Supplementary Fig. 14).\nWe focus on the projected bulk dispersion along the highsymmetry line \u0393 X M \u0393, which is obtained by projecting the 3D band structure onto the kx-ky plane. Consequently, the maximally charged WP is projected onto the centre of the surface Brillouin zone (i.e., \u0393), while two charge-2 WPs are projected onto the edge centre of the surface Brillouin zone (e.g., X). One charge-2 WP and the charge-2 triple point are projected onto the corner of the surface Brillouin zone (i.e., M). By applying the 2D spatial Fourier transform to the real-space complex field distributions, we obtain the projected bulk dispersion, as shown inFig. 3c. For reference, the numerically-calculatedprojected bulk dispersion is also plotted, which is marked by the grey curves in Fig. 3c. One can see that the experimental results roughly match the simulated counterparts.\nTo confirm the topological charge of the maximally charged WP, we use surface measurement to probe the field distributions on the\nsample\u2019s (001) surface. The experimental configuration is shown in Fig. 4a, where the source (probe) lies on the second (first) layer of the sample. After Fourier-transforming the field data from real space to reciprocal space, the resulting intensity map of the surface dispersion along high-symmetry line \u0393 X M \u0393 is directly compared with the numerical results, as shown in Fig. 4b. It is evident that the topological surface states residing in bandgaps are consistently seen in both simulated (green curves) and experimental data from 3.7 to 4.5GHz. Note that, apart from the topological surface states, a trivial surface mode exists at low frequencies (blue curve).\nThe topological charges of the maximally charged WP and the charge-2 WPs can be verified from the measured surface isofrequency contours at the frequencies ranging from 3.7 to 4.5 GHz (see Fig. 4d\u2013m). One can observe the quadruple (double) helicoid surface sheets of the topological surface states wind around \u0393 ( X or Y). It is obvious from the measured results that, at a fixed frequency (e.g., 4.1 GHz), four Fermi arcs connect \u0393 and X or Y, proving that the topological charge of the maximally charged WP projected to \u0393 is indeed 4. Besides, two Fermi arcs from X or Y indicate the topological charge of the charge-2 WP projected to X or Y is 2. The topological charge at M is 0, owing to the charge offset between the third charge-2 WP (C = +2) and the charge-2 triple point (C = \u22122). One can also see that the four Fermi arcs collapse at the centre of the Brillouin zone at 4.5 GHz, where the gaps between the bulk iso-frequency contours enclosing the maximally charged WP at \u0393 and the charge-2 WPs at M are closed. Thus, no Fermi arc states are observed above 4.5GHz. Note that, since the charge-1 WPs involve the second and the third bulk bands, they do not affect the profiles of the above iso-frequency contours of Fermi arc states that exist in the gaps between the projections of the first and the second bulk bands. Besides, the double Fermi arcs of the charge-2 triple point are in principle accessible by projecting the triple point onto the (101) surface (see Supplementary Note 9).\nRemarkably, the quadruple Fermi arcs wrap around the torus of the surface Brillouin zone, forming double noncontractible loops (see the right panel of Fig. 1d). Compared to the generally short Fermi arcs in conventional charge-1Weyl crystals, the unconventional double noncontractible loops exhibit long topological Fermi arcs spanning a large area of the surface Brillouin zone, especially from 4.0 to 4.3GHz in our case (see Fig. 4h\u2013k). Mathematically, closed loops on a 2D surface Brillouin zone torus T2 = S1 \u00d7 S1 can be classified by its funda-\nmental homotopy group \u03c01 T 2 ffi \u03c01 S1 L \u03c01 S 1 =Z L Z,\nlabeled by two integers that indicate the number of times the loop winds around two orthogonal directions of the surface Brillouin zone, respectively.

One can see that the connectivity of the quadruple-helicoid arcs varies as the frequency increases (see Fig. 4d\u2013n). Around 3.92 GHz, the helicoid arcs touch, forming saddle-like dispersions with the saddle points corresponding to the type-II van Hove singularities (see Fig. 4g, o). We also plot the DOS of the topological surface states in Fig. 4p, which shows a singularity at the frequency of the saddle point. Unlike their type-I counterparts constrained to reside at time-reversal-invariant momenta, the type-II van Hove singularities found here can locate at arbitrary momenta, which have not been demonstrated experimentally thus far23,25. Currently, the van Hove singularities are under active investigation in condensed-matter systems, such as twisted bilayer graphene26,27, due to their electronic instabilities that lead to many unusual correlation effects (e.g., superconductivity). In particular, the type-II van Hove singularities are of great importance for realising topological odd superconductivity23. In photonics, the divergent DOS associated with the van Hove singularities can significantly enhance light-matter interaction, which is crucial for lasing, sensing, and quantum optics28. Therefore, we have demonstrated the long-pursued type-II van Hove singularities in a photonic topological medium."

The consequent quadruple-helicoid Fermi arcs emanating from the maximally charged WP are mapped out, which wrap around the surface Brillouin zone forming unprecedented double noncontractible loops. Our work establishes an ideal photonic platform for exploring novel physical phenomena related to the maximally charged WP, such as multiple chiral Landau levels29, quantised circulation of the spatial shift in interface scattering30, and unusual electromagnetic scattering near the WP31. Besides, our findings open the door to studying the potential applications of conventional and unconventional van Hove singularities, such as lasing and sensing, in the topological photonic media. When considering a super cell, the charge-2 triple point can be folded to \u0393, providing a route to symmetry-enforced 3D metamaterials with vanishing refraction index22. Our work also offers a good opportunity to investigate exoticphenomena and realistic applications arising from the interplay between different types of topological nodal points in a single platform. Finally, our work will inspire research on the maximally charged topological band degeneracies in other physical settings, such as phononics, magnonics, and spinless electronics (see an acoustic design of the maximally charged WP in Supplementary Note 11)."
