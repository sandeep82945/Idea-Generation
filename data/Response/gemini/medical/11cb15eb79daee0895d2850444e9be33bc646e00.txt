1. **Investigate the role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the shedding of Klotho and its impact on CKD-induced CVD.** Klotho is a vasculoprotective protein that is shed by ADAM10 and ADAM17. Studies have shown that high levels of FGF23, which interacts with Klotho, are associated with increased CV risk in CKD patients. It would be interesting to investigate whether the shedding of Klotho by ADAM10/17 contributes to CKD-induced CVD and whether Klotho supplementation could be a potential therapeutic strategy.


2. **Explore the role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their impact on CKD-induced CVD.** EVs are mediators of CVD and systemic vascular calcification in CKD. ADAMs can modulate EV composition and function by their shedding activity and/or by being present themselves in EVs, affecting target cell responses such as endothelial (dys)function and VSMC calcification. It would be interesting to investigate the role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the release of EVs and their impact on CKD-induced CVD.


3. **Investigate the role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the shedding of chemokines and its impact on CKD-induced CVD.** ADAM10 and ADAM17 can shed chemokines such as CXCL16 and CX3CL1, which play a role in leukocyte recruitment and inflammation. It would be interesting to investigate the role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the shedding of chemokines and its impact on CKD-induced CVD.


4. **Explore the potential of ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibitors as therapeutic targets for CKD-induced CVD.** Given the role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in CKD-induced CVD, it would be interesting to investigate the potential of ADAM10 and ADAM17 inhibitors as therapeutic targets. This could involve the development of small molecule inhibitors or the use of gene therapy to knockdown ADAM10 and ADAM17 expression.


5. **Investigate the role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the shedding of other mediators of CKD-induced CVD.** ADAM10 and ADAM17 can shed a variety of other mediators that could potentially contribute to CKD-induced CVD. These include growth factors, cytokines, and adhesion molecules. It would be interesting to investigate the role of ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the shedding of these other mediators and their impact on CKD-induced CVD.
