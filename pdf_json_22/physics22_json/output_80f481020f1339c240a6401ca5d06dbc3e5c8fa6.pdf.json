    "abstractText": "In this article, complete synchronization and antisynchronization in the identical financial chaotic system are presented. +e proposed control strategies depend on first-order sliding mode and adaptive integral sliding mode for complete synchronization and antisynchronization of the identical financial chaotic system. In the primary case, the system parameters should be known, and first-order sliding mode control is utilized for synchronization and antisynchronization while in the second case, the system parameters are considered unknown. An adaptive integral sliding mode control strategy is utilized for synchronization and antisynchronization of the system considering the parameters unknown. +e error system is changed into a particular structure containing a nominal part and several unknown terms to utilize the adaptive integral slidingmode control.+en, this error system is stabilized using integral sliding mode control. +e stabilizing controller is usually developed based on the nominal part plus the compensator control part. To suppress the high-frequency oscillation (chattering) phenomenon, smooth continuous compensator control can be used rather than conventional discontinuous control. +e compensator controller along with the adapted law is derived such that the time derivative of the Lyapunov function becomes strictly negative.+e effectiveness of the proposedmethod was tested through computer simulations.+e proposed control strategies are verified for that Identical 4D hyperchaotic financial system to attain complete synchronization and antisynchronization along with the improved performance.",

Introduction\nChaos theory plays an important role in nonlinear control theory. Chaotic synchronization and antisynchronization have gained considerable importance in the domain of biological systems, chemical reactions, secure communication, information sciences, plasma technology, and most important of all, financial systems [1\u20133]. +e hyperchaotic systems are very sensitive towards initial conditions and possess at least two positive Lyapunov exponents. It has bounded trajectories in the phase space and exhibits more\ncomplex nonlinear behavior. Hyperchaos was first formalized in 1979 by Rossler [4]. Many other hyperchaotic systems were reported later on [5\u20137]. In 1990, Pecora and Carroll [8] introduced the synchronization of two identical chaotic systems with different initial conditions. Later, synchronization of chaotic systems was extensively studied in the last two decades, and many schemes were proposed for synchronization, which includes lag synchronization [9, 10], inverse lag synchronization [11], complete synchronization [12, 13], inverse \u03c0-lag synchronization [14], multiple chaotic systems synchronization [15, 16], partial\nHindawi Complexity Volume 2022, Article ID 4272138, 27 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/4272138\nsynchronization [17, 18], generalized synchronization [19\u201321], projective synchronization [22], Q-S synchronization [20, 23], phase synchronization [24], antisynchronization [25, 26], and fractional chaos synchronization [27].\nIn recent years, financial chaotic systems have been widely investigated due to their globally socioeconomically importance. Researchers are still exploring the new dimensions regarding synchronization and antisynchronization of financial chaotic systems, which is also considered an attractive idea of this era [27\u201330]. Since the fundamental chaotic financial models proposed in the literature from [31\u201337], like the Kaldorian model is listed at [31] and the IS-LM model as [32, 33], the hyperchaotic financial model is considered as [34]; moreover, the other nonlinear dynamical models are cited at [35\u201337]. External uncertainties arising from different environmental factors can cause the destabilization of chaotic financial systems and lead to undesirable effects [38\u201340]. +e global stabilization and synchronization of chaotic financial systems in the presence of external uncertainty are necessary and have been the topic of excellent research works [41, 42]. As the financial systems are directly linked with our daily lives [29], chaos will occur when economic crises happen (like 2007). While the globalization and technology have opened new horizons of the international trade and economic cooperation among the states, these have also exposed the economic and financial systems to uncertainties and risks of unprecedented nature. One investment bank (Abraj Capital) filing bankruptcy can bring the whole system to a halt and hibernation stage.+e economic crisis of 2007, which brought whole world trade to its knees, still echoes in the financial sector.\n+e macroeconomic landscape of a country depends upon the interaction of demand, supply, discount rates, savings, and investments. In the macroeconomic literature, the determinants of investments are not the same as the determinants of savings particularly, in the regions where capital mobility in the markets for loan-able funds is reasonably frictionless. Growth in the economy depends on investments which, on the other hand, depend upon the savings in the economy. It is important to note that investment and interest rates have a negative relationship while savings increase with the high-interest rates. +e neoclassical economists consider that the growth-led monetary policy would focus upon themeasures to increase the growth fueled by more investments, hence increasing the savings in the economy. +ey argue that measures to increase savings hamper economic expansion because it creates a demand deficit and pushes interest rates upwards, resulting in crowding out of the investments. Hence, investments bring down the demand deficit, increase growth, and result in higher savings.\n+e complex relationship of abovementioned economic variables and taking account of all such variables open the door for the applications of 3D and 4D hyperchaotic fractional systems. In this regard, stability and synchronization of the fractional chaotic model are proposed by Shahiri et al. in [43]. Kumar and Kumar proposed the stability analysis of the aforementioned model using the Lyapunov direct method in [44]. Xu and He studied the synchronization of the financial model by using an active control method [45].\nAs said earlier, hyperchaotic systems possess complex dynamical behavior due to more than one positive Lyapunov exponent and their expansion in more than one direction. Considering the aforementioned scenario, it is very much mandatory for every government to take preventive measures before the outbreak of chaos. +e dynamics of a financial system play a significant role in the growth and development of an economic system. However, a financial system\u2019s dynamics depend on the multiple input variables in a highly complex and nonlinear fashion. A financial system, even if deterministic, can exhibit and initiate chaotic behavior. Since a chaotic system is more sensitive towards small changes and errors in parameters, their synchronization and antisynchronization are important from a control point of view.\nAs a control researcher, we know that the robust stabilization is one of the fundamental problem in control theory. It is considered to be more challenging because no such standard method exists for general nonlinear systems. In this regard, a control approach for complete synchronization and antisynchronization of an identical financial chaotic system is presented in this work. +e sliding mode control (SMC) strategy is applied on the financial chaotic model when the system parameters are known; however, the adaptive integral sliding mode control (AISMC) approach is used for the case when the system\u2019s parameters are unknown. Moreover, in conventional SMC, the problem of chattering and uncertainty in reaching phase may lead towards total system failure. Many researchers proposed several solutions like integrating SMC with back-steeping and using higher-order SMC to suppress the chattering. However, in order to solve the reaching phase problem, the proposed (AISMC) technique is quite effective. In the said approach, the reaching phase starts from the very beginning, resulting the closed loop system which becomes very robust since the first time instant. +e proposed control strategy ensures the robust finite-time convergence in addition to the elimination of reaching phase with mitigation of the highfrequency phenomenon (known as chattering). In practical systems, robust convergence andmitigation of chattering are really appreciable. Numerical simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies.\n+e rest of this paper is organized as follows; Section 2 presents preliminaries regarding synchronization. Section 3 displays the dynamical model and proposed methodologies regarding sliding mode control (SMC) and adaptive integral sliding mode control (AISMC) design for the known and unknown parameters cases. +e simulation results and discussion are posed in Section 4. Section 5 presents the conclusion. +e references cited are listed at last.\n2. Systems Description and Preliminaries\n+is section presents the dynamical model of an identical 4D hyperchaotic financial system along with the concepts of complete synchronization and antisynchronization. +e financial chaotic systems have attracted a substantial amount of attraction from researchers in recent years. +e financial systems are involved with the existence [29]. As we know,\neconomic crises result in chaos (like 2007). +e dynamics of the financial system play a significant role while in the continuing build-out of the economic system. +e dynamics of any financial system rely on multiple input variables in an incredibly complex and nonlinear fashion. +e financial system, even though deterministic, can exhibit chaotic behavior. Since a chaotic system might be more responsive to minor errors and alterations in parameters, their synchronization is vital, originating from a control reason for view.\nIn this work, the authors have presented synchronization and antisynchronization of identical 4D hyperchaotic financial systems. +e response strategy is taken like a perturbed system by some bounded external disturbances. Two cases are believed to be as follows:\n(1) System Parameters Are Known. In this case, the synchronization and antisynchronization are achieved using first-order sliding mode control\n(2) System Parameters Are Unknown. In this case, the adaptive integral sliding mode control is used to achieve synchronization and antisynchronization and estimate the system parameters\nIn 2012, a new hyperchaotic finance system was suggested. +e model is expressed by the admirer\u2019s 4D hyperchaotic financial system [34].

Moreover, a, b, and c represent the saving amount, cost per investment, and elasticity of demand of commercial markets, respectively, where d and k represent some system\u2019s parameters. a, b, c, d, and k are positive constants (a, b, c, d, and k> 0). +e slave system in this regard may be displayed as follows:\n_y1 \ufffd y3 + y2 \u2212 a( y1 + y4 + u1, _y2 \ufffd 1 \u2212 by2 \u2212 y 2 1 + u2,\n_y3 \ufffd \u2212 y1 \u2212 cy3 + u3,\n_y4 \ufffd \u2212 dy1y2 \u2212 ky4 + u4.\n(2)\n+e system parameters a, b, c, d, and k are selected as 0.9, 0.2, 1.5, 0.2, and0.17, respectively, with these parameters system (2) exhibiting chaotic behavior.\n3.

Conclusion\nIn the current era, we all know the importance of economic and financial stability. Stability of the financial system guaranties the social and economical development. Investments for the development of any financial/economic system purely depend on the stable financial system. However, after the financial globalization, financial stability becomes a highly complex nonlinear system. Minor parametric uncertainty may lead towards a chaos in any financial stable system, which may result turbulence in financial market and financial crises. +e macroeconomic landscape of a country depends upon the interaction of demand, supply, discount rates, savings, and investments. +e complex relationship of the abovementioned economic variables and taking account of all such variables open the door for the applications of 4D hyperchaotic fractional systems. According to the basic financial theory, this paper presents the controller for the\nsynchronization and antisynchronization of identical 4D hyperchaotic financial systems with external perturbations (which is quite complex to handle). Conventional SMC is employed for known parameters; however, to counter the aforementioned unknown parametric variation, AISMC control strategy is applied, which makes the system more responsive and robust (from the initial time instant) due to the absence of reaching phase. Moreover, it provides comprehensive suppression in the chattering phenomenon. +e stability analysis is also performed, and the time derivative of the Lyapunov function proved strictly negative. +e effectiveness of the proposed approaches can be confirmed via simulation results displayed in the previous section, which clearly indicated the adaptive integral sliding mode controller versatility over hyperchaotic financial system efficiently. Simulation results also proved the suggested technique outshines even in the presence of the system modelling uncertainties with unknown parameters.\nData Availability\n+e data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\nConflicts of Interest\n+e authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.\nReferences\n[1] T.
