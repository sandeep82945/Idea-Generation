This dramatic steepening f the halo star counts was interpreted by Deason et al. ( 2013 ) to onclude that the accretion history of the Galaxy had been dominated y a single, ancient, and massive merger. This hypothesis was tested ith the arri v al of the Gaia data (Gaia Collaboration 2016 ), which\nevealed the prevalence in the inner halo of the Milky Way of elatively metal-rich stars on highly eccentric orbits, attributed to dwarf galaxy with a total mass of order of 10 11 M accreted some \u201311 Gyr ago (Belokurov et al. 2018 ; Helmi et al. 2018 ). This merger vent, kno wn today as Gaia Sausage/Enceladus (GS/E), has by now een mapped out in the chemical and kinematic space (e.g. Haywood t al. 2018 ; Lancaster et al. 2019 ; Mackereth et al. 2019 ; Necib, isanti & Belokurov 2019 ; Das, Hawkins & Jofr \u0301e 2020 ; Feuillet et al. 021 ; Carrillo et al. 2022 ). Taking advantage of the unprecedented uality of Gaia \u2019s astrometry, the stellar halo break has been shown\nE-mail: vasily@ast.cam.ac.uk\nn o\nPub\no be created by the apocentric pile-up of GS/E stars turning around n their orbits (Deason et al. 2018 ). The global 3D shape of the Milky Way\u2019s inner halo has been harted with the RR Lyrae stars and shown to be triaxial with a ajor axis lying in the plane of the Galactic disc more or less aligned ith the crossing of the orbital plane of the Magellanic Clouds (Iorio t al. 2018 ). Subsequently, using the Gaia Data Release 2 proper otions, Iorio & Belokurov ( 2019 ) demonstrated that the bulk of he RR Lyrae inside 30 kpc of the Galactic Centre mo v e on similar, ighly radial orbits and are likely all part of the same accretion vent, namely the GS/E. Viewed projected onto the x \u2212 z plane, the ntermediate axis of the inner stellar halo is slightly tilted out of the alactic disc plane (see fig. 3 of Iorio & Belokurov 2019 ). The Sun\u2019s osition is only \u223c20 \u25e6 off the intermediate axis, but this is enough to ee the close side of the debris cloud, spanning a larger projection on he sky compared to the one further away, in effect similar to the sky rojection of the Galactic bar. The outer density contours show clear eviations from the simple ellipsoidal shape corresponding to the re viously kno wn debris \u2018clouds\u2019 (Simion, Belokuro v & Koposo v 019 ; Balbinot & Helmi 2021 ). There have been several early signs that at least in the Solar eighbourhood, the GS/E tidal debris dominate the accreted portion f the stellar halo (e.g. Brook et al. 2003 ; Meza et al. 2005 ; Nissen &\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s) lished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\nS a e t s t T e e ( i 2\nn w ( t o a s p t s t f p i ( b w c i a t t h s a r c l S\nt s V e f o t l s t c H f p m i e L d\nt ( A g a a t e t\nt o e t p o b s H t o c s r A i v b ( ( r a 2 A t E a e o e L i\nt b A i d d n M g s n t e a b M 2 b s\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/4/6200/6847223 by U niversity of D urham user on 11 M ay 2023\nchuster 2010 ). Today, the dominance of the GS/E debris locally nd throughout the inner MW halo has been well established. For xample, most recently, Myeong et al. ( 2022 ) demonstrated that he GS/E is the only significant accreted component amongst local tars on eccentric orbits. Curiously, three other halo components hey find are all of in situ nature, i.e. born in the MW proper. hese include Splash , i.e. heated high- \u03b1 disc of the Galaxy (Bonaca t al. 2017 ; Di Matteo et al. 2019 ; Gallart et al. 2019 ; Belokurov t al. 2020 ), Aurora , i.e. the pre-disc quasi-spheroidal early Galaxy Belokurov & Kravtsov 2022 ; Conroy et al. 2022 ), and Eos , a new n situ halo component linked to the low- \u03b1 disc (see Myeong et al. 022 ). The census of the most significant substructures in the Solar eighbourhood reported by Myeong et al. ( 2022 ) can be interpreted ith the detailed analysis of a massive satellite in-fall. Amorisco 2017 ) and Vasiliev, Belokurov & Evans ( 2022 ) demonstrate that if he satellite-host mass ratio is sufficiently high, for a certain range f central densities of the two galaxies, the interaction proceeds in n unexpected and previously poorly understood way. Instead of inking in the host\u2019s potential with ever-increasing circularity as redicted by the Chandrasekhar\u2019s Dynamical Friction (DF) prescripion (Chandrasekhar 1943 ; Pe \u0303 narrubia, Just & Kroupa 2004 ), the atellite\u2019s orbital eccentricity rapidly ramps up causing it to stall, drop o the centre of the host, and fall apart in an accelerated, e xplosiv e ashion. This is not the first time the inadequacy of the Chandrasekhar rescription has been exposed (see e.g. Quinn & Goodman 1986 , for nteractions with discs and spirals). Most recently, Vasiliev et al. 2022 ) showed that the satellite\u2019s orbital radialization is caused y a complex mix of distortion and reflex motion of the host as ell as satellite\u2019s self-friction. These factors, not considered in the lassical DF picture, help the satellite to sink and disrupt faster, thus nundating the Solar neighbourhood with its debris. The satellite\u2019s nd the host\u2019s properties need to be just right for the radialization o happen efficiently. If, for example, the central density is too low, he disruption happens too quickly, before the satellite arrives to the eart of the Milky Way. Dialling the densities up will reduce the atellite\u2019s mass loss and therefore will lessen the self-friction. It will lso subdue the reflex motion and consequently will slow down the adialization or even completely reverse it. Profound radialization an thus be considered a giv ea way that the satellite survived more or ess intact (at least its stellar component) until arriving close to the olar neighbourhood. For a progenitor whose orbit does not evolve significantly during he disruption, the tidal debris behaviour is best summarized in the pace of integrals of motion (Johnston 1998 ; Helmi & White 1999 ). iewed either in the action space (Eyre & Binney 2011 ) or in the nergy and angular momentum space, stars stripped from the inalling galaxy form characteristic bow-tie shapes (see e.g. fig. 1 f Gibbons, Belokurov & Evans 2014 ). The opposite ends of the ie are the leading and the trailing debris, with correspondingly ower and higher energy compared to the progenitor. While these hapes get somewhat smeared by both the host\u2019s evolution o v er ime and the measurement errors, they remain recognizable and an be used to decipher the accretion history of the Galaxy (see elmi & de Zeeuw 2000 ). The situation is much more complex or a rapidly sinking satellite. In this case, how fast the satellite lunges in the host\u2019s potential and the rate at which it loses stellar ass and angular momentum will now control the appearance of ts tidal debris. While for a stationary orbit, the debris unbound at ach stripping episode contributes to the same footprint in e.g. ( E , z ) space, the bow-tie shape of a plunging satellite is constantly istorted and dragged to lower energies. As a result, this leads to\nhe formation of a twisted and stretched (along E ) column of debris see e.g. Jean-Baptiste et al. 2017 ; Koppelman, Bos & Helmi 2020 ; marante et al. 2022 ; Khoperskov et al. 2022 ). It is therefore a eneric expectation that the energy distribution of the tidal debris of satellite on a rapidly decaying orbit should contain multiple bumps nd wrinkles corresponding to the individual stripping episodes along he satellite\u2019s journey down the potential well. Moreover, each such pisode should produce at least two energy pile-ups, corresponding o the leading and trailing debris.\nOnce packs of stripped stars are deposited into the host\u2019s gravitaional potential, in principle, their distribution in the space of integrals f motion barely changes, but their phase-space density constantly volves. Small dif ferences in stars\u2019 orbital frequencies e ventually ranslate into orbital phase offsets that accumulate with time in the rocess known as phase-mixing. As the stellar debris cloud spreads v er the Milky Way, the increase of its spatial extent is balanced y the thinning out of the velocity distribution, keeping the phasepace density constant in accordance with Liouville\u2019s theorem (see elmi & White 1999 ). As the debris cloud continues to stretch in he phase-space, it eventually folds onto itself leading to a formation f a winding pattern, which resembles a spiral for orbits close to ircular. Such phase-space spiral was unco v ered recently in the disc tars around the Sun and is believed to be produced by a relatively ecent perturbation of the Galactic disc by a massive body (see ntoja et al. 2018 ). For an eccentric orbit, as viewed for example n the phase-space spanned by the Galactocentric spherical polars r and r , the folds of the debris cloud appear as nested chevrons, ut topologically are none the less a spiral, albeit severely distorted e.g. fig. 6 of Quinn ( 1984 ) and section 8.5 of Binney & Tremaine 2008 )). In the early stages of phase-mixing, the chevrons expand adially, while creating sharp, caustic-like density enhancements round their apocentric radii known as shells (Sanderson & Helmi 013 ). Each stripping episode creates its own set of connected folds. s folds seeded at different times stretch, thin out, and e xpand, the y end to run into each other and o v erlap (see Dong-P \u0301aez, Vasiliev & vans 2022 ), creating something akin to super-chevrons. Not only re the phase-space chevrons a well known and a theoretically xpected symptom of incomplete phase mixing, there exist multiple bservational examples of their presence in external galaxies (see .g. Ebrov \u0301a et al. 2012 ; Romanowsky et al. 2012 ; Foster et al. 2014 ; ongobardi et al. 2015 ). Note, ho we ver, that none have been reported n the halo of the Milky Way to date. Thanks to phase-mixing, the coarse-grained phase-space substrucure, i.e. lumps left behind by each episode of tidal stripping, is roken down into finer folded filaments and is, eventually, erased. t later stages, the phase-space density appears more uniform but s in fact made up of tightly packed series of folds. These may be ifficult or impossible to tell apart when the entirety of the tidal ebris is analysed. Ho we ver, if a small spatial region, e.g. the Solar eighbourhood, is isolated, individual folds can be revealed (see cMillan & Binney 2008 ; G \u0301omez & Helmi 2010 ). This is because iven the same (or similar) time of release from the parent, only tars with certain orbital frequencies will have completed the right umber of orbits around the Milky Way to enter the region around he Sun. Therefore, spatially localized views of the tidal debris in ither phase-space or any space spanned by integrals of motion is l w ays expected to be lumpy. The size of the clumps and the spacing etween them can in fact be used to deduce the time of accretion (see cMillan & Binney 2008 ; G \u0301omez & Helmi 2010 ; Jean-Baptiste et al. 017 ). Alternatively, the gravitational potential can be constrained y the requirement to bring the integrals of motion clumps into a harp focus (Dong-P \u0301aez et al. 2022 ).\nMNRAS 518, 6200\u20136215 (2023)\nM\n-2 -1 0 1 2 Lz 10-3\n-1.6\n-1.4\n-1.2\n-1.0\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4 E log density\n-2 -1 0 1 2 Lz 10-3\n-1.6\n-1.4\n-1.2\n-1.0\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\nE\nEnergy coloured\n-2 -1 0 1 2 Lz 10-3\n-1.6\n-1.4\n-1.2\n-1.0\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\nE\nlog background\n-2 -1 0 1 2 Lz 10-3\n-1.6\n-1.4\n-1.2\n-1.0\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\nE\nlog difference\n-2 -1 0 1 2 Lz 10-3\n-1.6\n-1.4\n-1.2\n-1.0\n-0.8\n-0.6 -0.4 E linear difference\n-1.4 -1.2 -1.0 -0.8 E\n10\n100\nEnergy slices\nFigure 1.

We apply only basic selection cuts, i.e e require that stars have a relative precision better than 10 per cent\n/ \u03c3 > 10), and that they lie not too far from the Sun at D < 15 kpc, eaving \u223c25.9 million objects out of the original \u223c33.7 million ith non-zero line-of-sight velocities. Additionally, we remove stars rojected within 1.5 degree distance from the centres of known lobular clusters within 5 kpc of the Sun. Our final sample size is 25 million stars with full 6D phase-space information. Converting he observed heliocentric stellar coordinates into the Galactocentric eft-handed reference frame, we assume that the Sun is at X = R = kpc from the Galactic Centre (although a slightly larger value as recently reported by Gravity Collaboration 2022 ) and lies in the alactic plane, at Z = 0. Following Gaia Collaboration ( 2022 ), we ssume that the Sun\u2019s velocity is v = { \u2212 9.3, 251.5, 8.59 } km s \u22121 . e have checked that changing any of the Galactic parameters within heir systematic uncertainties does not change any of the conclusions eported below.\nE N E R G Y W R I N K L E S\nig. 1 presents the behaviour of the local Gaia DR3 RVS stars in he space spanned by the total energy E and the vertical component f the angular momentum L z .

We use a slightly higher concentration of the DM halo ( c = 9.5) to match the circular velocity at the Solar radius v circ = 235 km \u22121 . Energy is in units of 10 5 km 2 s \u22122 . The top-left panel of the gure shows the logarithm of the stellar density distribution with a rominent vertical structure around L z = 0 corresponding to the GS/E idal debris. A noticeable retrograde clump at L z < \u221210 3 and E > \u22121 s the Sequoia structure (Matsuno, Aoki & Suda 2019 ; Myeong et al. 019 ). Note that adopting a different gravitational potential for the alaxy may shift the patterns discussed below up and down slightly ut is not going to change our o v erall conclusions.\nTo reveal the density variations across the GS/E debris cloud, we stimate the behaviour of the smooth (well mixed) background as ollows. In the L z range marked by two vertical dotted lines ( | L z | 0.85 \u00d7 10 3 , left-hand panel of Fig. 1 ), the density is linearly nterpolated using the values just outside the region of interest. To mooth the background variation, for each E bin considered, we odel the average of 9 L z profiles, i.e. additionally considering four ows of pixels above and below the current one. The background epresents the well-mixed component of the local stellar halo. The ulk of this background component is contributed by the in situ alo for which the assumption of mixedness may well be a good ne: the in situ halo stars are either already more phase-mixed e.g. Splash ) or have had the longest to phase-mix (e.g. Aurora ). ubtracting the distribution shown in the right-hand panel of the top ow of Fig. 1 from that shown in the left gives the difference of he logarithms of stellar densities (data-background) displayed in the ottom-left panel. The bottom-middle panel of the figure shows the inear o v erdensity residual. Note that giv en the choice of the size of he interpolated region, the background estimate is only valid down to nergies of order of E \u2248\u22121.65. Curiously, the residual corresponding o the GS/E only reaches E \u2248 \u22121.4. This could indicate a genuine rop in the number of GS/E stars at lo w energies, or, alternati vely, roblems with our background estimate below E = \u22121.4. The topight panel of Fig. 1 indicates that the latter is indeed possible as the ackground quickly gets quite complex at low energies due to (i) the ontribution of the in situ halo and (ii) the Gaia DR3 RVS selection iases. If there are any stars belonging to the merger at lower energies, hey are not contributing to the GS/E signal analysed in this section. he majority of other known (lower mass) halo substructures do not ontribute many stars to the L z range of interest (e.g. Myeong et al. 018 , 2019 ; Koppelman et al. 2019 ). In the E , L z space, the 2D GS/E o v erdensity (Fig. 1 , bottom ow, left, and middle; also contours in the top-middle panel) has an longated and inclined shape: its top portion (at high energy) leans owards L z > 0, while its bottom portion is more or less symmetric ith respect to L z = 0, with a slight preference towards L z < 0. We nterpret the inclination of the debris cloud in Section 5.2 and link t to the original angular momentum of the satellite at the in-fall. he debris cloud is also lumpy with a number of small-scale features uch as (i) a core at L z = 0 and E \u2248 \u22121.4, i.e. the bottom edge f the energy distribution, and (ii) an energy depletion around E \u223c 1.1, i.e. approximately through the middle of the o v erdensity; this ent is most visible in the prograde portion of the cloud, i.e. at L z 0. The shape of the ( E , L z ) o v erdensity resembles an a v ocado, ith the bulk of the stars residing in the \u2018pit\u2019 in the broad bottom art of the debris cloud. The asymmetric, lopsided distribution of S/E energies could potentially be an artefact of the background ubtraction where some of the sharp density variations (to do with he contribution of the in situ halo and the Gaia DR3 RVS selection unction) have not been absorbed by the model. Ho we ver, on close\nnspection, in the ( E , L z ) distribution shown in the top-left panel of he figure, no clear o v erdensity centred on L z = 0 below E \u2248 \u22121.4 s visible. Therefore, the bottom-heavy energy distribution may be a enuine feature of the GS/E debris cloud and a direct observational vidence for progenitor\u2019s rapid sinking in the host\u2019s potential (see ection 5.2 for a comparison with a tailored N -body simulation). The bottom-right panel of Fig. 1 shows four energy histograms smoothed by convolving with an Epanechnikov kernel with a size of .3 pixel), corresponding to four slices through the GS/E cloud along in the L z bins marked with coloured vertical lines in the previous anel. All four histograms are noticeably asymmetric with peaks t lower energy levels, supporting the a v ocado picture introduced bo v e. Moreo v er, the peak of the most prograde slice (blue) is at ignificantly higher energy compared to the most retrograde slice red), confirming the tilted shape of the debris cloud in the ( E , L z ) pace. While the two profiles corresponding to the lowest | L z | are elati vely smooth (yello w and green), the other two distributions orresponding to the most retrograde (red) and the most prograde blue) edges of the GS/E debris show a number of wiggles. For xample, the retrograde slice peaks just below E \u223c \u22121.3 but has oticeable wrinkles (changes of curvature) between E \u223c \u22121.25 and \u223c \u22121, together with an additional bump around E \u2248 \u22120.8. The rograde edge is clearly bimodal with bumps at E \u223c \u22121.15 and E = \u2212 0.95, on either side of the energy dent mentioned abo v e and everal additional wrinkles. There are multiple reasons why the energy distribution can be\nrinkled. Major o v erdensities are seeded at different energy levels s the disrupting satellite sinks in the host potential, producing at least wo distinct energy clumps at each stripping episode. Additionally, f the tidal debris has had time to phase-mix, limiting stars to a elatively small spatial region would carve out portions of the energy istribution. Finally, subsequent rapid and strong perturbations of the alaxy\u2019s potential can add extra wrinkles to the already complicated icture. We discuss some of these phenomena in Section 5 below.\nPHASE-SPAC E F O L D S\ne now turn to the analysis of the phase-space, which does not epend on the assumptions about the potential. Fig. 2 shows the ( v r , r ) phase-space behaviour of the high-quality ample of the Gaia DR3 RVS stars in the Solar neighbourhood. Here, he top (bottom) row gives the logarithm of stellar density (columnormalized stellar density). The left column shows the phase-space ensity of all stars in the sample, while the middle panel corresponds o the stars selected to have | L z | < 0.7 \u00d7 10 3 , matching the properties f the GS/E debris, as discussed in the previous section. This angular omentum selection gives \u2248270 000 stars on eccentric (halo-like) rbits. The right-hand panel shows the comparison sample with | L z | 10 3 . Hints of a striation pattern are already visible in the left column here lo w-le v el o v erdensities and underdensities mo v e diagonally rom high | v r | at low r to low | v r | at high r . This pattern is amplified n the middle column where the stars within the GS/E\u2019s range of z are selected. We interpret these phase-space feature as folds of he GS/E tidal debris, as it stretches and winds up due to phaseixing in the MW gravitational potential. The patterns in the first wo columns can be compared to the right column where the stars at igher L z are shown. No obvious striation is visible for stars in the omparison sample in the right, indicating that the o v erdensities and nderdensities are not artefacts of Gaia DR3 (e.g. due to the RVS election function).\nFig. 3 splits the GS/E sample into two portions, one with L z 0 (left column) and the other with L z < 0 (middle column).\nMNRAS 518, 6200\u20136215 (2023)\nMNRAS 518, 6200\u20136215 (2023)\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\nV r\nall\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\nV r\nselected\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\nV r\ncomplement\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\nV r\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200 400 V r\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\nV r\nFigure 2.

First, the leading and trailing debris ypically have distinct enough E , L z properties. Secondly, and most mportantly, the in situ halo contamination is a strong function of z , decreasing below L z = 0 (see the top-right panel of Fig. 1 ). he difference in the amount of in situ halo stars in L z > 0 and z < 0 samples is obvious in the first two panels of the top row of ig. 3 . The left-hand panel shows a prominent o v erdensity with | v r | 150 km s \u22121 corresponding to the Splash (with some contribution rom Aurora ), which is almost invisible in the middle panel ( L z < 0). The bottom row of Fig. 3 shows the phase-space density after ubtraction of a smooth background, similar to the view of the disc\u2019s hase-space o v erdensity pattern presented in e.g fig. 6 of Laporte t al. ( 2019 ). The GS/E phase-space folds, i.e. quasi-linear o v erdense nd underdense chevron-like regions are clearly visible in the bottom ow of Fig. 3 . In the L z > 0 view (bottom left), there are two families f chevrons: those limited to V r < 150 km s \u22121 and r < 8 kpc and those ith higher radial velocity amplitude present across the entire range f r . Because the first family is not detected in the L z < 0 sample, e attribute these folds to the in situ stellar halo (see Section 5 for\nurther discussion) and focus the discussion in this section on the igh amplitude chevrons that we number 1\u20135 in the bottom row of ig. 3 . It is clear that while most of these high amplitude chevrons re present in both the L z > 0 and the L z < 0 views, their relative trength is different in the two samples. Chevrons 1, 3, and 4 are best een in the L z > 0 view (left column), while chevrons 2 and 5 stand ut more clearly abo v e the background in the L z < 0 picture (middle anel). Curiously, in terms of the clarity of signal, the ne gativ e v r moving towards the Galactic Centre) portions of the chevron pattern ppear more coherent compared to their positive v r counterparts in oth L z > 0 and L z < 0 samples. The right-hand panel of the bottom ow of the figure combines the L z > 0 and the L z < 0 views and hows at least five clear and tightly packed phase-space folds.\nFig. 4 summarizes the properties of the GS/E phase-space subtructure. The left-hand panel of the figure gives a slice (at 9.0 < (kpc) < 9.5) through the background-subtracted density distributions hown in the bottom row of Fig. 3 . The corresponding velocities of ach fold (as approximated by straight lines in the bottom row of ig. 3 ) are shown as vertical dotted lines. At ne gativ e v r , there is a erfect correspondence both between L z > 0 and L z < 0 slices and the redicted locations of the folds (vertical dotted lines). As mentioned bo v e, all fiv e chevrons are detected in both slices. Moreo v er, chevron\nis bifurcated into two in the L z > 0 view, with only one portion of he bifurcation present in the L z < 0 slice, which could be due to the resence of the in situ stars in the L z > 0 sample. The middle panel f Fig. 4 shows the ( v r , r ) phase-space colour-coded by the median nergy of the stars in each pix el. As e xpected, chevrons run through he phase-space at approximately constant energy. The strongest hevrons 1 and 2 have energies around \u22121.4 and \u22121.2 roughly atching the locations of the strongest peaks in the E distributions hown in the bottom-right panel of Fig. 1 . Finally, the right-hand panel shows the same space colour-coded y the median L z and reveals the alternating positiv e/ne gativ e L z attern of the GS/E folds detected. As the middle panel demonstrates, he phase-space follow (approximately) the lines of constant energy see Dong-P \u0301aez et al. 2022 , for an e xtensiv e discussion). Using a ery crude straight-line fit through the detected folds, as shown in he bottom row of Fig. 3 , we can estimate the apocentric distances of he stars that make up the chevrons. Starting from the lowest energy hevron, the stars in the five folds reach their apocentres around 1.5, 15.5, 21, 23, and 25 kpc from the Galactic centre. Pile-ups of he tidal material in the packs of folds can cause noticeable changes n the stellar halo radial density profile. The last three folds appear o be associated with the stellar halo break detected previously (see .g. Watkins et al. 2009 ; Deason et al. 2011 ; Sesar et al. 2011 ). The hevrons 1 and 2 are likely to introduce another break in the stellar alo density profile, at around 10 < r (kpc) < 15. This is consistent ith the predictions of a \u2018double-break\u2019 halo in Naidu et al. ( 2021 ). Fig. 5 presents a sketch of the phase-space properties of the GS/E ebris. Following the notation introduced in the previous figures, the etected chevrons are shown in blue ( L z > 0) and red ( L z < 0) colour. heir behaviour is compared to the o v erall shape of the radial velocity istribution as given by thin grey lines marking the 0.5, 2, 5, 10, 20 nd 99.5, 98, 95, 90, 80 percentiles of the V r velocity as a function f r . Dotted (solid) lines are for all stars with | L z | < 0.5 \u00d7 10 3 retrograde stars with \u22120.5 \u00d7 10 3 < L z < 0). The amplitude of the adial velocity variation mapped by dotted lines reaches maximum round 5 kpc from the Galactic centre, while the solid curves reach the eak at around 3 kpc. We surmise that the difference in the behaviour s due to the contribution of the in situ halo (see the discussion in ection 5.1 ), which is significantly lower for the retrograde selection. verall, the evolution in the radial velocity amplitude matches the ehaviour of the detected chevrons. This can be compared to the nferred radial velocity shape of the GS/E debris as mapped by the\nMNRAS 518, 6200\u20136215 (2023)\nM\n0 5 10 15 20 25 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\nV r\nFigure 5.

The radial velocity model of Iorio & Belokurov ( 2021 ) s bi-modal, similar to that used in Lancaster et al. ( 2019 ) and Necib t al. ( 2019 ). The v r distribution is approximated by two Gaussians hose separation in km s \u22121 is allowed to vary with Galactocentric adius to mimic the phase-space density of a radial merger. The two rey bands in Fig. 5 show the inferred locations of the centres of he two Gaussians. As the stars on eccentric orbits approach their ericentres, their radial velocity reaches its maximal value before ropping quickly at the turn-around radius. Thus for the GS/E debris, he maximal v r amplitude is expected to be reached close to the v erall debris pericentre. The trends in v r ( r ) shape reported here nd by Iorio & Belokurov ( 2021 ) are in good agreement. Ho we ver, ur retrograde selection (solid lines) imply that the maximum v r is eached closer to the Galactic centre and thus likely point at a slightly maller pericentre ( r < 3 kpc).\nMany of the chevrons detected are not symmetric with respect o the v r = 0 line. This is demonstrated in Fig. 6 where the red blue) curves mark the approximate locations of the L z > 0 ( L z < 0) hevrons as gauged by the signal in the v r < 0 portion of the phasepace. These model chevron tracks are symmetric with respect to the r = 0 line. Ho we ver, on inspection of the figure, it is clear that the ymmetry is broken in the data. The clearest example is the behaviour f the chevron 1 in the L z < 0 sample (right-hand panel) where it can e seen to turn around at v r \u2248 \u221250 km s \u22121 . Such behaviour is only ossible because chevrons are not orbits but are agglomerations of ebris with different energies. Similarly, there is no clear counterpart o chevron 1 at v r > 0 in the L z > 0 sample (left-hand panel). Also, he track for chevron 3 runs in between the two tentative detections t v r > 0. At L z < 0, the track for chevron 2 runs abo v e the strongest ignal at v r > 0.\nNRAS 518, 6200\u20136215 (2023)\nn this section, we study the dependence of the detected phase-space ubstructure on metallicity. Because only \u223c16 per cent of the Gaia R3 RVS sample have gspspec metallicities reported (based on he RVS spectra), we instead use the metallicities derived from the lue Photometer/Red Photometer (BP/RP) spectra. Unfortunately, he gspphot metallicities, provided as part of the Gaia DR3, show ignificant biases (see left-hand panel of Fig. 7 for a comparison ith the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment APOGEE) DR17 abundances). This is likely caused by the o v eresimation of the dust extinction for some stars, which in turn affects emperature and [Fe/H] measurements. To mitigate these biases, we e-derive the metallicities from BP/RP spectra, using a data-driven pproach calibrated to the APOGEE DR17 data (Abdurro\u2019uf et al. 022 ). Specifically, we cross-match a subset of the Gaia DR3 sample ith continuous mean-sampled BP/RP spectra ( \u223c220 million stars) ith the APOGEE DR17 measurements. We only use stars with ccurate enough BP/RP reconstructions, i.e. bp chi squared < .5 \u2217bp degrees of freedom and rp chi squared < 1.5 \u2217 p degrees of freedom , leaving approximately 546 000 stars. urthermore, we exclude stars with extinction E ( B \u2212 V ) > 0.2 from chlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis ( 1998 ), resulting in \u2248344 000 stars.\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\nV r\n[Fe/H]>-0.7\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\nV r\nLz>0 [Fe/H]<-0.7\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\nV r\nLz<0 [Fe/H]<-0.7\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\nV r\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200 400 V r\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 r\n-400\n-200\n0\n200\n400\nV r\nFigure 8.

In order to make he BP/RP coefficients independent from the brightness of stars, e divide each coefficient by the G-band flux of the star. To take nto account the dust extinction, we also apply a linear extinction orrection of the form X 0 = X \u2212 ( C 0 + C 1 X sub ) E ( B \u2212 V ), where 0 is the extinction corrected coefficient vector, X is the original -flux normalized BP/RP coef ficient coef ficient vector and X sub is a\nubset of 10 leading coefficients from BP and RP, and C 0 is a 110 lement extinction vector, while C 1 is the 110 \u00d7 10 extinction matrix. his extinction correction is only expected to be appropriate for mall extinction values E ( B \u2212 V ) 0.5 because at higher reddening alues extinction stops being linear in the coefficient space. We use efault parameters of the regressor and ignore the BP/RP coefficient ncertainties. The right-hand panel of the Fig. 7 shows the resulting Fe/H] values estimated with the RFR, plotted against the APOGEE easurements. Note that this shows the result of a cross-validation ith fivefolds, in other words, the comparison should not be affected y o v erfitting. The typical accurac y of the RFR (based on 16/84th ercentiles of the residuals) is \u223c0.1 dex for the sources with the agnitude distribution similar to the APOGEE sample. We note, o we ver, that the stars in the Gaia DR3 RVS are typically brighter han the APOGEE DR17 targets.\nWe use the spectrophotometric metallicities computed as disussed abo v e to split the low- | L z | sample into two parts: the in\nht tps://scikit -learn.org\nT ( s\nitu and the accreted halo. Note that with only [Fe/H] estimates n hand, it is not possible to obtain a pure accreted selection, as the n situ stars on halo-like orbits exists down to very low metallicities see Belokurov & Kravtsov 2022 ; Conroy et al. 2022 ; Myeong et al. 022 ). On the other hand, in the Solar neighbourhood, currently there s no strong evidence for GS/E members or any accreted stars with etallicities abo v e [Fe/H] =\u22120.7. Therefore, we use [Fe/H] =\u22120.7 s the boundary between the accreted and the in situ halo populations. ig. 8 shows the behaviour of the phase-space density for stars with Fe/H] > \u22120.7 ( in situ sample, left-hand panel) and [Fe/H] < \u22120.7 accreted sample, middle and right-hand panels). The range of ariation of the in situ radial velocities is lower compared to that f the accreted halo (i.e GS/E debris), in agreement with previous nalysis (Belokurov et al. 2020 ).

In summary, the galaxy formation odel includes homogeneous UV background radiation, gas cooling, tar formation, stellar evolution feedback, black-hole accretion, nd active galactic nucleus feedback.

Fattahi et al. ( 2019 ) created mock observations of the redshift = 0 stellar halos of the Milky Way analogs in the AURIGA suite. sing a Gaussian Mixture Model (see Belokurov et al. 2018 ), they dentified the AURIGA hosts whose stellar haloes (around the Solar adius) contained a highly elongated feature in the space of radial and zimuthal velocities. Requiring a high radial anisotropy and a high ractional contribution of the GS/E-like debris to the halo\u2019s stellar ass, Fattahi et al. ( 2019 ) selected a group of hosts whose stellar aloes at Solar radius best resembled the observed local stellar halo of he Milky Way. While approximately one-third of all AURIGA hosts atisfied loosely the abo v e conditions, four systems in particular, amely Au-5, Au-9, Au-10, and Au-18, stood out in terms of their igh radial anisotropy and the dominance of the GS/E-like debris. he stellar masses of the GS/E-like progenitor galaxy in these are etween 1 and 4 \u00d710 9 M and the accretion look-back times are\nNRAS 518, 6200\u20136215 (2023)\nThe parent box is the DMO counterpart of the largest box from the EAGLE roject (Schaye et al. 2015 ).\nd o r\netween 7 and 11 Gyr. Of these four, the GS/E merger in Au-5 s the most massive and therefore contains the largest number of tar particles, some three to four times more than the other three imulations. As the GS/E debris phase-mixes and thins out, the umber of particles in the simulation plays a crucial role in our bility to resolve the folds (see Beraldo e Silva, de Siqueira Pedra & alluri 2019b , for a detailed discussion of the role the sampling of he phase-space density plays in detecting the amount of mixedness). e therefore focus on Au-5, as it provides just enough of a particle esolution to study the survi v al of the phase-space chevrons of a S/E\u2019s numerical counterpart. Fig. 9 gives the ( v r , r ) phase-space density of the Au-5 halo with 00 \u00d7 50 pixels. Left to right, the columns show the logarithm of he stellar particle density, the column-normalized density and the ackground subtracted density. As abo v e, the background is obtained y simply convolving the density distribution with a Gaussian (in this ase with a FWHM = 7 pixels). The top row shows all of the halo articles, including both the accreted and the in situ components. hese are selected by requiring | L z | < 0.7 \u00d7 10 3 similar to the uts applied to the data in the previous section.

The distribution changes shape because in the inner Galaxy the density is dominated by the in situ halo.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/4/6200/6847223 by U niversity of D urham user on 11 M ay 2023\nnd the GS/E only particles. The column-normalized (backgroundubtracted) density is given in the top (bottom) row of the figure. he GS/E distribution contains a number of chevrons in the Solar eighbourhood, i.e at 5 < r (kpc) < 15 (bottom right). Note, ho we ver, hat when all halo particles are considered, the strength of some of hese is reduced (bottom left). This is partly due to the contribution of he in situ halo (bottom centre). While the orbits of the GS/E particles each as close as \u223c1 kpc from the Galactic centre, at these small alactocentric distances they are subdominant, being overwhelmed y the in situ halo (compare the left-hand and the right-hand panels n the top row of the figure). This is illustrated in Fig. 11 which erves as a companion to Fig. 5 and shows the overall shape of he ( v r , r ) phase-space as indicated by the percentiles of the radial elocity distribution in bins of radius. Similarly to Fig. 5 , the grey ines peak around r \u2248 5 kpc. Ho we ver, as clear from the behaviour f the coloured curves showing the v r ( r ) distribution trends for the S/E, this radius cannot be interpreted as the radius of the maximal mplitude of the GS/E radial velocity. In Au-5, the turnover in the ll-halo curves at r \u2248 5 kpc is driven by the in situ halo contribution. .2 Tailored merger simulations\nn order to have a greater control on the properties of the merger emnant, we ran a number of dedicated N -body simulations of ergers between a Milky Way-like host galaxy and a GS/E progenitor satellite). We broadly follow the simulation setup described in Naidu t al. ( 2021 ): the mass ratio between the host and the satellite is :2.5, its initial orbit is moderately eccentric (orbital circularity \u03b7\nL / L circ = 0.5), and the orbital angular momentum is tilted by 0 \u25e6 from the angular momentum of the host disc; ho we ver, unlike he Naidu et al. ( 2021 ) study, our satellite orbit is prograde. Both alaxies are initially set up in equilibrium, with (1 + 4) \u00d7 10 6\nMNRAS 518, 6200\u20136215 (2023)\nM\nFigure 12.

A detailed description and analysis of our imulation suite will be presented elsewhere, and here we focus on ne particular model, which qualitatively reproduces many of the bserved properties of the GS/E population, but does not necessarily atch the Milky Way in detail. In particular, the total mass and herefore the energy scale of the merger remnant are somewhat lower han in the fiducial Milky Way potential used in Section 3 . In this imulation, the satellite barely completes three pericentre passages\nNRAS 518, 6200\u20136215 (2023)\nefore being fully disrupted, and, as discussed in Naidu et al. ( 2021 ) nd Vasiliev et al. 2022 , the orbit of such a massive satellite quickly adializes, so that the final angular momentum of the debris is close o zero.\nFig. 12 shows a sequence of four snapshots at different times, tarting from the moment just after the disruption and ending roughly t the present day. We separate the stellar particles of the satellite nto three different stripping episodes, with the second one being he most dramatic, and within each episode, by their location in the\nl s l m f b o s e t w s t r c I f K t c c\na o s o i s \u03b8 p v p U t s a t o r w t t s i t c s e d m a s o\nb i T r e W s o\ni t d f p\nd r a S o v v l a b m o h\n6\nW i k o o s F a a 0 t e h\nl d a i ( t h p s s ( t t t d ( c A o i\nl R F m W\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/4/6200/6847223 by U niversity of D urham user on 11 M ay 2023\neading or trailing arms (based on the energy difference between the atellite centre and the particle at the moment of its unbinding). The east bound populations (in the first and the second trailing arms, agenta and green) have on average slightly positive L z , inheriting it rom the satellite\u2019s orbital angular momentum, and the more tightly ound debris are mostly located closer to L z = 0. Ho we ver, some f the stars from the first leading arm (cyan) occupy the region with uf ficiently negati ve L z to be associated with the Sequoia (Myeong t al. 2019 ) and Thamnos (Koppelman et al. 2019 ) populations in he Milky Way. Given that the satellite orbit was initially prograde .r.t. the host disc, it may appear surprising that the first to be tripped debris end up in the retrograde region. Ho we ver, we stress hat the host galaxy also mo v es significantly during this high-massatio merger, so the angular momentum w.r.t. the host centre is not onserv ed ev en for particles that are no longer bound to the satellite. t is therefore plausible that these retrograde populations may come rom the same progenitor galaxy as GS/E itself, as advocated by oppelman et al. ( 2020 ) and Amarante et al. ( 2022 ). In addition, he angular momentum of the host galaxy disc after the merger may ontinue to precess (Dillamore et al. 2022 ; Dodge et al. 2022 ), further omplicating the interpretation of the E \u2013L z distribution of the debris.\nParticles stripped in each episode have a wide range of energies nd orbital periods, leading to the phase mixing and winding up f indi vidual che vrons in the r \u2013v r phase-space and a corresponding tretching and flattening of ridges in the E \u2013\u03b8 r space (see section 2 f Dong-P \u0301aez et al. 2022 for an in-depth discussion). Each chevron n the r \u2013v r space corresponds to a continuous segment of particles tretching from \u03b8 r = 0 (pericentre) through \u03b8 r = \u03c0 (apocentre) to r = 2 \u03c0 (next pericentre). As the fourth column of Fig. 12 illustrates, articles belonging to the same chevron have a gradient of energy ersus \u03b8 r , with the less bound particles having longer radial orbital eriods and therefore moving slower to the right in the \u03b8 r direction. pon crossing the right boundary \u03b8 r = 2 \u03c0 , particles reappear on he left boundary and continue moving to the right with a constant peed, increasing the number of chevrons with time. Particles that rrive to their apocentres later have higher energies and therefore urn around at larger radii. This creates the prominent asymmetry f the outermost chevrons w.r.t. the sign of v r , with the maximum adius corresponding to positive v r and therefore moving outward ith time. Eventually, the gradients in the E \u2013\u03b8 r space decrease and he individual chevrons become more and more mono-energetic (note hat chevrons do not converge to the same energy, instead, the energy pread within a single chevron decreases with time), but the distance n energy or radius between them also decreases, making it difficult o separate out individual wraps. On the other hand, the \u2018superhevrons\u2019 (agglomerations of individual folds) corresponding to the ame stripping episode and arm (olive and green) remain discernible ven after 10 Gyr, and their spacing is primarily determined by the ifference in energy between the leading and the trailing arms of the ain (second) stripping episode, which itself encodes information bout the progenitor mass and structure. The apocentre radii of the uper-chevrons correspond to bumps and breaks in the density profile f the merger debris (Deason et al. 2018 ). We also note that the distribution of particles in energy space ecomes more wrinkled within a few Gyr after the merger, as shown n the third row of Fig. 12 (see also Jean-Baptiste et al. 2017 ). his is likely caused by global modes in a self-gravitating merger emnant, where particles satisfying particular resonance conditions nd up evolving in a similar way and reinforcing perturbations (e.g. einberg 1989 ). Ho we ver, these small-scale structures are e ventually moothed out and dissipate (fourth row), except perhaps in the utermost parts of the remnant. Fig. 13 shows that these wrinkles\nn the 1D distribution of particles in energy are present both in he accreted and in situ populations, and that the r \u2013v r phase-space istribution of the host stars also has at least one chevron-shaped eature created during the merger (corresponding to the Splash opulation in the Milky Way). Fig. 14 illustrates the spatial variations in the r \u2013v r phase-space istribution at different times. Shown are three spatial regions of adius 5 kpc, all centred at 8 kpc from origin, but at different zimuthal positions; of these, the first two are similar to the actual olar location relative to the GS/E population in the Milky Way (fig. 3 f Iorio & Belokurov 2019 ). At all times, the chevron configuration aries with the selected location and is different abo v e and below r = 0. Although the detailed structure of chevrons depends on the ocal spatial region, in general a few individual folds remain visible fter 10 Gyr, especially when coloured by L z . The variation in L z etween chevrons is inherited from the most dynamic stages of the erger, where both the host and the satellite mo v e relativ e to each ther, and debris stripped at different times and energies end up aving different values of L z after the dust settles.\nDI SCUSSI ON A N D C O N C L U S I O N S\ne have used Gaia DR3 RVS data to study small-scale substructure n the local portion of the tidal debris from the last significant merger, nown as GS/E. The Gaia DR3 RVS data set increases the number f stars with the complete 6D phase-space information by an order f magnitude compared to other currently available spectroscopic urv e ys, such as SDSS, RAVE, LAMOST, GALAH, or APOGEE. or e xample, applying selection criteria similar to those used in our nalysis (e.g. the quality of the astrometric distance measurement and ngular momentum) to APOGEE DR17 and LAMOST yields \u224810 00 and \u224830 000 halo stars in each of these respectively compared o \u2248260 000 analysed here. It is this ramp-up in the resolution that nables the study of the small-scale halo density variations reported ere. Armed with the Gaia DR3 RVS data, we are able to disco v er a arge number of previously undetected substructures in the density istribution of the local stellar halo (identified here with a simple ngular momentum selection), both in the phase-space and the ntegrals-of-motion space. In the energy and angular momentum E , L z ) space, the GS/E debris is revealed to have an elongated and ilted, a v ocado-like shape, where stars with higher energy tend to ave L z > 0. The largest number of stars are at low energies, in the it of the a v ocado. The E distrib ution is also rather wrinkly with ev eral o v erdensities and depletions, visible most clearly when halo tars with extreme [either prograde or retrograde) | L z | are considered see Section 3 and Fig. 1 )]. Similarly, in the ( v r , r ) phase-space, he local stellar halo density is not smooth. It shows a network of hin, nearly linear bands or chevrons that are o v erdense compared o the mean background. These chevrons show different strength epending on whether stars with L z > 0 or L z < 0 are considered Section 4 and Fig. 3 ). Part of the difference is due to the in situ halo ontamination, which is a strong function of the angular momentum. t least five distinct chevrons are recognizable in the v r < 0 portion f the phase-space; ho we ver, some of these may be further resolvable nto narrower components (Fig. 4 ).\nTo verify the in situ halo contribution, we estimate stellar metalicities by training a random forest regressor on the Gaia DR3 BP P spectra labelled using APOGEE DR17 abundances (Section 4.1 ). ig. 8 confirms that a large fraction of lo w-energy lo w- L z stars are etal-rich, with [Fe/H] > \u22120.7 and thus likely born in the Milky ay proper. The phase-space density of the in situ halo exhibits\nMNRAS 518, 6200\u20136215 (2023)\nM\nFigure 14.

Remaining columns show the r \u2013v r space in these regions, with particles coloured by their angular momentum L z . Although the evolution proceeds qualitatively in the same way across the entire galaxy, with individual chevrons winding up more tightly as time goes on, the difference between spatial regions can be quite significant.\nnloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/4/6200/6847223 by U niversity of D urham user on 11 M ay 2023\nNRAS 518, 6200\u20136215 (2023)\ns w a b G e ( t b a\nc a n o t m r w D f r n t a a i a m\no t d t r o t c c f t ( t o f f c\ns a p e s c i o r a t c f l\nt s a t l p n t o d p b b h o\nb e L t d p m h p r t s t p d d a M d \u2018\nt o s t a d T b o 6 h a a n c\nl b d i c a D a a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/4/6200/6847223 by U niversity of D urham user on 11 M ay 2023\neveral sharp changes, including a chevron-like feature o v erlapping ith chevron 1. The in situ halo contribution needs to be taken into ccount when estimating the pericentre of the GS/E debris: as judged y the retrograde members only it must be within r \u2248 3 kpc of the alactic centre (Fig. 5 ). The most prominent chevrons 1 and 2 have nergies similar to those of the main peaks of the energy distributions compare Figs 4 and 1 ). These strong o v erdensities ought to influence he stellar halo\u2019s radial density profile likely causing an additional reak around 10 < r (kpc) < 15, as proposed in Naidu et al. ( 2021 ) nd Han et al. ( 2022 ).\nAs far as the interpretation of the disco v ered halo substructures is oncerned, both the energy wrinkles and the phase-space chevrons re likely to be the consequence of phase-space mixing. In the Solar eighbourhood, i.e. away from both the pericentre and the apocentre, nly the quasi-linear portions of chevron are accessible and, indeed, his is how many of these structures appear in the Gaia data. Phaseixing is not supposed to alter the E distribution. Ho we ver, as a esult of the mixing, stellar energies end up correlating strongly ith the phase-space coordinates, i.e. stellar positions and velocities. ue to the ensued energy sorting, only stars with specific orbital requencies will be at the right phase to be observed in a small egion in the configuration space (e.g. a volume around the Solar eighbourhood) today. This would lead to a series of depletions in he energy distribution of the tidal debris, which, as a result, would ppear wrinkled. Similarly, even if due to phase-mixing the number nd the size of chevrons evolved to be such that at the present day ndi vidual che vrons are no longer discernible, limiting the sample to small region around the Sun would pick out a subset of chevrons, aking the phase-space more striated. The abo v e discussion describes the situation when a single clump f stars is deposited by the disrupting satellite into the host\u2019s potential o phase-mix. Realistically, ho we ver, e ven in the case of an explosive issolution of rapidly radializing satellite \u2013 such as that expected for he GS/E progenitor \u2013 multiple stripping episodes are predicted, each esulting in at least two clumps of stars with distinct energies (and ften L z ) corresponding to the leading and the trailing tidal debris. As he satellite sinks in the host\u2019s potential, the energy of each deposited lump will be different, thus making the final energy distribution lumpy (Section 5.2 ). This may lead to several complications in the uture analysis of the Gaia data. First, any modelling techniques hat rely on the assumption of a smooth stellar distribution function e.g. Leonard & Tremaine 1990 ) may struggle, given how wrinkly he observed DF is (see Grand et al. 2019 ). Furthermore, linking v erdensities in ( E , L z ) space with individual accretion events, ollowing ideas of e.g. Helmi & de Zeeuw ( 2000 ), may easily be raught with danger because a single event can produce multiple lumps.\nAs the satellite loses mass, the energy spread of the stripped tars diminishes, thus the energy distribution of the debris from sinking and disrupting dwarf galaxy should appear asymmetric, eaking at low E as observed here (see Section 3 ). Stars in each nergy o v erdensity left behind will phase-mix and create their own et of chevrons, which will evolve and merge, creating thicker superhevrons (see Section 5.2 ). It appears therefore that the complexity n the ( E , L z ) distribution of the GS/E tidal debris makes the use f the detected chevron patterns for the timing of the merger event ather difficult. None the less, the first comparison with both tailored nd cosmological zoom-in simulations are reassuring, as most of he salient features unco v ered in the Gaia data have numerical ounterparts in the models analysed. As demonstrated by an example rom the Auriga Cosmological zoom-in suite, phase-space chevrons eft behind by a merger similar to GS/E can remain detectable in\nhe host for many Gyrs (Section 5.1 ). Snapshots of our bespoke imulations show a clear prograde tilt of the ( E , L z ) cloud as well s the asymmetric, bottom-heavy energy distribution. Thanks to he high resolution of our tailored N -body simulation of a GS/Eike merger, new details of both the disruption and the relaxation rocesses emerge. F or e xample, the energy distribution gets wrinkled ot only due to the bursty stripping history but also because of he emergence of what appears to be global and rapid DM density scillations, \u2018sloshing\u2019 through the entire host soon after the satellite issolves. These ripples (Fig. 13 ) flatten out with time, and at the resent day, inhomogeneities in the energy distribution are dominated y the individual mass loss events and the leading-trailing energy imodality. The persistence of these feature o v er man y Gyr should elp trace and reconstruct the sinking of the GS/E progenitor as its rbit radialized. The simulated local Solar neighbourhood phase-space distribution ears many a resemblance to the Gaia DR3 RVS observations. For xample, the chevron pattern varies noticeable with both v r and z (Fig. 14 ). These L z -related variations are at least in part due to he complexity of the initial conditions with which the debris are eposited into the host. The differences in the chevron properties at ositive and negative v r are possibly due to either non-zero angular omentum of the stars considered and/or the asphericity of the ost potential. Both factors would ensure that once the stars have assed through the Solar neighbourhood, they are likely to miss this elatively small volume on the way back after the turn-around. Our ailored simulations convincingly demonstrate that the amount of mall-scale substructure in the phase-space does not only depend on he time since the beginning of the merger but also on the observer\u2019s osition inside the debris cloud. While many narrow chevrons are etectable even at 10 Gyr, the late-time phase-space density is ominated by super-chevrons. These phase-space folds observable s e.g. ( v r , r ) chevrons today are a powerful tool for constraining the W\u2019s gravitational potential similar to other phenomena that arise ue to long-term phase-mixing, such as stellar streams in the halo or snails\u2019 (phase spirals) in the disc.\nWhile both streams and chevrons are signatures of phase-mixing, here are important distinctions as to their phase-space morpholgy and therefore their detection and interpretation. Topologically, treams are tubes whose cross-section at any given location along the ube is small in the remaining five dimensions. Conversely, chevrons re cold, i.e. have small dispersion, only along the radial velocity imension (due to their high orbital eccentricity) or along energy. his lower dimensionality of streams means that they are detectable y a heliocentric observer with incomplete 6D information. The pposite is not true for phase-space folds or chevrons: complete D record is needed to reveal these. Differences in phase-space beaviour also mean that the established stream modelling techniques re not appropriate for chevron modelling. F or e xample, streams re often assumed to delineate orbits or a superpositions of a small umber of similar orbits \u2013 the assumption clearly not viable for hevrons.\nNote that phase-space folds have the advantage of co v ering a arger volume in the Galaxy compared to a typical stream. This can e exploited to map out the global properties of the Milky Way\u2019s mass istribution in a no v el and independent way. A demonstration of this dea is presented in Dey et al. ( 2022 ) who detect multiple phase-space hevrons in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy. Enjoying the wide nd dense spectroscopic co v erage pro vided by the recently launched ESI surv e y, the y show that the Andromeda\u2019s Giant Stellar Stream is part of a complex system of tidal debris from a massive and recent ccretion e vent.

( 2022 ) are ewer, more pronounced and are set further apart from each other in he phase space compared to the substructures disco v ered here. De y t al. ( 2022 ) take advantage of the panoramic view of the entire M31 alo and use the phase-space folds to constrain the M31\u2019s potential ut to > 100 kpc from its centre. Additionally, being as fragile as streams, the phase-space folds will lur and dissolve in reaction to time-varying potential perturbations see also Beraldo e Silva et al. 2019a , for a discussion of additional ffects that can lead to the dissolution of the phase-space substrucure). Interactions with a passing mass, such as a subhalo flying by or rotating bar, would alter the affected stars\u2019 orbital frequencies and hus destroy the coherence of the chevrons. Therefore, the continued xistence of these features implies a relatively quiet evolution of our alaxy since the GS/E merger, although further work is needed to ake more quantitative statements. We explore the response of the hase-space folds to satellites such as the Sgr dwarf in Davies et al. 2022 ).\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nhe authors are grateful to Kathryn Johnston, Nicol \u0301as Garavitoamargo, Emily Cunningham, Adrian Price-Whelan, David Spergel, ason Hunt, Giuliano Iorio, Leandro Beraldo e Silva, Jason Sanders, avid Hogg, Iulia Simion, Melissa Ness, Chervin Laporte, and he members of the Cambridge Streams and the CCA Dynamics roups for many illuminating discussions that helped to improve he quality of this work.
