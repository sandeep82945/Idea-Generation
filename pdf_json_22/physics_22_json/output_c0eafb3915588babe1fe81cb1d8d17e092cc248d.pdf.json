The arrival times of Stokes and anti-Stokes photons (scattered by the resonator\u2019s acoustic mode) are used to measure the resonator\u2019s phonon coherences up to the fourth order. By post-selecting on photon detection events, we also measure coherences in the resonator when \u2264 3 phonons have been added or subtracted. These measurements are found to be consistent with predictions that assume the acoustic mode to be in thermal equilibrium with a bath through a Markovian coupling.\nCavity optomechanical systems offer a platform for merging the advantageous features of the optical and the acoustic domains. In the last two decades, coherently coupled optical and acoustic resonators have been used to realize a range of quantum technologies including transducers, sensors, repeaters and memories. Quantum optomechanical devices can also be used in gravitational wave detection, tests of quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales, and searches for physics beyond the standard model [1\u20139].\nTo date, most quantum optomechanical devices have operated in a regime where linear equations of motion accurately describe the optical and mechanical modes, the coupling between them, the drives applied to them and the quantum backaction of their readout. A number of important results have been achieved in this linear regime, including the preparation of mechanical resonators in the ground state and squeezed states [10\u201313]. However, systems that exhibit nonlinearity at the single quantum level can provide access to states that offer advantages in quantum information processing, and which exhibit the most striking features of quantum mechanics, such as Wigner-function negativity, or violations of Bell-type inequalities [14\u201317].\nOne approach to attaining single-quantum nonlinearity is to use the measurement backaction of a single photon detector (SPD) [18, 19]. To date, this approach has been used in the domains of quantum optics, cavity-QED, and optomechanics [20\u201327]. In single-mode optomechanical systems, where acoustically scattered photons can be attributed to a single mechanical mode, the detection of a scattered photon heralds the creation (or annihilation) of a phonon in that mechanical mode. Such heralded protocols have been used to measure non-classical effects\nin mechanical resonators with mass \u223c 1 pg [28\u201331]. In devices with mass \u223c 1 ng, this approach has been used to measure simpler quantum effects (such as sideband asymmetry), and to verify the thermal character of the two-phonon correlations in the resonator [32].\nIn this work, single photon detection is used to probe and control (via post-selection) the mechanical state of a \u223c 1 ng oscillator comprised of superfluid 4He. The oscillator\u2019s phonon coherences are measured up to the fourth order, and are found to be consistent with the acoustic mode having a Markovian coupling to its bath. The phonon coherences of k-phonon-subtracted (and kphonon-added) thermal states are also measured for k \u2264 3. These results provide a detailed characterization of the acoustic mode\u2019s environment, and demonstrate that superfluid mechanical elements are well-suited for accessing nonlinear quantum optomechanical effects at the nanogram scale. Several factors contribute to these devices\u2019 performance, including their simple geometry, the unique material properties of superfluid 4He, and the wide applicability of SPD-induced backaction [33\u201335].\nFigure 1(a) shows a schematic of the device used here (also described in detail in Ref. [34]). Two single-mode optical fibers with high-reflectivity mirrors fabricated on their end faces are aligned using glass ferrules to form a Fabry-Perot optical cavity. The ferrules and fibers are epoxied to a copper housing that is thermally anchored to the mixing chamber (MC) of a dilution refrigerator at temperature TMC \u2248 20 mK, and the cavity is filled with superfluid 4He via a capillary line. The fiber mirrors set equivalent boundary conditions for the cavity\u2019s optical and acoustic modes (the latter are density waves in the 4He); as a result, these modes\u2019 spatial profiles are wellapproximated by a common set of orthogonal functions\n(the well-known Gaussian modes of paraxial cavities). Since the optomechanical coupling is set by the overlap of the superfluid density fluctuations with the optical intensity, the orthogonality of these modes\u2019 spatial profiles ensures an unusually clean realization of single-mode optomechanics: a given optical mode with wavelength \u03bbc (in 4He) couples only to the acoustic mode with wavelength \u03bbac = \u03bbc/2.\nWhen the optical mode is driven by a laser, the singlemode optomechanical interaction is described by the linearized Hamiltonian HOM = \u2212~g0 \u221a nc(a + a\n\u2020)(b + b\u2020), where a and b are the annihilation operators of the optical mode and of the acoustic mode respectively, nc is the mean photon number in the cavity, and g0 is the single photon optomechanical coupling rate [2].\nA schematic of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1(b,c). The optomechanical cavity has an optical resonance at \u03c9c/2\u03c0 = c/(nHe\u03bbc) (corresponding to a vacuum wavelength nHe\u03bbc = 1548.3(1) nm) and a linewidth \u03bac/2\u03c0 = 47.2(5) MHz, where nHe = 1.0261 is the refractive index of 4He. It is driven with a laser which is either reddetuned from \u03c9c by \u2206 \u223c \u2212\u03c9ac, or else blue-detuned by \u2206 \u223c +\u03c9ac, where \u03c9ac/2\u03c0 = \u03bdHe/\u03bbac is the acoustic mode frequency and \u03bdHe = 238 m/s is the speed of sound in\n4He. The red- (blue-) detuned drive effectively realizes a beamsplitter (two-mode squeezing) optomechanical interaction via cavity-enhanced anti-Stokes (Stokes) scattering [2]. Photons leaving the cavity (both the unshifted drive photons and the resonant anti-Stokes/Stokes photons) are then incident on two cavities which are arranged in series and have linewidths \u03baFC1/2\u03c0 = 1.71(2) MHz, \u03baFC2/2\u03c0 = 1.21(5) MHz. These cavities\u2019 resonances are locked to \u03c9c [36]. Since they meet the condition \u03b3ac \u03baFC1,2 (where the acoustic mode\u2019s linewidth \u03b3ac/2\u03c0 \u2248 3.5 kHz) they\nserve as filters by reflecting the drive photons while passing the anti-Stokes/Stokes photons to superconducting nanowire SPDs.\nFigure 1(d) shows a typical measurement of the photon detection rate as a function of \u2206. The peaks at \u2206/2\u03c0 = \u2213\u03c9ac/2\u03c0 = \u2213315.3(1) MHz correspond to the anti-Stokes (Stokes) sidebands of the acoustic mode. This frequency is consistent with the expected \u03c9ac = 315.40(2) MHz for the optical resonance employed (\u03bbac = \u03bbc/2 = 754.46(5) nm). The broad peak at \u2206/2\u03c0 = \u2213322.3(1) MHz is caused by guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering (GAWBS) of drive laser photons in the room temperature optical fibers [37]. A detuning-independent background is also evident. The solid lines in Fig. 1(d) are a fit to the sum of a constant (corresponding to the background counts), a broad Lorentzian (corresponding to the GAWBS signal), and the filter cavities\u2019 passband (a product of two Lorentzians, corresponding to the counts from the acoustic sidebands). A detailed description of this fit is given in Ref. [36].\nFits as in Fig. 1(d) yield the optomechanical scattering rates RAS(S) = \u03b3AS(S) \u00d7 \u03b7\u03ba \u00d7 \u03b7det, where \u03b3AS(S) is the anti-Stokes (Stokes) scattering rate for \u2206 = \u2212\u03c9ac (\u2206 = +\u03c9ac), \u03b7\u03ba = \u03bain/\u03bac is the cavity coupling efficiency, \u03bain is the cavity\u2019s coupling rate, and \u03b7det is the detection efficiency (set by the transmission of the filter cavities and the beam path, and by the SPD quantum efficiency). Standard quantum optomechanics theory predicts that \u03b3AS = \u03b3acCnac and \u03b3S = \u03b3acC(nac + 1), where \u03b3ac is the \u2018bare\u2019 acoustic damping rate, C = 4 g20\n\u03bac\u03b3ac nc is the multi-\nphoton cooperativity [2], and nac = \u3008b\u2020b\u3009. The difference between RAS \u221d nac and RS \u221d (nac + 1) is known as the quantum sideband asymmetry (QSA).\nAs shown in Ref. [36], measurements of RAS and RS\nindicate that the acoustic mode\u2019s temperature T \u2248 TMC when the incident laser power Pin . 300 nW. Measurements with Pin > 300 nW show the standard optomechanical damping effect, as well as heating (due to absorption of photons in the fibers and mirror coatings) that is consistent with a simple thermal model of the device.\nMeasurements of the mean photon flux (as in Fig. 1(d)) provide information that could also be obtained by heterodyne measurements of the acoustic sidebands [2]. However, much richer information is contained in the photon arrival times registered by the SPDs. This is because each detection of an anti-Stokes (Stokes) photon corresponds to the subtraction (addition) of a phonon in the acoustic mode. For example, the coherence of anti-Stokes photons g (n) AS = \u3008(a \u2020 AS) nanAS\u3009/\u3008a \u2020 ASaAS\u3009n is equal to the normally ordered phonon coherence g (n) ac \u2261 \u3008(b\u2020)nbn\u3009/\u3008b\u2020b\u3009n, while the coherence of Stokes photons g (n) S = \u3008(a \u2020 S) nanS\u3009/\u3008a \u2020 SaS\u3009n is equal to the anti-normally ordered phonon coherence h (n) ac \u2261 \u3008bn(b\u2020)n\u3009/\u3008bb\u2020\u3009n [36].\nHere aAS and aS are the annihilation operators for antiStokes and Stokes photons, respectively.\nMeasurements of these phonon coherences can be used to probe the acoustic oscillator\u2019s dynamics. For example, an oscillator in a thermal state should exhibit phonon bunching that decays on a time scale set by the oscillator\u2019s damping.\nIf the coupling to the bath is Markovian, then the nthorder coherence is predicted to be g (n) ac (\u03c4 ) = 1+fn(\u03b3\u0304ac\u03c4 ), where \u03c4 = (\u03c41, ..., \u03c4n\u22121), \u03c4k is the delay between the k th and (k + 1)th detected phonon, and the oscillator\u2019s total damping rate is \u03b3\u0304ac(Pin) = \u03b3ac + \u03b3opt(Pin), where \u03b3opt(Pin) is the contribution from optomechanical backaction [36]. The functions fn are straightforward to calculate, with f2(x) = e \u2212x and f3(x) = e \u2212x1+e\u2212x2+3e\u2212x1\u2212x2 (an expression for f4(x) is given in Ref. [36]). To measure the optical coherences (and thus the\nphonon coherences), a histogram of the delays between n photon arrival times C (n) AS(S)(\u03c4 ) is constructed and then normalized by its value at large delays. In the exper-\niment, the photon arrivals registered by the SPDs include the sideband photons as well as other events (such as background photons and dark counts, see Fig. 1(d)). These extraneous events are measured to be independent and identically distributed over time, so their contribution to C (n) AS(S)(\u03c4 ) can be calculated and corrected for [36]. The corrected histograms are fit to the form A+B\u00d7fn(\u03b3\u0304ac\u03c4 ), where A,B, and \u03b3\u0304ac are fit parameters. The best-fit value of A is used to normalize C\n(n) AS(S)(\u03c4 ) and\nconvert it to the corresponding phonon coherence (i.e., g (n) ac (\u03c4 ) = C (n) AS (\u03c4 )/A and h (n) ac (\u03c4 ) = C (n) S (\u03c4 )/A).\nFigure 2 shows the phonon coherences measured in this way (up to the fourth order) as a function of delay times, along with the corresponding fits. The zero-delay coherence values extracted from these fits are g (2) ac (0) = 1.980(2), h (2) ac (0) = 2.007(1), g (3) ac (0) = 5.843(7), h (3) ac (0) = 6.023(2), g (4) ac (0) = 23.01(3), and h (4) ac (0) = 23.98(1) (where the stated uncertainty corresponds to one standard deviation of the best-fit parameter). These values are consistent with the predictions for a thermal state: g (n) ac (0) = h (n) ac (0) = n!. (The fourthorder data and fits shown in Fig. 2(c) are for a finite delay bin of 5 \u00b5s < \u03c41 < 15 \u00b5s, and are thus expected to be less than 4! = 24 for (\u03c42, \u03c43) \u2192 (0, 0).) The \u03c4 -dependence of the coherences also agrees well with theory, as evidenced by the small residuals. This demonstrates that the acoustic mode is in equilibrium with the bath and that its energy fluctuations are consistent with a Gaussian distribution (to at least the fourth cumulant).\nFigure 3 shows various features of these fits for 0.9 \u00b5W < Pin < 6 \u00b5W (corresponding to 1 . nac . 10 [36]). The left panel shows that the zero-delay second- and thirdorder coherences are close to 2 and 6, respectively,for all Pin in this range. The right panel shows that the\ndecay rates \u03b3\u0304ac(Pin) extracted from fits (as in Fig. 2) exhibit the expected optomechanical backaction. A fit to standard optomechanics theory [2] (solid lines) gives g0/2\u03c0 = 4.70(5) kHz, consistent with the independent calibration described in Ref. [36].\nThe analysis described above (and shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) utilizes all the photons registered by the SPD. However, by post-selecting data that is recorded immediately after detection of one or more anti-Stokes (Stokes) photons, one can measure the properties of phonon-subtracted (phonon-added) states. For instance, g (2) ac (0) = 2 implies that the mean rate of photon arrivals doubles immediately after the detection of one anti-Stokes photon (or equivalently, the subtraction of a phonon). As the scattering rate \u03b3AS is proportional to the acoustic mode\u2019s mean phonon occupancy nac, one can conclude that nac doubles after the subtraction of a phonon. More generally, the evolution of the mean phonon occupancy n\u2212kac (\u03c4) (n +k ac (\u03c4)) of a k\u2212phonon subtracted (added) state can be measured through appropriate post-selection [36].\nMeasurements for k = 1, 2, 3 are shown in Fig. 4(a). If the equilibrium state (i.e., the state before the kphonon subtraction/addition event) is thermal, n\u2212kac (0) = (k + 1)nac, i.e. the mean occupancy increases (k + 1)- fold on the subtraction of k phonons, while n+kac (0) = (k + 1)nac + k. This seemingly counter intuitive form\nof the increase in nac can be understood as a Bayesian update to the thermal state. Viewed in the Fock basis, the detection of a scattered photon from a thermal state is more likely to occur from its high-n Fock components than from its small-n Fock components, and this biases the probability distribution toward high n [36]. As seen in Fig. 4(a), the phonon occupancy is indeed measured to double/triple/quadruple immediately after 1-/2-/3- phonon subtraction, and to subsequently decay back to equilibrium occupancy with the predicted time dependence (solid lines).\nSimilarly, we construct the various coherences of the heralded k-phonon subtracted (or added) thermal states through appropriate post-selection. The nth order coherences of such heralded states are determined by various slices in the higher-dimensional (n + k)-photon detection record. While this record viewed as a whole corresponds to that of a thermal state, the post-selection extracts the non-thermal heralded state coherences [36]. Fig. 4(b) shows the measured second-order coherence of a 1-phonon subtracted thermal state (normally ordered g (2) ac (\u03c4)|\u22121), and of a 1-phonon added thermal state (antinormally ordered h (2) ac (\u03c4)|+1), along with their theoretical expectations (solid lines). The measured zero-time second order coherences agree well with the theoretical expectation of 3/2, as does their decay to unity on the mechanical timescale.\nCoherences and other statistics of k-quanta - subtracted/-added thermal states are of interest in quantum metrology, quantum information and quantum thermodynamics. The optical equivalents of such states have been shown to be efficient at performing work and carrying information [38]. The ability to create and probe these states in an acoustic mode, as demonstrated here, extends the potential use of such states to optomechanical platforms [39\u201341].\nWe thank Radim Filip, Sebastian Garcia, Chitres Guria, Steve Girvin, Anna Kashkanova, Konstantin Ott, Andrey Rakhubovsky, and Alexey Shkarin for their help.
