    "abstractText": "The Covid-19 epidemic led to loss of the lives of many people in the world and had a very negative impact on the mental and physical health of humans. One of the effective ways to preventive strategies regarding is to study the impact of climatic parameters. This research introduces a new spatiotemporal methodology to explore the association between Covid-19 and hourly data of weather. This methodology developed based on machine learning using unsupervised clustering method. Six counties considered for finding association and the cities that have similar climatic temporal changes clustered and compared with cities that have similar number of Covid-19 cases. For this goal, a new model is developed for finding similarities between clusters, which indicates the association between weather and Covid-19. The result shows similarities are about 57% for wind speed, 63% for temperature, 63% for surface pressure, and 42% for elevation. Then result evaluated sing Kendall\u2019s tau_b and Spearman\u2019s rho which shows the proposed methodology has an acceptable result.",

Influenza, for example, is one of these diseases whose way of prevalence is seasonal and depends on air temperature in some parts of the world, although in the tropics, these changes are less [1]. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain these changes, but our understanding of this phenomenon remains insufficient [2]. Due to the viral nature of the disease, the corona spread is expected to follow a specific climatic pattern [3].\nCoronavirus is a family of viruses that can infect humans and animals [4]. The virus can cause a number of respiratory infections, such as acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [5]. Also, it discovered Coronavirus causes Covid-19 infectious\ndisease. The virus was unknown before people were infected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [1].\nFollowing the crisis of the coronavirus epidemic in different parts of the world, the coronavirus epidemic in Iran was officially confirmed on February 20, 2020. On March 24, 2020, the situation in Iran went from white to yellow. On March 29, Iran, which had only two cases last week, had confirmed 245 cases of coronary heart disease today. After that, Iran suffered from three coronary couriers across the country, and unfortunately, many people lost their lives [6]. Because of this rapid expansion research to find the factors have had the most significant impact on the prevalence of this disease are done.\nSo far, many mathematical models have been developed to discover the effect of climatic parameters such as humidity and temperature on virus transmission and this research has been the basis for motivating researchers to discover the impact of environmental factors on heart diseases [1]. In many of these researches climatic parameters considered as daily average, but their changes are hourly. It seems that these hourly changes have a great impact on people\u2019s daily behavior and also in number of cases. Therefore, this research seeks to examine climate change in more detail. To model these changes, science like machine learning is needed. * Abouzar Ramezani aramezani@sjau.ac.ir 1 Department of\u00a0Geomatics, Sayyed Jamaleddin Asadabadi University, Asadabad, Iran 2 Department of\u00a0Geography, Sayyed Jamaleddin Asadabadi University, Asadabad, Iran\n3 Department of\u00a0Geodesy and\u00a0Geomatics Engineering, K.N. Toosi University of\u00a0Technology, Tehran, Iran\n1 3\nThe state-of-the-art machine learning methods for outbreak relation with climatic patterns demonstrate a significant research gaps, for machine learning. This gap is an advancement in the time-series modeling of the outbreak. This paper contributes to improving time-series modeling of Covid-19 relation with weather parameters.\nFor this goal, this research focused on developing new spatiotemporal methodology for finding association between hourly data of weather parameters and Covid-19 outbreak. This methodology consists on spatiotemporal change in number of cases and climatic conditions. Previous researches show that such viruses follow climatic pattern. So for this reason in developed methodology, at first a time range is determined. Then, similar cities clustered based on each weather parameter and after that similar cities based on number of cases at same time are identified. For clustering same cities an unsupervised method implemented. For determining number of clusters the elbow method is used and for recognizing the influence of each climatic parameter a new model is developed. In this model a mathematical formula is developed that could be a basis for finding similarities range for spatiotemporal changes between two parameters."

            "text": "Meteorological parameters are among the crucial factors affecting infectious diseases. Many research with various methodologies have been done to find relationships between weather parameters and Covid-19 prevalence. These studies were done in different countries and used usual statistical method for finding relationship and most of them found temperature as an influential parameter which shown the climatic association with outbreak. For example, \u015eahin examines the correlation between weather and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) by considering nine cities in Turkey [7]. Spearman\u2019s method was used to analyze the results, which shows that wind speed and temperature are the most influential parameters. Also, a study aim to analyze the correlation between weather and Covid-19 pandemic in the capital city of Norway, Oslo [8]. The analysis results show that temperature and rainfall parameters are related to the rate of cases per day. However, maximum temperature has a positive relationship, and rainfall has a negative relationship.\nTosepu et\u00a0al. analyze the correlation between weather and Covid-19 pandemic in Jakarta, Indonesia [9]. The results show that the mean temperature has a positive relationship with the daily cases rate in Jakarta.\nA research in the provinces of Spain is done to explore the effect of daily temperature on the accumulated number of Covid-19 cases [10]. The results show that there is no\ncorrelation between the temperature parameter and the accumulated number of cases.\nAlso another research analyzed the association between Covid-19 and climate indicators in New York City, USA [11]. The climatic parameters were analyzed using Kendall and Spearman\u2019s method. The results show that there is an effective relationship between minimum temperature and air quality with the Covid-19 pandemic.\nNeuromas studies have been done in the field of Covid19 management using spatial analysis, which emphasis the capability of this discipline. Guan et\u00a0al. after studying the symptoms of Covid-19, realized that the disease had spread with different symptoms [12]. Lai et\u00a0al. Using graphs and maps, studied and recognized more of the symptoms of the disease worldwide [13]. Kuniya using his developed model forecasted the behavior of Coronavirus in Japan [14]. Alimadadi et\u00a0al. using machine learning analysis of genetic variants of mild, or severe Covid-19 patients classified and predicted people based on their vulnerability to potential Covid-19 infection [15]. Also a new ML method was proposed to classify patients into two groups, Covid-19 patients or non-Covid-19 people [16].\nCurrently, ongoing efforts have been made to develop novel diagnostic approaches using machine learning algorithms. For example, detecting Covid-19 infection using chest X-rays and CT scans, which provide accurate information for artificial intelligence [17].\nThe literature review shows the main problem in the previous research was finding association based on daily changes of climatic parameters using usual methods. Unlike previous research, a new methodology to find relationships between Covid-19 outbreak weather parameters is proposed. This issue has been examined in more detail and suggested a unique point of view to find the correlation between parameters. In this research hourly changes in weather conditions are studied and the Machine Learning method is implemented on weather\u2019s big data to find the primary correlation between clusters. The parameters which is considered in previous research also considered here but a time range and cities with different climatic conditions considered here. In this study unlike of previous researches the cities behavior together compared with their behavior in number of cases. A good science for finding this association is machine learning based method."

In this research, the number of cases has been considered and the number of deaths has not been studied.\n1 3\nThis study was conducted in 100 days at the time of registration of corona entry into the country between February 29, 2020, and June 10, 2020. Data on the incidence of coronary heart disease are received daily from the Provincial Medical Organization. The meteorological data source is the fifthgeneration atmospheric reanalysis dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5, https:// cds. clima te. coper nicus. eu/); meteorological data are analyzed hourly.\nIn this study, a new methodology has been proposed\nto find the relationship between weather parameters and Covid-19 outbreak. So, two analyses have been performed to discover the relationship between climatic parameters and Covid-19 outbreak. In the first analysis, changes related to Covid-19 outbreak among all 50 counties were examined and clustered. Then the same operation is performed for clustering counties based on the temperature, surface pressure and wind speed by analyzing big data in netCDF format. After that, for the second analysis, the similarity between clusters has been found based on a newly developed method.\nThe algorithm used in the present study is the K-means algorithm, which is one of the simplest machine learning algorithms without supervision. Using machine learning, hidden patterns in the data can be identified and used to predict future events [18]. In fact, machine learning uses statistical models to identify patterns and, by inferring the process of change, discovers hidden similarities [19]. Time series are data that are collected regularly at different times, and using machine learning, patterns that occur at consecutive times can be identified [20]. The K-Means algorithm, by carefully examining the behavior of the data set, identifies points that have similar behaviors over time and places each in a cluster.\nA cluster is a set of data points that fall into one category due to specific similarities. This means that the K-means algorithm detects k points at the center of the cluster so that each point is assigned to the nearest cluster [21].\nLet x1,x2,\u2026 ., xm \u2208 Rn be a finite number of patterns. To classify patterns into k cluster, 2 < k < m, the following equations is considered[21]:\nwhere\nWCSS is the sum of squares of the distances of each data point in all clusters to their respective centroids. A fundamental step for any unsupervised algorithm is determining the optimal number of clusters into which the data may be clustered. The Elbow Method is one of the most popular methods to determine this optimal value of k. The method consists of plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use[22].\nAfter clustering cities with similar hourly climatic conditions and cities with similar daily number of cases a model was developed to find similarity range. For describing that model, in the first step the parameters are symbolized.\n\u2022 Number of the basic parameters is \u201cone\u201d, that indicates the parameter with the \u201ci\u201d symbol, \u2022 Number of the considered parameters is \u201cm\u201d, that indicates the parameter with the \u201cj\u201d symbol, \u2022 Number of clusters in parameter i is \u201ct\u201d, that indicates cluster with the \u201cq\u201d symbol, \u2022 Nnumber of clusters in parameter j is \u201cn\u201d, that indicates cluster with the \u201cl\u201d symbol, \u2022 Number of members in the cluster \u201cl\u201d is \u201ck\u201d, that indicates cluster with the \u201cr\u201d symbol, \u2022 number of \u201ck\u201d subset is \u201cf\u201d, that has max repeat in the \u201cq\u201d,\nwhile\u00a0Sij is the similarity between parameters i, j.\n(1)P \u2236 minimizef (W, Z) = k \u2211\ni=1\nm \u2211\nj=1\nwijD ( xj, zi )\n(2)\nSubject to\nk \u2211\ni=1\nwij = 1, j = 1, 2,\u2026 ,m.\nwij = 0 or 1, i = 1, 2,\u2026 , k, j = 1, 2,\u2026 ,m\n(3)\nW = [ wij ] is a k \u00d7 m real matrix Z = [\nZ1, Z2,\u2026 , Zn ] \u2208 Rnk\nzi \u2208 R n is the center of cluster i, i = 1, 2,\u2026 , k D (\nxj, zi ) is some dissimilarity measure between xj and zi i = 1, 2, \u2026 , k, j = 1,\u2026 , m.\n(4) Sij =\n\u2211n\nl=1\n\ufffd\nf\nk\n\ufffd\nn\nn\n1 3"

The first law of Tobler could be seen in Fig.\u00a02b for temperature clustering. The first law of geography was developed by Waldo Tobler in 1970, and it observes that \u2018everything is usually related to all else, but those which are near to each other are more related when compared to those that are further away [23]. So, the counties which are near each other have same cluster and different clusters appeared in the Fig.\u00a02a for counties are far away.\nThe pattern of Fig.\u00a02c shows that the wind speed clustering could be interpreted based on the latitude and longitude of each county. This means those counties with\n1 3\nnear latitude and longitude have the same cluster except a few counties.\nIn the surface pressure clustering, there isn\u2019t any relation between counties with the same cluster (Fig.\u00a02d).\n4.3 Elevation classification\nAnother parameter which could be effective in virus outbreak is elevation. For this parameter, classification is used instead of clustering. Because there is no temporal data and counties could be classified based on their average of elevation. This classification sounds counties that have the same longitude have the same class (Fig.\u00a03). Although, little change could be seen in different longitude.\nReferring to the clustering map of temperature, pressure, wind speed and altitude, and comparing their spatial distribution pattern with COVID 19, the role of meteorological and altitude parameters is determined in the distribution pattern of this disease. The most similarity between clusters of COVID 19 and clusters of studied factors is related to temperature.\nAmong the three meteorological parameters, temperature, surface pressure, and wind speed, the strongest spatial pattern is related to temperature, while the surface pressure parameter has the weakest clustered spatial pattern. In other words, the trend of temperature changes in neighboring cities was more coordinated than the pressure in the study period."

After calculating similarity between effective parameters and daily number of cases, result is sowed in Table\u00a02.\nThe calculation shows that similarities between clusters are about 57% for wind speed, 63% for temperature, 63% for surface pressure and 42% for elevation.\nBased on results, the surface pressure and temperature clusters have more similarity with number of cases. This means, daily number of Covid-19 cases have more association with these two parameters. After those, wind speed with 57% similarity has most influence in Covid-19 outbreak. One limitation of this methodology is type of association with parameters. Reviewing researches were done in this field show, the relationship between temperature and surface\npressure with number of cases is negative. This means, by increasing the temperature and surface pressure in the same condition, the number of cases will be decreased. For wind speed this relationship is positive, so if wind speed increases, the number of daily cases will be increased. By\n1 3\ncomparing with previous research, this result is acceptable and in the following they will be evaluated with usual statistical method."

The non-parametric tests were used to investigate this relationship because the assumption of normality for the Covid-19 outbreak data could not be met. The relationship between climatic parameters and the total number of cases for each county have shown in Figs.\u00a04, 5 and 6. The results of Kendall\u2019s tau_b and Spearman\u2019s rho tests have indicated in Table\u00a03. Kendall\u2019s tau_b and Spearman\u2019s rho correlation coefficients between Covid-19 outbreak and pressure are equal to 0.220 and 0.314, respectively, and between Covid19 outbreak and wind speed are equal to 0.242 and 0.333, respectively, which both tests show a significant relationship at 99% confidence level. At the same time, this relationship is not substantial for temperature (Kendall\u2019s tau_b and Spearman\u2019s rho correlation coefficients are equal to 0.131 and 0.185, respectively), probably due to the effect of other important parameters. So the clustering method used in this study has been more successful in demonstrating the impact of this variable on Covid-19 outbreak. Because the counties have clustered based on the similarity of daily variability, in other words, both temporal and spatial dimensions are considered."

The methodology was developed based on clustering similar counties in hourly changes of climatic parameters. For clustering counties, K-means which is an\nunsupervised machine learning method was used. After clustering counties, a new model developed to calculate similarity between different parameters. The result shows, the similarity between clusters of Covid-19 outbreaks, Temperature, Surface Pressure, Wind speed are greater than 50% and only for elevation is 43%.\nOn the other hand, this results evaluated by statistical method and this method also confirmed similarity between clusters. So this methodology is a new solution for finding association between weather and Covid-19 using temporal data. By using this methodology, using climatic prediction model, authorities could forecast future situation of weather and made different plans for prevention of Covid19 outbreaks.\nFunding The authors declare that no funds, Grants, or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript.\nData availability The datasets generated during and analyzed during the current study are available in the Dropbox repository, https:// www. dropb ox. com/s/ eo143 j456l u7u17/ Data. rar? dl=0.\nDeclarations\nCompeting interest The authors have no relevant financial or nonfinancial interests to disclose."
