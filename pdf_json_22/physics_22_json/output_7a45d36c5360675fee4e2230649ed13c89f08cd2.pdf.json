To get a four-dimensional theory with Space-Time supersymmetry (which is necessary for phenomenological reasons), we must compactify the 6 of 10 dimensions on the Calabi-Yau manifold, as shown by Candelas et al. [1]. Another equivalent approach is the compactification of 6 dimensions into N = (2, 2) Superconformal field theory with the central charge c = 9, as shown by D. Gepner [2].\nAn important property of CY manifolds is the Mirror Symmetry, which reflects conjectured\nisomorphism of the \u03c3-models for each mirror pair of CY manifolds. This symmetry was predicted by D. Gepner [3], [4] and discovered in [5], [6], (see also [7]).\nIn paper [6] a construction was developed to show that partition functions of the orbifolds of\nFermat-type CY manifolds coincide for each mirror pair. Their idea was based on the observation that orbifold of Minimal model Mk over the group Zk+2 gives an equivalent, mirror reflected model. The more refined approach to the mirror symmetry was proposed by Borisov in [8]. The author constructed certain vertex algebra for a CY hypersurface in toric manifold, which was endowed with an N = 2 Virasoro superalgebra action and then proved that vertex algebra of mirror CY hypersurface is isomorphic to the original one. This paper was an important step towards rigorous construction of N = (2, 2) superconformal model of a CY manifold and proving the isomorphism for the models coming from mirror pairs of CY manifolds.\nIn this note, we consider orbifolds of CY hypersurfaces of Fermat-type given in projective\nvarieties and show explicitly that the corresponding N = (2, 2) superconformal models are isomorphic for each mirror pair of such orbifolds. This note can also be considered as a natural continuation of the papers [9],[10], where the explicit construction of states of orbifolds of Fermattype CYmanifolds was developed. There we have used the connection of CY orbifold models with the class of exactly solvable minimal N = (2, 2) superconformal models to explicitly construct a complete set of fields in the models using spectral flow transformation and the requirement of mutual locality of fields. Here we present an equivalent but mirror spectral flow construction of states and show that it is naturally connected to the mirror orbifold model. More precisely, we show that the N = (2, 2) superconformal model associated with a CY orbifold with an admissible group Gadm can also be treated as the N = (2, 2) superconformal model of a mirror\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nCY orbifold with the Berglund-Hubsch-Kravitz dual group G\u2217adm if we apply the mirror spectral flow construction of states instead of the original one.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the notations and briefly\ndiscuss the spectral flow construction of states in the Fermat-type CY orbifolds developed in [9], [10]. In Section 3 we introduce the mirror spectral flow construction of states of these orbifolds. Then we prove that this mirror spectral flow construction allows us to consider the original N = (2, 2) superconformal CY orbifold model with admissible group Gadm as a mirror CY orbifold constructed over the Berglund-Hubsh-Krawitz dual group G\u2217adm."

            "text": "Here, we briefly discuss the explicit construction of states in the Fermat-type CY orbifolds\ndeveloped in [9], [10].\nThe composite of N = (2, 2) Minimal Models. We consider \u03c3-models on the orbifolds of CY manifolds, which can be determined in the weighted projective space Pn1,...,n5 in terms of zeros of the quasi-homogeneous polynomials of Fermat type\nW (xi) :=\n5 \u2211\ni=1\nxki+2i , and W (\u03bb nixi) = \u03bb dW (xi), where d = \u2211\ni\nni. (2.1)\nAccording to Gepner [2], these kind of models are equivalent to the orbifolds of the composite models constructed from the tensor products\nM~k =\n5 \u220f\ni=1\nMki\n(2.2)\nof five N = (2, 2) superconformal minimal models Mki with the total central charge 9.\nA minimal superconformal model Mk with N = (2, 2) symmetry, is labeled by positive\ninteger k, which defines the central charge as\nc = 3k\nk + 2 .\n(2.3)\nThe commutation relations for the generators Ln, Jn, G \u00b1 r of N = 2 Super-Virasoro algebra\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nof symmetries of the model have the form\n[Ln, Lm] = (n\u2212m)Ln+m + c\n12 (n3 \u2212 n)\u03b4n+m,0,\n[Jn, Jm] = c\n3 n\u03b4n+m,0,\n[Ln, Jm] = \u2212mJn+m,\n{G+r , G \u2212 s } = Lr+s +\nr \u2212 s\n2 Jr+s +\nc 6 (r2 \u2212 1 4 )\u03b4r+s,0,\n[Ln, G \u00b1 r ] = (\nn 2 \u2212 r)G\u00b1r+n,\n[Jn, G \u00b1 r ] = \u00b1G \u00b1 r+n.\n(2.4)\nThe space of fields in NS and R sectors can be decomposed into the sum of products of\nminimal representations\nHNSl,q , H R l,q, l = 0, 1, ..., k, q = \u2212l,\u2212l + 2, ..., l. (2.5)\nThe conformal dimensions and charges of the corresponding primary states \u03a6NSl,q in NS sector are\n\u2206l,q = l(l + 2)\u2212 q2\n4(k + 2) , Ql,q =\nq\nk + 2 . (2.6)\nIn R sector the dimensions and charges of primary states \u03a6Rl,q are given by\n\u2206Rl,q = l(l + 2) \u2212 (q \u2212 1)2\n4(k + 2) +\n1 8 , Q\u0304Rl,q = Q R l,q = q \u2212 1 k + 2 + 1 2 . (2.7)\nIn general, the set of (quasi-) local fields of the minimal models have an A\u2212D\u2212E classification, but in this paper we consider only A series. Then the primary fields of the model are given by diagonal pairing of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic factors:\n\u03a8NSl,q (z, z\u0304) = \u03a6 NS l,q (z)\u03a6\u0304 NS l,q (z\u0304), (2.8)\n\u03a8Rl,q(z, z\u0304) = \u03a6 R l,q(z)\u03a6\u0304 R l,q(z\u0304), (2.9)\nwhere l = 0, ..., k, q = \u2212l,\u2212l + 2, ..., l. (2.10)\nand where the factors \u03a6NSl,q (z), \u03a6\u0304 NS l,q (z\u0304), \u03a6 R l,q(z), \u03a6\u0304 R l,q(z\u0304) are the primary states of the minimal representations (2.5) so that their conformal dimensions and U(1) charges are given by (2.6), (2.7).\nRecall that the chiral primary states [11] appear when q = l:\n\u03a6cl \u2261 \u03a6 NS l,l , (2.11)\nwhile the anti-chiral primary states [11] appear when q = \u2212l:\n\u03a6al \u2261 \u03a6 NS l,\u2212l. (2.12)\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nThe conformal symmetry of the composite model M~k is the Virasoro N = (2, 2) superalge-\nbra, defined as the diagonal subalgebra in the tensor product of 5 minimal models as follows\nLtot,n = \u2211\ni\nL(i),n, Jtot,n = \u2211\ni\nJ(i),n, G \u00b1 tot,r =\n\u2211\ni\nG\u00b1(i),r. (2.13)\nThe action of this algebra is correctly defined only on the product of NS representations\nor on the product of R representations of minimal models Mki . Therefore, we can form NS or R primary fields in the product model M~k by taking only products of primary fields from each minimal model Mki belonging to the same (NS or R) sectors:\n\u03a8NS~l,~q (z, z\u0304) =\n\u220f\ni \u03a8 NS li,qi (z, z\u0304), (2.14)\n\u03a8R~l,~q (z, z\u0304) =\n\u220f\ni\u03a8 R li,qi (z, z\u0304). (2.15)\nThe descendant fields are generated from these primary fields by the creation generators of\nthe N = 2 Virasoro superalgebras of the Mki models.\nThe admissible group. To define the admissible group [12], [13] giving the orbifold model we recall that the composition of the Mki models has a discrete symmetry group which is defined as follows\nGtot = 5 \u220f\ni=1\nZki+2 = { 5 \u220f\ni=1\ng\u0302wii , wi \u2208 Z, g\u0302i = exp (\u01312\u03c0J(i),0)}. (2.16)\nThe admissible group is a subgroup of Gtot which is defined as follows:\nGadm = { ~w = \u2211K\u22121 a=0 ma ~\u03b2a, ma \u2208 Z, \u2211 i \u03b2ai ki+2 \u2208 Z, \u03b2ai \u2208 Z} \u2282 Gtot,\n~\u03b20 \u2261 (1, 1, 1, ..., 1) \u2208 Gadm. (2.17)\nThus, the 5-dimensional vectors ~\u03b2a are the generators of the admissible group, so that an arbitrary element ~w \u2208 Gadm can be decomposed in terms of these generators. The admissible group is defined in such a way to preserve a nowhere-vanishing holomorphic (3, 0)-form on the CY hypersurface.\nSpectral flow construction of states in N = (2, 2) Minimal Model. In [10] (see also [9]), the spectral flow have been used to construct the orbifold model primary fields. Here we recall this construction.\nThe spectral flow [14] is given by the one-parametric family of automorphisms\nG\u0303\u00b1r = U \u2212tG\u00b1r U t = G\u00b1r\u00b1t, (2.18)\nJ\u0303n = U \u2212tJnU t = Jn + c 3t\u03b4n,0, (2.19)\nL\u0303n = U \u2212tLnU t = Ln + tJn + c 6 t 2\u03b4n,0, t \u2208 1 2 + Z (2.20)\nof the N = 2 Virasoro superalgebra.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nFor the minimal model Mk spectral flow can be used to construct all primary fields [15].\nIndeed, the state\nVl,t = (UG \u2212\n\u2212 1 2\n)t\u03a6cl , 0 \u2264 t \u2264 l. (2.21)\ngives spectral flow realization of the primary state \u03a6NSl,q , where q = l \u2212 2t. For the purposes of the orbifold construction we need to extend this formula. Namely, we define the state\nVl,t = (UG \u2212\n\u2212 1 2\n)t\u2212l\u22121U(UG\u2212 \u2212 1\n2\n)l\u03a6cl , l + 1 \u2264 t \u2264 k + 1. (2.22)\nIt can be checked that the state Vl,t gives the spectral flow realization of the primary state \u03a6 NS\nl\u0303,q\u0303 ,\nwhere l\u0303 = k \u2212 l, q\u0303 = k + 2 + l \u2212 2t.\nNotice the spectral flow the periodicity property [15], (see also [16])\nUk+2 \u2248 1. (2.23)\nIn what follows we will use the notation Vl,t instead of \u03a6 NS l,q to emphasize that we are dealing with the spectral flow realization (2.21), (2.22) of primary states of Minimal model.\nThe spectral flow construction of the primary states in the R-sector can be obtained by\napplying the operator U 1 2 to the expressions (2.21), (2.22).\nIt is helpful now to refine the formulas (2.21), (2.22) to see when the spectral flow construc-\ntion gives the chiral or anti-chiral primary states of minimal model. We have\nt = 0 : Vl,0(z) = \u03a6 c l (z) is a chiral primary,\nt = l : Vl,l(z) = (UG \u2212\n\u2212 1 2\n)l\u03a6cl (z) \u2248 \u03a6 a l (z) is an anti-chiral primary,\nt = l + 1 : Vl,l+1(z) = U(UG \u2212\n\u2212 1 2\n)l\u03a6cl (z) \u2248 \u03a6 c l\u0303 (z), l\u0303 = k \u2212 l, is a chiral primary,\nt = k + 1 : Vl,k\u2212l(z) = (UG \u2212\n\u2212 1 2\n)k\u2212lU(UG\u2212 \u2212 1\n2\n)l\u03a6cl (z) \u2248 \u03a6 a l\u0303 (z), l\u0303 = k \u2212 l, is an anti-chiral primary.\n(2.24)\nHere it is worth noting that, obviously, instead of (2.21), (2.22) we could propose a con-\nstruction that begins with antichiral primary fields. This mirror construction will be the key point of discussion in the next section.\nSpectral flow construction of states in the orbifold model. The spectral flow realizations (2.21),(2.22) are very convenient to build the primary fields in the orbifold model. The construction is given in three steps.\nIn the first step, we use the elements ~w of the admissible group (2.17) for expanding the\nstate space of the product model M~k by adding in NS sector the twisted fields of the form\n\u03a8NS~l,~t, ~w(z, z\u0304) = V~l,~t+~w(z)V\u0304~l,~t(z\u0304), (2.25)\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nwhere\nV\u0304~l,~t(z\u0304) = \u220f\ni\nV\u0304li,ti(z\u0304), V\u0304li,ti(z) = (UG \u2212\n\u2212 1 2\n)tii \u03a6\u0304 c li (z), 0 \u2264 ti \u2264 li, (2.26)\nand\nV~l,~t+~w(z) =\n5 \u220f\ni=1\nVli,ti+wi(z), (2.27)\nwhere\nVli,ti+wi(z) =\n    \n   \n(UG\u2212 \u2212 1\n2\n)ti+wii \u03a6 c li (z), if 0 \u2264 ti +wi \u2264 li,\n(UG\u2212 \u2212 1\n2\n)ti+wi\u2212li\u22121i Ui(UG \u2212\n\u2212 1 2\n)lii \u03a6 c li (z), if li + 1 \u2264 ti + wi \u2264 ki + 1.\n(2.28)\nIn the second step, we require the mutual locality of the fields obtained above. It gives the\nequations\n\u2211\ni\n\u03b2ai(qi \u2212wi)\nki + 2 \u2208 Z, a = 0, ...,K \u2212 1. (2.29)\nThus, the field \u03a8NS~l,~t, ~w (z, z\u0304) will be mutually local with all other fields in NS sector if (2.29) is fulfilled. In other words, this system of equations singles out the admissible (~l,~t) (or (~l, ~q)) of NS primary fields \u03a8NS~l,~t, ~w (z, z\u0304) which appear in the twisted sector ~w of the orbifold model.\nThe third step of the construction is simple: we generate R sector fields as\n\u03a8R~l,~t, ~w(z, z\u0304) = \u220f\ni\nU 1 2 i U\u0304 1 2 i \u03a8 NS ~l,~t, ~w (z, z\u0304). (2.30)\nThese fields together with the mutually local NS fields constructed before can be considered\nas a set of primary fields of the orbifolds in the sense that all the other fields of the orbifold are generated by applying to them the creation operators of the N = (2, 2) Virasoro superalgebras of Mki models.\nIt is clear that NS sector fields of the orbifold are mutually local (by construction), while\nR sector fields are mutually quasi-local among themselves and with NS sector fields. In other words, the quasi-locality structure of the orbifold is the same as for any N = (1, 1) superconformal model.\nThe orbifold model satisfy all the requirements of Conformal Bootstrap, as shown in [10]. In\nparticular, the OPE is closed on the set of NS sector fields restricted by the locality equations (2.29) and this entails the OPE closure of the total set of orbifold model fields.\nThe chiral rings states. In this paragraph we recall the construction of chiral-chiral and anti-chiral-chiral states using the general expressions (2.25)-(2.28).\nIn order to get (c, c) primary field in orbifold model one must have (c, c) primary field in\n\u2013 6 \u2013\neach Mki factor of the composite model M~k. Therefore, according to the general formula (2.25) we can see that in the anti-holomorphic sector the chiral primary state is given by the first line in (2.24) in each factor Mki , while in the holomorphic sector the chiral primary state is given by the first line or by the third line in (2.24). It gives the\nAlgorithm for finding (c, c) fields in the twisted ~w sector. 1. For each N = 0, 1, 2, 3 to find all the vectors ~l = (l1, ..., l5) satisfying the equations\n\u2211\ni\nli ki + 2 = N, \u2211\ni\n\u03b2ai li \u2212 wi ki + 2 \u2208 Z, a = 0, ...,K \u2212 1. (2.31)\n2. Among the found vectors ~l, we leave only those for which the set of numbers wi satisfies the following relations\nwi = 0 mod ki + 2, or wi = li + 1 mod ki + 2. (2.32)\nSimilarly, one can obtain the algorithm of finding (a, c) primaries in the orbifold. In this case\none should take (a, c) primary field in each factor Mki of the composite model M~k. Therefore, in the anti-holomorphic sector the chiral primary state is given again by the first line from (2.24) in each factor Mki , while in the holomorphic sector anti-chiral primary state is given by the second line or by the fourth line from (2.24). Hence, taking into account (2.25)-(2.28) we obtain the\nAlgorithm for finding (a, c) fields in the twisted ~w sector. 1. For each N = 0, ..., 3 find out all the vectors ~l = (l1, ..., l5) satisfying the equations\n\u2211\ni\nli ki + 2 = N, \u2211\ni\n\u03b2ai li \u2212 wi ki + 2 \u2208 Z, a = 0, ...,K \u2212 1.

            "text": "In this section we move on to the main point of the paper. We present mirror spectral\nflow construction, which together with mutual locality requirement leads to the mirror orbifold model.\nConsider first the mirror version of formulas (2.21), (2.22), which starts with the anti-chiral\nstate:\nVl,t = (U \u22121G+\n\u2212 1 2\n)l\u2212t\u03a6al , 0 \u2264 t \u2264 l, (3.1)\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nVl,t = (U \u22121G+\n\u2212 1 2\n)k+1\u2212tU\u22121(U\u22121G+ \u2212 1\n2\n)l\u03a6al , l + 1 \u2264 t \u2264 k + 1. (3.2)\nTheir validity is coming from the analysis of singular vectors in the minimal N = 2 Virasoro superalgebra representations [15]. Another way to get these expressions is to invert the expressions from the second and fourth lines of (2.24).\nThe mirror spectral flow construction of fields in the orbifold model starts with anti-chiral\nprimary state in holomorphic factor of (2.25) and uses (3.1), (3.2), while the anti-holomorphic factor remains intact. Thus, for the anti-holomorphic factor of \u03a8NS~l,~t, ~w (z, z\u0304) we still have the expression (2.26), while for the holomorphic factor we apply (3.1) or (3.2) to get:\nV~l,~t+~w(z) = 5 \u220f\ni=1\nVli,ti+wi(z),\nVli,ti+wi(z) =\n    \n   \n(U\u22121G+ \u2212 1\n2\n)li\u2212ti\u2212wii \u03a6 a li (z), if 0 \u2264 ti + wi \u2264 li,\n(U\u22121G+ \u2212 1\n2\n)ki+1\u2212ti\u2212wii U \u22121 i (U \u22121G+ \u2212 1\n2\n)lii \u03a6 a li (z), if li + 1 \u2264 ti +wi \u2264 ki + 1.\nMaking the involution\nG\u00b1(z) \u2192 G\u2213(z), J(z) \u2192 \u2212J(z), U(z) \u2192 U\u22121(z), T (z) \u2192 T (z). (3.3)\nwe transform the expressions above back into the old form but with different twists\nV~l,~t+~w\u2217(z) =\n5 \u220f\ni=1\nVli,ti+w\u2217i (z), (3.4)\nwhere\nVli,ti+w\u2217i (z) =\n    \n   \n(UG\u2212 \u2212 1\n2\n) ti+w\u2217i i \u03a6 c li (z), w\u2217i = li \u2212 2ti \u2212 wi,\n(UG\u2212 \u2212 1\n2\n) ti+w\u2217i \u2212li\u22121 i Ui(UG \u2212\n\u2212 1 2\n)lii \u03a6 c li (z), w\u2217i = ki + 2 + li \u2212 2ti \u2212 wi \u2248 li \u2212 2ti \u2212 wi\n(3.5)\n(note that w\u2217i is mod ki+2 defined). Recovering the anti-holomorphic factors we obtain another representation for the NS sector fields of the orbifold model:\n\u03a8NS~l,~t, ~w\u2217(z, z\u0304) = V~l,~t+~w\u2217(z)V\u0304~l,~t(z\u0304). (3.6)\nThe R sector primary fields now take the form\n\u03a8R~l,~t, ~w\u2217(z, z\u0304) = \u220f\ni\nU \u2212 1 2 i U\u0304 1 2 i \u03a8 NS ~l,~t, ~w\u2217 (z, z\u0304). (3.7)\nThus, the mirror spectral flow construction (together with the involution (3.3)) gives another representation for the fields of the orbifold model, where the twisted sectors are numbered by\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nanother set of twist vectors w\u2217. In other words, the mirror spectral flow construction looks like the orbifold of M~k which is made by using another group. More precisely, we have the following\nProposition.\nFor each N = (2, 2) superconformal orbifold model M~k/Gadm, the mirror spectral flow\nconstruction (3.4)-(3.6) defines new admissible group G\u2217adm and N = (2, 2) superconformal orbifold model M~k/G \u2217 adm such that:\n1. the group G\u2217adm is Berglund-Hubsh-Krawitz dual to Gadm; 2. the model M~k/G \u2217 adm is isomorphic to the model M~k/Gadm; 3. (c, c) ring ((a, c) ring) of M~k/G \u2217 adm coincides with (a, c) ring ((c, c) ring) of M~k/Gadm.\nProof.\n1,2. For an arbitrary vector ~w\u2217 and arbitrary ~w \u2208 Gadm we have from (3.5)\n\u2211\ni\nwiw \u2217 i ki + 2 =\n   \n  \n\u2211 a w a \u2211 i \u03b2ai(li\u22122ti\u2212wi) ki+2 , if w\u2217i = li \u2212 2ti \u2212 wi,\n\u2211 a w a \u2211 i \u03b2ai(ki+2+li\u22122ti\u2212wi) ki+2 , if w\u2217i = ki + 2 + li \u2212 2ti \u2212 wi.\n(3.8)\nThus, taking into account (2.29) we obtain another form of mutual locality equations for the original orbifold M~k/Gadm:\n\u2211\ni\nwiw \u2217 i ki + 2 \u2208 Z, ~w \u2208 Gadm. (3.9)\nAs a particular case of (3.9) we obtain\n\u2211\ni\nw\u2217i ki + 2 \u2208 Z. (3.10)\nThis equation means that the new twisted vectors ~w\u2217 = ~l \u2212 2~t \u2212 ~w satisfy admissible group equations (2.17). Moreover, the vector (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) arises among ~w\u2217. Indeed, if ~l = ~t = 0, w = (k1 + 1, ..., k5 + 1), the twist vector ~w \u2217 = \u2212~w = \u2212(k1 + 1, ..., k5 + 1) \u2248 (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) and the corresponding state fulfills mutual locality equations (2.29)\n\u2211\ni\n\u03b2ai \u2212ki \u2212 1\nki + 2 =\n\u2211\ni\n\u03b2ai(\u22121 + 1\nki + 2 ) \u2208 Z\n(3.11)\n(where the admissible group equation for ~\u03b2a has been used.)\nIt is easy to see that the new twists form an abelian group because for any pair ~w\u22171 and ~w \u2217 2,\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nthe vector ~w\u22171 + ~w \u2217 2 arises among the set of ~w \u2217. It indeed follows because\n~w\u22171,2 = ~l1,2 \u2212 2~t1,2 \u2212 ~w1,2 = ~q1,2 \u2212 ~w1,2,\n(3.12)\nbut ~q is conserved while ~w is additive when we consider the OPE of the corresponding fields. Hence, the twists ~w\u2217 are additive w.r.t. the OPE (in other words, the mutual locality conditions (2.29) are consistent with the OPE). Thus, we have shown that the set of new twists ~w\u2217, arising in (3.5) form an admissible group, which we denote as G\u2217adm. Hence, the mirror spectral flow construction (3.6), (3.3) defines new orbifold model M~k/G \u2217 adm, because (3.9) can also be considered as mutual locality equations for this new model. By the construction, this new N = (2, 2) superconformal model is isomorphic to the original one.\nThe group G\u2217adm is obviously the maximal dual group to Gadm. Finally note that mutual locality equations (3.9) are nothing else but the definition of dual\ngroup of Berglund, Hubsh and Krawitz [13].\n3. Let us show that equations from (c, c) algorithm for dual orbifold model M~k/G \u2217 adm are\nequivalent to the equations from (a, c) algorithm for the original model.\nBecause of ti must be zero for the (c, c) field of the dual model, the conditions (2.32) for the\ndual twists take the form\nw\u2217i = 0 \u21d4 wi = li,\nor li + 1 = w \u2217 i \u21d4 wi = ki + 1. (3.13)\nwhere we have used expressions for w\u2217i from (3.5). Thus, (c, c) equations for the dual model are nothing else but (a, c) equations (2.34) for the original orbifold.\nLet us now consider (a, c) algorithm equations for the dual model. Again, ti = 0 so that\n(2.34) equations for the dual twists take the form\nw\u2217i = li \u21d4 wi = 0,\nor w\u2217i = ki + 1 \u21d4 wi = li + 1, (3.14)\nwhere we have used again the expressins for w\u2217i from (3.5) and have taken into account that wi is mod ki+2 defined. Hence, (a, c) equations for dual model are nothing else but (c, c) equations (2.32) for the original orbifold. It finishes the proof of Proposition.\nTheProposition thus gives the explicit construction of mirror pair of CY orbifolds (M~k/Gadm,\nM~k/G \u2217 adm), which correspond to the same N = (2, 2) superconformal model. Moreover, the expressions (2.25)-(2.28) and (3.4)-(3.6) provide the explicit mapping between the states of this pair, such that (c, c) ((a, c)) ring ofM~k/Gadm orbifold is mapped to (a, c) ((c, c)) ring ofM~k/G \u2217 adm orbifold.\nWhile the spectral flow construction and its mirror have been based only at one point in\nthe respective moduli space (namely, the point which has an interpretation as an orbifold of composite minimal models), the result necessarily extends to all other nearest points of moduli space.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nNotice also that the spectral flow construction of mirror pairs is not limited to the product\nof 5 models and can be extended for the composite models of a more general type.\nThe spectral flow construction of mirror pairs of orbifolds is very close to the algorithm which\nwas discussed in [6]. Indeed, it is easy to see that the additional Zki+2 orbifolding for each Mki (see [6]) is equivalent to application of mirror spectral flow construction, instead of the original spectral flow construction from section 2. Although the mirror spectral flow construction can be viewed as the result of Zki+2 orbifoldings, we prefer not to do all these intermediate steps, because, in our opinion, the mirror spectral flow construction looks more clear and natural in the context of the approach advocated in [10], [9]. Besides, the orbifolding from [6] does not work directly for non Fermat-type polynomials [12], while the construction of mirror pairs discussed above, is, as we hope, more general."
