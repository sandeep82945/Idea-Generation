Where hospital treatment concerns a dental problem or complaint, I would argue that it is a requisite for optimal care. Those in general dental practice routinely deal with patients presenting in pain; getting these patients out of pain is, I am sure most GDPs would agree, one of the most rewarding parts of working in primary care. Medical factors greatly affect the ease of getting patients out of dental pain, whether this is through extraction, extirpation, or otherwise. As a foundation dentist working in an area with a large elderly population, I usually have to rely on recollections of hospital treatment, and similarly encounter challenges in ascertaining what treatment was provided and the details of any medications given. The staggering advances of medicine mean many patients present alone with multiple morbidities and polypharmacy. It is unfair to shift responsibility to accurate patient anamnesis. Patients often forget to mention medications that are not taken daily, which also may not be present on \u2018repeat prescriptions\u2019, and some just do not see the relevance of disclosing all their medications. This is not to mention the more difficult barriers such as early-stage dementia. Delaying treatment to get accurate records from general practitioners is time-consuming and cumbersome. Dr Rennie also mentions the medical information available in hospital settings; GDPs\u2019 access to past medical history, treatments and medications would greatly facilitate in providing timely and safe care to these patients. I have encountered patients of private care homes who present with medical summaries, including current medications and past hospital treatment. This information greatly assists in being able to treat toothache at the time of presentation, and this abridged version of medical information may provide an intermediate solution, before integration of those systems available in hospitals becomes prevalent in primary care dentistry. Could patients routinely be given a summary to take with them to primary care appointments? The rollout of NHS emails to dentists may provide a way to communicate this information automatically and securely to those delivering NHS care. Given the ageing population, and strives of medicine, this is not an issue that will get better on its own. I hope those with less naivety regarding implementing such change can see the importance of a need for improved communication between doctors and dentists. J. Jandu, Sidmouth, UK",

            "text": "Sir, the question of why dental problems present to hospital doctors and GPs has always been a problem.1 I do not know what information is given to doctors during training about the dental services.\nThere seem to be two areas that Dr Rennie raises: 1. Why do dental problems come to\nemergency departments? 2. Who should be informed on discharge?\nFirst of all, patients are not registered with an NHS dentist but are only patients of NHS dental providers during a course of treatment. Between courses, they are not his/her patients with any duty of care, or automatic right to be seen by that provider\u2019s practice. The registration of dental patients was removed by the Department of Health when the current contract was introduced in 2006. Many patients have a \u2018regular\u2019 NHS dentist but this is not the same as being registered.\nThe other factor which is different to medical patients\u2019 problems is that many dental patients must pay for their treatment under the NHS. If the medical Emergency Clinic sees and treats them, then it is free. There is also the factor that some patients are fearful of dentistry which they believe may be painful whereas seeing the doctor is more likely to involve medication and no physical treatment. So these factors may be the cause of dental problems presenting.\nOn discharge, those patients with a regular dentist should be given a discharge"

            "text": "Sir, I am writing to highlight the high incidence of dental caries amongst performers of the musical theatre industry. This has been noted at one dental practice where multiple actors and vocalists attended their general dental practitioner for routine \u2018check-ups\u2019 over a period of time. It was noted many of the performers had developed buccal caries on upper first and second molars. Following a detailed history and diet analysis, all the actors disclosed the regular consumption of high-sugar menthol-based pastilles. The actors stated that they regularly perform on stage holding a menthol sweet in the upper buccal sulci. This practice would be repeatedly carried out during a performance which can typically last up to four hours in duration.\nThe use of menthol as a cold receptor agonist to improve upper airway patency has been documented in the literature. However, there is no strong evidence to suggest improvement of upper airway congestion and airflow.1 It could be stated that use of the menthol pastilles is nothing more than a placebo with a high psychological effect. Actors stated that it helped their confidence to \u2018hit the high notes\u2019.\nMany also affirmed that due to the physiologically demanding nature of performing, regular consumption of energy drinks and sweet snacks is a part of a typical diet. With this routine consumption of fermentable carbohydrates in both solid and liquid form, it lowers the intraoral pH below the critical level of 5.5 where demineralisation of enamel occurs.2 This\n354 BRITISH DENTAL JOURNAL | VOLUME 232 NO. 6 | MarCh 25 2022\n\u00a9 British Dental association 2022.\nis also a central factor contributing to high caries incidence.\nThis letter is aimed at highlighting the importance of obtaining a full social and dietary history for patients as many can develop work-related habits that can negatively impact their oral health. There is also a need to provide oral health education to members of the public within this field as many of them did not appreciate the detrimental effect of these common habits.\nM. Samuel, E.

The letter from TovaniPalone et al.1 described the role of hospital dentists assisting medical colleagues in the care of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggested greater integration of medical training at undergraduate level. In the same edition, Mather and colleagues analysed changes in learning outcomes for dental students between General Dental Council (GDC) curricula in 1997 (The first five years [TFFY]) and 2015 (Preparing for practice [PfP]).2\nOne element that has reduced significantly between the two curricula is the direction for teaching of human disease. In TFFY, previous guidance on teaching of medicine and surgery was significantly expanded, including that dental students were to attend medical and surgical clinics, and receive instruction in pharmacology and pathology. Curriculum sections, entitled \u2018Joint medical and dental teaching\u2019, \u2018Human disease\u2019 and \u2018General pathology and general microbiology\u2019 emphasised this new direction.\nWhen the first edition of PfP was published, guidance for teaching undergraduates in medical topics had reduced to just a few lines: \u2018Identify general and systemic disease and explain"

We have, anecdotally and through audit, found the form to have improved documentation surrounding the consent process for children. It is our hope that the form could be adapted and modified for use at other NHS trusts and at dental practices, as has happened in the case we respond to.\nAs noted in the article, guidelines in this area are \u2018ever evolving\u2019 and, as such, we wish to highlight where the PRF may be simplified.
