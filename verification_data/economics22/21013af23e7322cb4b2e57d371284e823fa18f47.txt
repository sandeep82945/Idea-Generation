"The findings of this research suggest that both the technological and organizational context of CAIS need to be adequately grounded in construction companies to guarantee optimal EP. Also, the negative relationship obtained in the relationship between EC and EP means that the current operating environment cannot yield a favorable economic performance outcome when CAIS is adopted. Therefore, the government and professional organizations are required to do more by way of enlightening the companies and creating a favorable framework for an economically viable CAIS adoption process."
