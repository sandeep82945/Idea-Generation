This study aimed at investigating the relationship of acne severity and acne-related quality of life with depressive symptoms, and the mediating effect of acne-related quality of life in a relationship between acne severity and depressive symptoms.\nMethods: This is a cross-sectional study. Data were collected from acne patients attending a tertiary-level hospital, using a questionnaire that comprised three validated instruments \u2013 Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (a single item) scale, Cardiff Acne Disability Index, and Beck Depression Inventory for measuring acne severity, acne-related quality of life, and depressive symptoms, respectively. Logistic regression and linear regression were used to examine the association between acne severity and depressive symptoms and a correlation between the acne-related quality of life and depressive symptoms, respectively. A mediation analysis was also performed to see the mediation effects of acne-related quality of life in a relationship between acne severity and depressive symptoms.\nResults: A total of 185 acne patients (155 females, 83.8%) with a mean age was 22.55 \u00b1 8.67 years were included in the study. Adolescents and young adults with severe and moderate acne had 6.14-and 2.28 times higher odds of depression compared to their peers with mild acne, respectively. Patients with low levels of acne-related quality of life had a higher level of depressive symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.42, p < 0.001). The total effect (direct + indirect) was also significant (\u03b2 = 0.27, 95% CI: 1.29\u20134.09), implying the effect of acne severity on depression.\nConclusion: The present study suggests that acne severity and acne-related quality of life were associated with depressive symptoms among patients with acne vulgaris. The study also indicates that the relationship between acne severity and depressive symptoms might occur through a chain-mediating effect of acne disability in this population."

            "text": "Depression is a common mental health disorder and a major contributor to the global burden of disease (James et\u00a0al., 2018). More than 264 million people are suffering from depression globally and among them, 13.4% are children and adolescents, 5% are adults and 5.7% are older adults aged 60 and over (Polanczyk et\u00a0al., 2015; WHO, 2021). Depression is considered a complex condition with many different symptoms and causes (NIH, 2018). A variety of underlying factors, such as biogenic amine deficiency, genetic, environmental, immunologic, endocrine, and neurogenesis, have been identified as mechanisms of the pathophysiology of depression. For example, environmental stressors and heritable genetic factors are thought to trigger immunologic and endocrine responses, which result in structural and functional changes in multiple brain regions, ultimately leading to dysfunctional neurogenesis and neurotransmission that could manifest a constellation of symptoms, which could cause depression (Webster, 2005; Tan et\u00a0al., 2018). Depression can lead to a variety of psychological and physiological problems that can contribute to decreasing one\u2019s ability to function at work and at home (APA, 2020). Further, depression is common among adolescents and young adults (Venkataraman et\u00a0al., 2019). Depression increases the risk of suicide, poor health, unhealthy personal behavior, poor social well-being, and lower educational attainment (Anjum et\u00a0al., 2019; Shukla et\u00a0al., 2019; Khan et\u00a0al., 2020). Mental disorders in most cases are treatable and preventable, although more than 75% of people in low-and middle-income countries remain untreated (WHO, 2021).\nDepression or depressive symptoms among adolescents has become a neglected public health problem in Bangladesh. Adolescents comprise more than 10% of the total population in Bangladesh. Suicidal behavior (e.g., suicidal ideation, suicidal ideation with a plan, attempted suicide), anxiety, loneliness, lack of close friends, and substance use (e.g., tobacco use, alcohol, marijuana, multiple substances) are highly prevalent among them (WHO, 2017). There is an array of factors that can cause depression ranging from socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural to psychological traits such as stress in a relationship, family and peer pressure, high expectations, lack of financial support and hardships, sleep deficiency, future worry about future, loneliness, longer screen time, toxic psychological environment, academic pressure, workload, size, and so on (Brenneisen Mayer et\u00a0al., 2016; Abdel Wahed and Hassan, 2017; Saeed et\u00a0al., 2017; Silva and Figueiredo-Braga, 2018; Al Mamun and Griffiths, 2019; Mridha et\u00a0al., 2021). Similarly, a stressful situation due to acne severity, as this influences psychological status (Behnam et\u00a0al., 2013) may trigger hormonal changes in the body that may cause depression among adolescents and young adults.\nAcne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder. The pathophysiology of acne is characterized by the overproduction of sebum, abnormal keratinization of hair follicles, and the proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes within the pilosebaceous unit. An increased level of androgens at the onset of puberty can stimulate the production of high sebum changes in skin cell activity, inflammation,\nand colonization of the hair follicles by a bacteria known as Propionibacterium acnes, which, in turn, could lead to acne (Walsh, 2009; Jesulola et\u00a0 al., 2018). Acne vulgaris can severely affect psychological functioning and especially may cause anger, anxiety, and depression among adolescents and young adults (Alsulaimani et\u00a0al., 2020). It is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease that usually develops on the face, chest, shoulders, and back. Acne usually starts in adolescence and may extend up to adulthood (Anon, 2013). It can be\u00a0classified as a non-inflammatory type characterized by comedones and an inflammatory type characterized by papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts (Anon, 2018). It is estimated to affect 9.4% of the global population, making it the eighth-most prevalent disease worldwide (Tan and Bhate, 2015). Globally, the estimated prevalence of acne varies from 28.9 to 91.3% among adolescents (Asai et\u00a0al., 2016). In Asian countries such as China, Malaysia, and Saudi, acne vulgaris among adolescents was recorded at over 33, 34, and 56%, respectively (Shen et\u00a0al., 2012; Muthupalaniappen et\u00a0al., 2014; Alanazi et\u00a0al., 2018). Among African countries, Nigeria and Egypt, more than 60% of female adolescents are suffering from acne vulgaris (Okoro et\u00a0al., 2016; El-Hamd et\u00a0 al., 2017). The probable risk factors of acne vulgaris identified in previous studies were socioeconomic conditions such as dietary factors, topical greasy preparations that block skin pores, humid climate, smoking, obesity, stress, picking, and bacterial infections along with genetic and hormonal (Mahapatra, 2016; Heng and Chew, 2020).\nEarlier evidence has shown that psychological issues such as anxiety and depression are found to be\u00a0more prevalent among acne patients (Asad et\u00a0 al., 2002; Darwish and Al-Rubaya, 2013; Khan, 2017). Acne vulgaris can severely affect mental health, especially depression, obsessive-compulsiveness, and sometimes suicidal ideation (Alsulaimani et\u00a0al., 2020; Lukaviciute et\u00a0al., 2020). Previous studies were conducted on the relationship between acne severity and depression in different settings (Asad et\u00a0 al., 2002; Darwish and Al-Rubaya, 2013; Sultana, 2017; Ahmed et\u00a0al., 2019). For example, the severity of acne is positively related to depression, and also acne vulgaris significantly correlated with the quality of life, i.e., deals with daily social and emotional things based on varying degrees of acne severity (Sultana, 2017; Ahmed et\u00a0al., 2019). A recent meta-analytic review (Samuels et\u00a0 al., 2020) demonstrated that acne severity, depression and anxiety are associated, but there is an inconsistency in the included studies between acne-related exposures and outcome ascertainment. The review also concluded that most of the studies had a paucity of suitable designs, measurements, and data analyses. Hence, more research is needed to examine the association of acne severity with depression or depressive symptoms. Moreover, to our knowledge, no study has yet examined the mediation effect of acne-related quality of life on the association of acne severity with depressive symptoms, particularly in Bangladesh. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate (i) the relationship of acne severity with depressive symptoms, (ii) a correlation between acne-related quality of life and depressive symptoms, and (iii) whether acne-related quality of life mediates the relationship between acne severity and depressive symptoms.\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org"

Patients who visited dermatologists for acne vulgaris care in the hospital were randomly selected for the participation. Patients were invited to take part in the study if they met the following inclusion criteria: (i) aged between 12 and 40 years of either sex, (ii) having a diagnosis of acne vulgaris during the period between 21st April 2018 and 21st June 2018, and (iii) attended the outpatient care at the department of dermatology. However, patients with other dermatological diseases/disorders such as Rosacea, Hives, Measles, Lupus, and Melasma were excluded, and no repeated visits were considered in the study. In the data collection process, a dermatologist (JM) and a general physician (TT) checked the patient\u2019s history according to the inclusion criteria. If the patients matched the criteria, they were invited to fill in a survey questionnaire with their consent.\nA self-administered questionnaire comprised of three validated instruments \u2013 Investigator\u2019s Global Assessment (IGA) a single item scale, Cardiff Acne Disability Index (CADI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for measuring acne severity, acne-related quality of life, and depressive symptoms, respectively \u2013 was used to collect data in this study. To facilitate patients\u2019 comprehension, all the instruments \u2013 IGA, CADI, and BDI \u2013 were translated into Bengali. The translation was made by a professional translator who had full professional language proficiency in both Bengali and English. Afterward, the translated instruments were tested on a sample of 10 individuals, comprising both males and females, to confirm whether the questions incorporated in the instruments were well understood. In addition, a set of demographic variables such as age, gender, education, marital status, occupation, and income was included in the questionnaire.\nTwo hundred outpatients were invited by the hospital to take part in the study. Out of 200, a total of 185 completed the survey questionnaire with their informed consent, giving a response rate of 93%. Further, a data collection process, such as filling in the questionnaire and entering the data into the MS-Excel system, was initiated for the patients who agreed to take part in the study, led by an employee in the hospital administration."

The CADI is an instrument that assesses the effect of acne on quality of life, which consists of five-item. The first two-item addresses the psychological and social consequences of acne in general; the third one targets those with acne in exposed areas; the fourth one enquires into the patient\u2019s psychological state, and the last one asks for the patient\u2019s subjective assessment of current acne severity. Respondents answered on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 = not at all to 3 = severely; a higher score indicates a lower level of acne-related quality of life. All items were summed to generate a total CADI score, which is ranging from 0 to 15 points where higher values represent a lower level of acne-related quality of life. Moreover, consideration of a conceptual rather than literal approach in our translation process guaranteed the usage of specific words and phrases reflecting the Bangladeshi culture. The reliability of the scale was measured using Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 in the present study, which was 0.74, indicating an adequate internal consistency. An earlier study also checked internal consistency of a Persian version of CADI was shown almost similar Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 (0.79) (Aghaei et\u00a0al., 2006)."

Around 20% of the participants had job or business. More than 50% of the participants had yearly family income more than 100,000 BDT and around 14% were 300,000 or above. Approximately 70% was seeking any kind of acne treatment before treating in the Department of dermatology. Approximately 43% of the participants had severe acne, and the prevalence of depressive symptoms (mild to severe) was 65%.\nTable\u00a0 2 shows the characteristics of the participants with or without depressive symptoms by background characteristics. Age and\noccupation appeared to be\u00a0significantly different between those who were with depressive symptoms and without depressive symptoms. A total of 65% of participants (aged M \u00b1 SD: 22.02 \u00b1 4.95) reported they had depressive symptoms whereas 35% (aged M \u00b1 SD: 21.98 \u00b1 6.39) reported no depressive symptom. In terms of occupation, 65% of students appeared with depressive symptoms and 35% with no depressive symptoms. Among homemaker, 84% were experienced depressive symptoms and 16% with no depressive symptoms.\nTable\u00a03 represents the results from the multiple logistic regression analysis.

In contrast, some previous studies did not find an association between acne severity and psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression, and stress (Aktan et\u00a0al., 2000; Yola\u00e7 Yarpuz et\u00a0al., 2008). A possible reason for this contradictory result could be\u00a0that individuals with depression in the previous studies might not be\u00a0caused by acne severity (Golchai et\u00a0al., 2010), rather they were experiencing depression due to other reasons, e.g., stress, mood changes, and physical illness (Wahid et\u00a0al., 2021), which were not taken into account in the present study. Further, adolescents\u2019 quality of life from all dimensions of life, e.g., stress from family and other forms of social demand, could enhance psychological burden, e.g., depression (Naz et\u00a0al., 2020). The findings from the present study indicate that acne-related quality of life was also positively connected to depression. This finding is supported by a previous study showing that mild acne vulgaris has a mild impact on quality of life (Ogedegbe and Henshaw, 2014). This finding may suggest that the presence of acne creates problems with patients\u2019 quality of life that may cause mental illnesses such as depression. This may reflect the fact that a patient\u2019s acne-related quality of life should be\u00a0improved rather than only improvement of acne severity (Martin et\u00a0al., 2001; Ammad et\u00a0al., 2008).\nThe result from the present study also indicates that acne-related quality of life had a mediation effect on the relationship between acne\nseverity and depressive symptoms. This finding suggests that besides clinical treatment it would paralleling be\u00a0more effective in propelling acne-related quality of life to treat depression among adolescents and young adult patients with acne vulgaris (Tayel et\u00a0al., 2020; Kaikati et\u00a0al., 2021). Given the concern of depression due to acne, it is critical that physicians monitor the mood symptoms of patients with acne and begin early depression management or seek consultation from a psychiatrist when needed. A descriptive study conducted in Bangladesh demonstrated that evaluation of the acne-related quality of life is more effective and helpful for better psychological treatment and management in adolescent and adult patients with acne (Rahman et\u00a0al., 2022)."

To our best knowledge, this is the first study to examine the mediation effect of acne-related quality of life in the relationship between acne severity and depression, although previous studies investigated the association of acne severity and acnerelated quality of life with depression in different settings. There are several limitations of this study that should be\u00a0considered. One of the potential limitations is that Type II error could occur in this study due to a small sample size, which could decrease the reliability of the study. Similarly, the probability of Type I\u00a0error could also occur because of the significance levels of hypothesis test was chosen. Having a dichotomized variable of depression in this study could lead to a loss of information, which could impact the accuracy of the analysis and increase the risk of a positive result being a false positive. Moreover, due to a small sample size, we\u00a0 did not consider all potential confounding variables in this study. Another potential limitation is that use of self-reported measure that may fail to reflect the actual clinical condition of the patients, which could lead to common method bias in the results. Depression might already be\u00a0an existing condition due to other reasons that did not investigate in this study. Because the survey was cross-sectional, a cause-and-effect relationship could not be\u00a0drawn for this study.

Simultaneously, depressive symptoms among acne vulgaris patients can also be\u00a0alleviated by promoting the relief of acne-related quality of life, rather than only focusing on acne severity. To prevent the development of negative psychology, medical staff and public health practitioners should encourage and unite family members, friends, and community members to provide comprehensive support to patients, which may contribute to alleviating depression. The findings of this study may also be\u00a0used for planning and implementing interventions to improve and promote the quality of life of patients with acne. Moreover, psychotherapists could support patients on how to deal with mental stress such as anxiety and depression due to acne severity."

The study has also confirmed that acne severity may not directly relate to depressive symptoms in this population, rather the relationship might occur through a chain mediating effect of acne-related quality of life. This research has practical guidance for dermatologists to provide a more holistic management approach to treat acne vulgaris whilst the patients are getting used to suffering from depressive symptoms due to acne vulgaris."
