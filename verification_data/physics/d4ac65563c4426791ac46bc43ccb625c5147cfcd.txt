"In this study, we developed a framework based on NG to establish an upper bound on the dynamics of a specific subset of CRNs. The physical meaning of this bound relates to the concept of entropy production, which in turn is related to the speed of convergence of the chemical reaction. The nonlinearity commonly present in CRNs presents a challenge, which is addressed here. The optimization problem in the NG derivation was found to be related to entropy production, enriching the understanding of NG within a thermodynamic context. While the primary focus has been on CRNs, the methods and discussions are applicable to a wider range of hypergraph dynamics."
