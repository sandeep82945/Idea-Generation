    "abstractText": "Carbon emission trading is an important environmental policy tool to promote carbon emission reduction. With the panel data of carbon emissions trading (CET) pilots, this paper used the spatial difference-in-difference model (SDID) to test whether CET can affect the enterprise environmental responsibility and the spatial spillover effect of carbon emissions trading. The study found that CET can significantly improve the environmental responsibility level of enterprises in pilot areas. The environmental responsibility level of enterprises in surrounding areas are also improved driven by CET. In the time dimension, the role of CET in improving the enterprise environmental responsibility is gradually increasing. The impact of CET on enterprise environmental responsibility has significant heterogeneity in the dimension of ownership attributes and environmental regulation. Promoting corporate environmental protection investment is the main path for CET to improve the enterprise environmental responsibility.",

            "text": "Since the vision of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality was put forward, how to encourage industrial enterprises and other greenhouse gas emitters to take the initiative to take responsibility for social environmental protection, maintain economic momentum, and consciously participate in carbon emission reduction, has become the focus of national economic growth and the transition to green and low-carbon economy. Meanwhile, the timetable for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality also means new pressures and challenges for the current economic development. Compared with the major developed countries that have achieved decoupling of carbon emissions and economy, China is still the largest energy consumer in the world, with the high carbon emission intensity (Dilanchiev and Taktakishvili 2022).\nTherefore, China\u2019s carbon emissions are still in the growth stage. Under such circumstances, how to take into account the dual goals of environmental protection, especially carbon emission control and economic development, has become an important issue that governments at all levels need to solve urgently. Ecological finance focuses on the relationship between environmental regulation and financial and social growth. There is a complex trade-off between ecological conservation and financial development for many nations, particularly emerging countries, because of the severity of climate change and pollution. Financial development, foreign expenditure, employment, and human capital have all been studied concerning ecological rules (Chabi Simin Najib et\u00a0al. 2022). However, they have yet to come to a unanimous decision. Positive effects of ecological legislation were discovered by some researchers, but others discovered unfavorable results. These adverse effects included pollutant transfer, \u201cbeggar-thy-neighbor,\u201d and avoidance actions on the part of businesses. While neoclassical finance holds that ecological regulations stifle financial development, the Porter hypothesis argues that well-designed regulations may spur innovation in the technology sector.\nThe fact that there are three primary categories of environmental regulations state, market-driven, and societal participation\u2014means that these disagreements are not\nResponsible Editor: Ilhan Ozturk\n* Hong Chen 201672075@yangtzeu.edu.cn\n1 The National University of\u00a0Malaysia, 43600\u00a0Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia\n2 Institute of\u00a0Petroleum Engineering, Yangtze University, Wuhan\u00a0430000, Hubei, China\n1 3\nmutually exclusive. The policy impacts of various ecological legislation vary. But several reports have revealed that state rules are problematic in various ways (Dilanchiev et\u00a0 al. 2021). Some researchers have shown that market-based environmental policies can improve ecological management in recent years. Carbon trading has been shown to reduce global welfare losses by 0.1 to 0.5 percentage points compared to studies without it. The EU Emissions Trading System reportedly increased low-carbon innovation by ten percentage points for regulated firms without interfering with the development of other patents, as stated by. In addition, some studies have shown that market-driven ecological regulation may cut down on emission reduction costs (Naz et\u00a0 al. 2021), lower regional energy consumption, boost efficiency in resource allocation, and make the Porter effect a reality (Huang et\u00a0al. 2022). China\u2019s carbon emission reduction strategy will become more stringent and have more effect after the country\u2019s carbon peaking. Carbon neutralization targets are realized, and the country\u2019s national carbon market is implemented. Stabilizing growth is a significant problem for the Chinese state in light of the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and the considerable uncertainty and danger of recession in the global economy. High-carbon enterprises are the backbone of the carbon market, so the Chinese state needs to conduct a thorough evaluation of how ETS will affect the operations and future growth of these companies if it wants to strike a healthy balance between promoting the national carbon market and carrying out ecological ecosystem administration and steady development (Batool et\u00a0al. 2022; Liu et\u00a0al. 2022).\nFor a business to be considered influential in its industry, it must leverage its competitive advantages to charge premium pricing and reap excessive profits and returns. Market power is a firm\u2019s capacity to charge more than it costs to produce a unit of product (Solangi et\u00a0al. 2018). Companies with little to no sway in the market may only charge what the competition charges for their products or drop their prices to meet consumers halfway while still making a profit. According to, a company\u2019s market strength is its ability to outperform rivals in the same sector and earn more profits. The fair measurement of a company\u2019s market strength is a topic of debate (Dilanchiev and Taktakishvili 2021). Growth potential, market share, profitability, and expenditure prospects are four broad indicators.\nThe policy tools to control carbon emissions are rich, such as the mandatory environmental businesses that produce a lot of pollution have their data made public. But the carbon emission trading system is the most market-regulated and intrinsically driven alternative to the rigidity and shortterm incentive impact of mandated administrative control (CET) (Wahid et\u00a0al. 2020). Tragic external uneconomic occurrence known as \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d sometimes occurs with natural resources since they are a public benefit. By allocating carbon emission rights quotas and enforcing\nstrict emission caps, the trading mechanism can incentivize businesses to modify their production activities, increase expenditure on low-carbon technology innovation, and take the initiative to assume responsibility for ecological protection (Chang et\u00a0al. 2022). Established carbon trading markets may be found in major industrialized economies like the European Union as early as 2002. With 24 nations and over 12,000 industrial businesses participating, the EU ETS has become the world\u2019s most powerful transnational carbon emissions trading system (Chang et\u00a0al. 2022).\nIndustrial firms, particularly those with significant carbon emissions, need to be encouraged to lead the way in reducing carbon emissions to meet their social obligation of preserving the natural world. Listed companies in heavily polluting industries like thermal power, steel, cement, and electrolytic aluminum are required to regularly release ecological reports and disclose information on pollutant emissions and ecological management per the \u201cGuidelines for Environmental Information Disclosure of Listed Companies\u201d issued in 2010 by the Ministry of Environmental Protection. In 2011, China authorized the exploration of the carbon trading market, with the initial pilot zones being in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Hubei, Guangdong, and Shenzhen. Is it true that CET has prevented the \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d associated with carbon emissions in businesses? Do geographical spillover effects result from this market-oriented external management of the environment? The above study has significant practical and strategic implications for the effective development of the recently created national carbon emission trading market and the rapid achievement of the carbon peaking objective in 2040.\nMost prominently, the following represent the new developments: to begin, this study unifies CET and ER with a focus on the effect of environmental regulation on businesses, providing a novel look at the topic from a ground-level perspective. This article further examines the CET\u2019s geographical spillover impact to overcome the estimated bias. In addition, this work addresses the gap in the literature by analyzing the mechanisms through which CET influences corporate ecological responsibility along expenditure pathways."

Ecological accords may be a game changer when it comes to saving the planet and funding new technologies. Each nation is acting in defiance of the existing ecological accords and is trying to profit from the emission decreases\n1 3\nmade by others (Chang et\u00a0al. 2022). After the Kyoto Protocol expires, propose a new strategy for environmental agreements, where a stable coalition may be established if more nations join the multilateral ecological accord and propose an allocation principle with stability constraints for countries to reap extra advantages from environmental accords to solve the issue of free-riding by nations. Repeated game theory was used to examine global ecological accords between unequal nations (Chang et\u00a0al. 2023). They discovered that the selection rate of punishing nations is unrelated to the stability of global ecological accords but is correlated with the benefit\u2013cost ratios of the two types of countries. However, researchers have yet to get in on environmental games played in large organizations. Therefore, it is essential to study the tactics used by businesses in this context.\nSustainable growth and corporate social responsibility are two strategic strategies that encourage a shift in corporate culture and, by extension, employee values, and behavior that benefit society and the ecosystem. In recent years, environmental concerns have become a major obstacle for businesses aiming for long-term growth and prosperity. Environmental conservation standards have acknowledged green product technology as a means to reduce tensions between business expansion and ecological conservation. Researchers have shown that green commodity innovation encourages businesses to care for the ecosystem and gives customers more confidence in \u201cgreen trust.\u201d Companies of all sizes, especially larger ones, may benefit from adopting CSR policies (Chang et\u00a0al. 2022b). Green product innovation is a lasting competitive advantage for businesses involved in ecological preservation efforts. CSR may assist organizations in achieving sustainable growth by increasing green product innovation and creating distinctive uniqueness. Financial market manipulation, insider trading, and criminal activities may all be avoided with the help of corporate social responsibility initiatives. Furthermore, the nature of the enterprise\u2019s sustainability activities will determine the form in which multi-stakeholder payments for sustainability will take place. There has been an uptick in the number of people who are prepared to buy green product technologies from businesses; these people are now looking at variables beyond just the bottom line and if businesses undertake sustainability initiatives, their value increases in the eyes of potential investors (Wang et\u00a0al. 2023). As shown by involvement in meaningful community events, sustainable development techniques and corporate social responsibility were found to increase product value and influence customer decisions (Chang et\u00a0al. 2022a).\u00a0Corporate social responsibility is a sense of responsibility, and in general this trait can inspire good deeds, but imposing CSR does not serve its purpose. In light of these views, public policy has been reshaped to encourage better and steer sustainability transitions, with energy systems as the focus point (Chang et\u00a0al.\n2023). Taking the proper steps toward sustainable development will significantly impact the health of ecosystems. However, most studies on sustainability transitions have concentrated on the energy, construction, and infrastructure industries, leaving the steel sector with a shortage of data. Slow but steady progress is being made toward a low-carbon energy future in the iron and steel sector. In light of the steel firm\u2019s high energy usage, pollution levels, and carbon footprint, switching to a low-carbon economy is a daunting job fraught with difficulty and significant obstacles. This research has the potential to facilitate a low-carbon energy transition in the steel sector (Chang et\u00a0al. 2022f)."

            "text": "The macro impact of CET is mainly concentrated in pollutant emissions, regional innovation efficiency, and economic growth. Iqbal et\u00a0al. (2022) found that CET can significantly promote the reduction of carbon emissions in the region, which is sustainable. Mohsin et\u00a0al. (2020b) found that the total emission of pollutants in pilot areas was significantly lower than that in non-pilot areas, and such emission reduction effect increased year by year. found that CET and regional innovation efficiency exists U-shaped nonlinear relationship. Agyekum et\u00a0al. (2021) also supported that there is a nonlinear relationship between carbon trading and regional economic growth. Though the initial allocation of carbon emission rights affects regional innovation investment and even inhibit short-term economic growth, CET has obvious effect on promoting innovation and regional economy in the long run.\nMicro impact of\u00a0CET on\u00a0enterprise value realization\nThe micro-impact of CET on the enterprise level mainly focuses on the technological innovation, production efficiency, and financial performance of the enterprise (Sueyoshi et\u00a0al. 2017). used the double difference to evaluate how the CET influence the enterprises, whose results showed that CET can not significantly promote technological innovation during the sample period, while pointed out that the CTE can significantly affect the level of technological innovation of enterprises. In addition to the impact of technological innovation and production efficiency, Ikram et\u00a0al. (2019) found that the CET can also effectively improve the value and financial performance of enterprises. The impact of carbon trading on the enterprise level is mostly positive, but different research perspectives lead to different conclusions. reported that CET improves the short-term value of enterprises, while the impact on the long-term value is not significant. even pointed out that the CET reduced the total factor productivity of enterprises.\n1 3\nThe environmental regulation and\u00a0enterprise environmental responsibility\nIn order to avoid fines or suspend business for rectification, enterprises generally take the initiative to take environmental protection measures and assume corresponding environmental responsibilities. Administrative regulations and punitive measures are the direct influencing factors for enterprises to undertake environmental responsibility. Obviously, as the \u201cvisible hand,\u201d environmental regulation contributes to the allocation of environmental resources. Relevant scholars had conducted in-depth analysis on how environmental regulatory measures adopted by China affect enterprise environmental responsibility, among which the suggestion of environmental regulation has a lag effect\u00a0on the environmental responsibility.\u00a0Zhang et\u00a0al. (2021) also found that the environmental regulation helps to improve the enterprise environmental responsibility. In addition, regardless of the empirical data or questionnaire survey data of listed companies on the SME board, both found that environmental regulation measures can significantly improve the enterprise environmental responsibility (Xia et\u00a0al. 2020).\nCET not only has the flexibility of market-oriented adjustment but also has promoting effect on corporate carbon emission reduction and even the realization of corporate performance value (Shah et\u00a0al. 2019). However, the impact of the CET on enterprise environmental responsibility is worthy of further exploration. As a major participant in carbon trading and a market player in carbon emission reduction, the environmental information disclosure and environmental responsibility level of enterprises are directly related to whether the emission reduction effect of carbon emission trading can be fully exerted. In addition, considering the impact of CET on the environmental responsibility of surrounding companies, this paper takes the spatial spillover effect into consideration. Therefore, this paper analyzes how the CET influences the enterprise environmental responsibility using SDID, and tests its mechanism of action, to provide reference empirical evidence for accelerating the construction of the national carbon trading market (Mohsin et\u00a0al. 2020a).\nMechanism analysis of\u00a0CET affecting enterprise environmental responsibility\nAs a public resource, air has the typical characteristics of competition. The lack of carbon emission limit can lead to the \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d situation, where the company\u2019s actual carbon emissions exceed the optimal amount (Iqbal et\u00a0al. 2019). The core of CET to promote carbon emission reduction is how the government or the market allocates\ncarbon emission quotas to enterprises. Enterprises can sell excess allowances or purchase additional allowances according to their own needs and economic development trends, which helps to flexibly adjust their production, operation, and management models (Asbahi et\u00a0al. 2019). Considering that environmental resources involve public interests, the government often takes strong measures in the face of severe environmental pollution and carbon emission reduction, such as taking the lead in including high-carbon emission industries and enterprises into the priority control rankings (Mohsin et\u00a0al. 2022). Enterprises whose carbon emissions exceed their own allowances will be urged to purchase additional allowances. Meanwhile, companies that under-report or under-report carbon emissions face heavy fines or administrative restrictions. Under above circumstances, enterprises usually consciously increase the level of environmental protection investment, improve technical processes, increase low-carbon innovation, and improve their awareness of environmental responsibility. In addition, the profit-seeking nature of corporate investors will actively promote the integration of enterprises into the carbon trading system. In order to gain long-term benefits, companies are required to reduce carbon emissions as much as possible to sell excess carbon allowances. Such approach can not only avoid the loss of purchasing additional carbon allowances but also invest the proceeds from the sale of surplus carbon allowances into the low-carbon technological innovation of enterprises, which contributes to the sustainable development. Therefore, the inherent incentive effect of CET on corporate environmental investment and environmental responsibility awareness will be fully exerted (Mohsin et\u00a0al. 2021a).\nMeanwhile, environmental regulation was confirmed to have significant spatial correlation characteristics. The implementation of environmental regulation can form demonstration effect on the environmental regulation in the surrounding areas, and further produce spatial spillover effect on the economic development and environmental governance of the surrounding areas. Therefore, the implementation of CET may not only affect the environmental responsibility level of local enterprises but also affect that in surrounding areas (Mohsin et\u00a0al. 2018). Since different regions can design the operating rules of the carbon trading market according to their own economic and industrial characteristics, enterprises with high degree of environmental regulation in their regions will face stricter carbon emission verification and higher penalties for violations, which means that the impact of CET on enterprise environmental responsibility may have heterogeneous characteristics. The above analysis is theoretical inference. Whether CET promotes the improvement of the environmental responsibility level of local and surrounding enterprises still needs to be tested through practical data."

This paper reports the estimation results based on the DID and SDID methods, respectively, where the model 1 and model 3 do not consider the control variables. The results show that the estimated coefficient of the independent variable Treat \u00d7 Time is significantly positive at the 1% confidence level, indicating that CET can indeed significantly enhance the enterprise environmental responsibility. The estimated coefficient of the spatial lag term of the independent variable is also significantly positive, which means that CET also helps to improve the environmental responsibility level of enterprises in surrounding areas. Compared with the DID method, SDID takes into account the spatial spillover effect, whose estimation results are more accurate (Liu et\u00a0al. 2023). The reason is that CET has led to more stringent environmental\nregulations faced by enterprises. To maintain market competitiveness, enterprises need to improve their environmental responsibility level. Furthermore, CET can form positive demonstration effect and promote environmental governance in surrounding areas."

The results are shown in Table\u00a04. The independent variables in model 1 show that the improvement effect of CET on the enterprise environmental responsibility has been strengthened year by year. Especially in the first 3\u00a0years of policy implementation, the promotion effect is more obvious (Li and Umair 2023). The above results support that the local environmental supervision system has become more and more perfect, and the enthusiasm of enterprises to participate in carbon trading has continued to increase, which has continuously strengthened the awareness of enterprise environmental responsibility. Model 2 reports the dynamic impact of CET on enterprise environmental responsibility in surrounding areas. The results show that the spatial spillover effect of the CET has lag characteristic, which becomes significant until the third year after the policy is implemented. Moreover, such spatial spillover effect shows an ever-increasing trend."

Based on the similar measurement ideas above, this paper selects the environmental management disclosure indicators of listed companies in the CSMAR database to measure the enterprise (Hosseinzadeh Lotfi et\u00a0al. 2011) environmental responsibility. The regression results show that the coefficients of the independent variable and its spatial lag term are significant, which means the previous conclusions are robust. (2) Adjust the sample period. In order to clarify how the CET influence enterprise environmental responsibility, and to exclude the negative impact of a long sample study period, this paper only retains the sample data in 2012 and 2014. The regression results show that the coefficients of independent variable and its spatial lag term are significantly positive. (3) Counterfactual testing (Rehman et\u00a0al. 2021). This paper constructs \u201ccounterfactual\u201d by randomly selecting other non-pilot areas as treatment groups to eliminate the influence of unobservable factors. The regression results show that the coefficients of independent variable and its spatial lag term are not statistically significant, indicating that the increase in the enterprise environmental responsibility is not caused by factors other than the implementation of carbon trading policies. Consequently, the robustness of the estimation results is confirmed."

Table\u00a05 displays the empirical findings of model 1 for state-owned enterprises and model 2 for nonstate-owned enterprises. Independent variable coefficients are positive and statistically significant, with the nonstate-owned enterprise group\u2019s coefficient statistically and practically more significant than the state-owned firm groups (Mart\u00ednez et\u00a0al. 2021). This is likely because private companies may more efficiently respond to market fluctuations, modify output accordingly, spend more on environmental safeguards, and reap the rewards of the carbon trading market.\nThe heterogeneity in regional ecological regulation is shown in (2). The low ecological regulation degree group\u2019s empirical findings are represented by model 3, whereas the high environmental regulation degree group\u2019s results are presented by model 4. One may see this most clearly when comparing the coefficients of groups with different levels of environmental management (Fang et\u00a0al. 2022; Pan et\u00a0al. 2023). One probable explanation is that the regulations governing the\ncarbon trading market may be tailored to the needs of specific areas. Businesses subject to stringent external environmental control are more likely to proactively safeguard the environment and take on environmental duties, such as verifying carbon emissions and increasing fines for violations."

            "text": "Ecological expenditure is essential, whether producing environmentally friendly goods or enhancing methods to eliminate the \u201cthree wastes.\u201d To determine if CET positively affects business ecological preservation expenditure and, in consequence, company ecological responsibility performance, this research focuses primarily on the action route based on Invest. For a summary, see Table\u00a06. In model 1, we see how CET affects ecological expenditure by businesses, and in model 2, we see how those investments affect businesses\u2019 commitment to environmental responsibility (Wu et\u00a0al. 2022). The coefficient for the independent variable in model 1 is shown to be substantially positive at the one percent level, suggesting that CET has successfully encouraged businesses to boost their spending on environmental protection. Also, CET has had a primarily favorable effect on environmental investment by regional businesses. In addition, model 2\u2019s findings confirm that enterprises may benefit significantly from increasing their spending on ecological preservation thanks to the positive influence of the business ecological preservation expenditure. In light of the above, CET has determined that funding ecological preservation for corporations (Glenk and Reichelstein 2019) is a crucial strategy for improving corporate ecological responsibility in the community. Ecological preservation awareness will be firmly ingrained in a corporate culture if CET is fully implemented, motivating businesses to incorporate environmental protection investment into dynamic behaviors in day-to-day business operations.\nThe Chinese state may push SCR to adopt energy-saving, low-carbon, clean manufacturing technologies because of the carbon peak and the carbon\u2013neutral aim. The current state of pollution control technology includes recycling different pollutants, a technically more complex approach than carbon emission abatement innovation (Sherman et\u00a0al.\n2020). These innovations are often disruptive substantive advances, making them more challenging to execute. While sintering flue gas circulation technology is still in its infancy, carbon reduction technologies like hydrogen metallurgy have advanced to the promotion and implementation phase in POPU. Therefore, by expanding expenditure on pollution and carbon decrease innovations that work in tandem, the technical process may be enhanced, leading to more remarkable green growth outcomes. As a first step in our study, we examine how steel companies have fared in the past and how they are faring now when spending money on measures to reduce air pollution, all while using the state subsidy system. The evolutionary game process is achieved in five instances where the input\u2013output ratio of air pollution control inputs varies throughout the interval. For best results, consider scenario 5. Both steel companies select the (Liu and Wang 2020) \u201cD\u201d tactic. This is the best-case situation since the input\u2013output ratios of both parties are linked to free-riding behavior profits, input costs, state subsidies, and returns from generating shared products. It will be challenging to manage a firm if state subsidies and advantages for manufacturing ordinary things are reduced, and profits from free-riding behavior and input costs are not sustainable in the long-term.\nThe requirements for the success of a carbon quota trading method are then derived, and four distinct types of carbon quota trading method scenarios are examined. Cases 7 and 8, with only one ROA, are the worst-case scenarios. Case 6 is a potential ideal scenario due to the use of two distinct ROA. The best possible scenario is instance 9, where the combined carbon quotas sold by the two steel companies exceed the minimum required by the state. Because of this, both businesses will benefit from efforts to reduce air pollution, and there will be no free-riding on either side. In addition, in example 9, companies benefit the most from both state subsidies and revenue from the sale of carbon permits.\nUtilizing a market-based system, the ETS primarily achieves the internalization of the external cost of reducing carbon emissions by businesses. The administration sets a total carbon emission goal. Then, it uses the allocation concept of suitable tightening to give out a limited number of carbon emission permits to high-carbon businesses. When the state requires businesses to reduce their carbon emissions, but their emissions exceed their quota, the businesses must buy additional permits from the carbon market (Ke et\u00a0al. 2011).\nWhen dealing with the SOE system, high-carbon businesses have two options: continually implement measures like process efficiency and innovation transition to lower their carbon intensity level or buy carbon quotas from the carbon market to cover their over-emissions (Chowdhury et\u00a0al. 2018). This will lead to rising extra costs for reducing carbon emissions for high-carbon businesses, harming their\n1 3\nproduct price flexibility and profit level, and weakening their market position.\nIn addition, the control factors of size, asset-liability ratio, per capita wage, labor effectiveness, and cost density significantly affect the competitive strength of high-carbon businesses. Column 5 of Table\u00a07 displays the regression findings, which show that the enterprise size coefficient is 0.0686, statistically significant at the 1% level, demonstrating that business size positively affects enterprise market power. Larger companies tend to take advantage of economies of scale and use cutting-edge strategies for reducing emissions. While doing so, businesses often improve their market share by increasing production size, which boosts their profitability, pricing power, and overall market dominance (Lee and Mason 2011).\nWith a correlation of \u2212 0.6865, significant at the 1% level, the asset-liability ratio negatively correlates with market dominance. Significant at the 5% and 1% levels, respectively, are the per capita pay and labor efficiency coefficients of 0.0580 and 0.1986. This demonstrates that the market strength of businesses is enhanced by increases in both the average income and the productivity of their workforce. Businesses that pay their workers more per hour and use their resources more efficiently tend to recruit better workers overall. Businesses that have access to top-tier personnel are better able to innovate and increase their productivity and value creation. As a result, it helps businesses boost their earnings and competitiveness (Hodgson 1988). Additionally, businesses with higher income levels have more significant needs for advanced skills and information. These businesses often fall under the category of those with a high valueadded capacity and a sizable share of the market.\nCost density level positively affects the market power of relevant firms, as shown by the coefficient of 2.6441, which is statistically significant at the 1% level. Companies spend\nmore on advertising and marketing in response to intense market rivalry to increase the visibility of their goods and services, boost sales, and increase their market share (Dhak 2015). The carbon market pilot program may have varying effects in China\u2019s eastern, central, and western regions due to disparities in factor endowments, policy trends, science and technology expenditure, and financial growth (Y\u0131lmaz Balaman et\u00a0al. 2018). According to the location of the company\u2019s official address, the research sample is split into three categories for regression analysis. The regression results are shown in Table\u00a010. While central and western businesses saw little benefit from the pilot policy\u2019s emphasis on ROA, those in the east saw significant gains. The eastern region has a substantially more favorable capital ecosystem, which means that market-based ecological regulation may boost competitiveness among local businesses and increase ROA in that area. These all belong to the differences of corporate management structure.\u00a0We use principal component analysis to develop the index for measuring the internal state of governance, following the lead of the literature. We choose the following as our secondary measures: the number of directors on the board, the proportion of independent directors, the total compensation of the top three executives, the shareholding ratio of senior executives, the degree of equity balance, and the shareholding ratio of organizational shareholders. Scores on the first central primary element are used as an indicator of the quality of corporate management. Subgroup regression is then performed, using the mean value of enterprise governa`nce before the pilot policy as the dependent variable."

Additionally, the disparate effects of CET on businesses with varying characteristics and subject to varying external ecological standards are covered. Some key takeaways are as follows: for starters, CET has the potential further to enhance the already impressive environmental responsibilities of businesses in the immediate region and beyond. Second, CET primarily enhances company environmental responsibility by raising firm ecological protection spending. Third, CET has a variable effect on corporate ecological responsibility, having a more considerable influence in non-state-owned firms and regions with stricter environmental rules.\nIn light of the above, this research suggests implementing CET adjustments to optimize it. To begin, carbon tradingeligible businesses may be directed to expand ecological expenditure by local, state, and federal administrations via subsidies and the creation of special funds. Second, carbon\n1 3\ntrading plays an increasingly important role every year in enhancing enterprises\u2019 environmental responsibilities. Therefore, while developing and refining its operational regulations, the national carbon trading market should focus on policy continuity, particularly the policy\u2019s robustness in the first 3\u00a0years. Thirdly, setting the particular working group to flexibly and scientifically calculate carbon quotas and guide enterprises to implement carbon reduction work step-by-step, mainly state-owned businesses. This is especially important because different industries and regions have different characteristics, such as the enterprises\u2019 scale, capacity burden, and financial status. The government also has to ramp up its low-carbon messaging. For example, businesses\u2019 knowledge of their environmental duty may be raised using the carbon market platform. Last but not least, carbon trading strategies may be implemented in tandem with other methods of ecological regulation, with an eye on the impact of environmental regulation on these policies\u2019 efficacy. The administration encourages the carbon market by creating a system of rewards and penalties and by offering tax breaks to businesses that take measures to reduce their carbon footprint.\nAuthor contribution Hong Chen was responsible for the conception of research ideas and data collection.\nData availability The data that support the findings of this study are openly available on request."
