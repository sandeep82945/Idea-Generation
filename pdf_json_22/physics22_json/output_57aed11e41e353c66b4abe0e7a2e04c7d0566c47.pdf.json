Organic based photodetectors are commonly referred to as OPDs; whilst we will use this term here, we note that most of the principles discussed and some of the examples provided involve hybrid or perovskitebased devices. Several OPD device architectures have been considered and strategies to improve device performance (e.g. multi-terminal devices, rational material design and modification of charge injection or extraction interfaces) are emerging.12 The circularly selective optical response of chiral functional materials makes them an exciting prospect for direct detection of CP light without the need for external optics.13 To this end, a variety of organic and organic\u2013inorganic chiral materials have been developed.14,15 Due to the strong focus of recent studies on maximising the CP selectivity of detectors, conventional non-CP figures of merit have been largely sidelined. This has led to poor overall performances of devices reported to date, limiting their suitability for widespread application of CP OPDs in real-world technologies. Furthermore, the rapidly growing highly interdisciplinary nature of the research field has resulted in a variety of characterisation protocols, and incomplete reporting of figures of merit, rendering meaningful comparisons between different materials and device architectures a challenge. The development and use of common standards, which were essential for the commercialisation of photovoltaics, photodetectors and light emitting diodes, are desperately needed. a Department of Physics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, UK b Centre for Processable Electronics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, UK.

We propose a standardised means of reporting their key figures of merit, including Linear Dynamic Range (LDR), Bandwidth and Responsivity. As recent reviews have focussed on the design of materials capable of detecting circularly polarised light and the characterisation of their chiroptical response, we do not provide a further comprehensive review of those aspects here. Instead, we direct readers to several recent and detailed review articles.13\u201316 Here we carefully set out the performance metrics and instrumentation essential to characterise device performance and CP selectivity of OPDs based on chiral functional materials. We hope that this tutorial review serves to advance the field, such that CP OPDs with device performances and sensitivities compatible with the demands of real-world sensing can be realised.\nWe first provide a brief introduction to the materials systems of current state-of-the-art CP OPDs. We then describe the operating principles of the three most common photodetectors (photodiodes, photoconductors, and phototransistors) and outline the standardised figures of merit of these devices. We conclude by outlining strategies to make testing protocols more robust, which should result in standardised evaluation and reporting of device performance."

            "text": "There are several materials characteristics which are desirable in the pursuit of high-performance photodetectors, including large optical absorption coefficients and long recombination times. Advances in molecular design have improved the spectral sensitivity of and charge transport in non-chiral organic and hybrid organic\u2013inorganic materials, although some of these strategies do not transfer cleanly to chiral materials due to inherent differences in molecular shape, packing, etc.\nOrganic semiconductors display much lower dielectric constants than their inorganic counterparts (er B 3.5 vs. er Z 10), which results in the formation of Coulombically bound electron\u2013hole pairs (excitons) under optical excitation. As thermal dissociation is highly improbable in a low dielectric constant medium, the generation of free charges in organic semiconductors typically requires the intermixing of two semiconductors with suitable energetics to yield a heterojunction between an electron donating and an electron accepting component.17 The electron accepting or electron donating character of the organic semiconductor is controlled through chemical design, for example by incorporating electron withdrawing or donating groups into the molecular structure.\nUntil recently, the most common selection of non-chiral materials in OPDs comprised homopolymer donors, such as P3HT, or push\u2013pull polymers (PTB7-Th, PBDB-T, PTQ10), in combination with fullerene-based acceptors (see Fig. 1).18,19 Recently, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), such as IDTBR, have\nemerged as alternatives to fullerene-based acceptors with broader spectral photosensitivity and improved long-term morphological stability whilst retaining good charge-transport properties.18,19 Most NFAs make use of push-pull hybridisation, which allows them to absorb strongly in the visible and NIR region of the solar spectrum, achieving higher voltage outputs compared to fullerene-based alternatives.18,19\nAlongside organic semiconductors, hybrid organic\u2013inorganic materials (e.g., perovskites) are popular candidates for photodetection, owing to their remarkable charge carrier mobilities and high optical absorption. Further, perovskites have large dielectric constants (er B 20\u201350), which circumvents the need for heterojunctions to efficiently generate free charges.20\nBuilding on this large body of information for non-chiral OPD materials, there have been increasing efforts to develop chiral materials suitable for use in CP OPDs. These include chiral small molecules, polymers, metal-organic frameworks, and perovskites. Such materials allow for the selective absorption of one sign of CP light over the other. Furthermore, other phenomena, such as spin-polarisation in organic and hybrid semiconductors, can be manipulated as a function of their molecular chirality.21 For thin films of chiral materials, the absorption sensitivity to CP light is quantified by the absorbance dissymmetry or g-factor:16\ngabs \u00bc AL AR\n1 2 \u00f0AL \u00fe AR\u00de\n\u00bc AL AR Absmeas\n(1)\nHere AL and AR describe the absorbance of left-handed (LH) and right-handed (RH) light. It should be noted that the measured absorption expression does not account for reflection losses occurring at the front and back surfaces of thin films. It is possible to mitigate for these reflection losses by calculating the corrected absorbance of the photoactive layer of thickness d:22\nAbscorr \u00bc a\nln\u00f010\u00ded (2)\nHere a can be determined by measuring the apparent absorbance (Absmeas) as a function of film thickness (d) and calculated using the following expression:\nAbsmeas \u00bc log\u00f01 R\u00de2 \u00fe a\nln 10\u00f0 \u00ded (3)\nwhere the term in (1 R)2 accounts for reflection losses of a freestanding film.

Note that the analogous definitions of responsivity dissymmetry (gR) and external quantum efficiency dissymmetry (gEQE) used in literature are mathematically identical to gph for the same intensity and wavelength of incident light, and as such will not be defined here (see ESI\u2021).\nFrom a molecular perspective, gabs depends on the strength and relative orientation of the electric (l) and magnetic (m) transition dipole moments.15 For most molecular systems, |m| { |l|, which results in vanishingly small dissymmetry factors (gabs B 10\n4\u201310 3). Strategies have emerged to increase gabs, including rational molecular design, the formation of supramolecular chiral structures in which considerable gabs can be achieved through circular-selective scattering, and coupling between excited states on nearby chromophores.23\u201329 For example, in the solid-state, systems based on achiral p-conjugated polymers blended with chiral small molecule additives can give rise to very large gabs (40.1).30 However, these approaches can come at a cost: the twisted molecular structures required in these approaches can compromise molecular packing and impede charge transport."

In this scenario, photogenerated carriers can traverse the active layer for several cycles before recombining, with the average number of cycles equivalent to Ga (Fig. 3). This enables the ratio of electrons extracted as photocurrent and incident photons (i.e., EQE) to exceed 100%.\nPerovskites are particularly well suited to the photoconductor geometry due to their large effective carrier mobilities (0.1\u201310 cm2 V 1 s 1) and long carrier lifetimes (10 6 s), which enables significant Ga.\n20,32\u201334 Carriers with long tRec persist once the light is switched off, which means that these devices can be slow to respond and have low bandwidths. Chiral perovskite photoconductors generally suffer from poor CP selectivity in absorption (gabs) owing to weak intrinsic chiroptical activity, however a number of recent examples have demonstrated that reducing the dimensionality of the perovskite structure (from quasi-2D to 2D or from 2D to 1D) can enhance gabs by introducing greater asymmetry and helicity into the perovskite crystal structure.35\u201337 Even perovskites which demonstrate poor gabs can generate considerable gph, for example naphthylethylamine based quasi-2D perovskite (gabs = 5.0 10 3, gph = 0.15, see Fig. 4a).37 A number of mechanisms have been proposed for this enhancement, such as the direct excitation of spin-polarised electrons by CPL in perovskites and the spin-selective transport of these carriers in the perovskite due to large Rashba splitting.38\u201340"

The photocurrent generated in heterojunction photodiodes is limited by the exciton diffusion length of the active layer, which is typically low in organic semiconductors (B10 nm). As such, a compromise exists between strong light absorption and efficient exciton harvesting. This has resulted in the development of various photodiode architectures, including bilayer devices, interpenetrating donor-acceptor networks (bulk heterojunctions), and tandem devices.41 Note that, excluding gain mechanisms such as photon downconversion, the EQE of photodiodes is restricted to 100%.42\nIn 2019 Kim et al demonstrated heterojunction CP OPDs with photocurrent dissymmetry (gPh) B 0.1 by blending achiral polymer, P3CT, with a chiral small molecule additive, 1,10- binaphthyl (see Fig. 1 and 4b).43 Appropriate thin film processing caused the chiral small molecule to phase separate from the blend, and chirality transfer from the chiral additive to the polymer\u2013molecule hetero-aggregates gave rise to strong CP absorption: a self-organised, circularly selective heterojunction.

Large LDR can be achieved by suppressing noise current (reducing Imin) and is desirable for machine vision applications where images may contain both intense bright spots and low light regions which must be accurately measured. Our achiral polyfluorenebased (co-)polymer: chiral small molecule (1-aza[6]helicene) photodiodes achieve an LDR of B80 decibels, which is considerably higher than that of InGaAs (B66 dB) and rivals both silicon (120 dB) and non-chiral OPDs (B100 dB).30,69"

            "text": "The response speed of a photodetector quantifies the time taken for the photocurrent of a photodetector to change in response to variations in incident light intensity. This establishes a limit on the speed of optical phenomena which can be detected by a given photodetector and the rate of data transfer in an optical communication system. Response speed can be quantified by measuring the bandwidth (B) or the rise and fall times (tr and tf, respectively) of the photodetector.\nThe bandwidth (Fig. 5) measures how quickly a photodetector responds to light and is determined by the carrier transit time and the characteristic RC time of the device. Carrier transit time is determined by the length of the path that carriers must take to be extracted from a photodetector active layer and the strength of the electric field applied to increase the extraction rate. Parameters controlling the RC time of the\ndevice are device specific, however, any change to the device structure which reduces its total series resistance (e.g. reducing the distance between electrodes, reducing device contact resistance, the use of a higher mobility active layer and the use of lower sheet resistance contacts) or reduces the capacitance of the device (e.g. reducing the electrode area and reducing the photoactive area of the device) will reduce the characteristic RC time. In general, devices that exploit photoconductive gain have slower response times, which limits data transfer rates in optical communication systems. Whilst video applications require B 4 10 kHz, frequencies from 100 GHz to THz are particularly promising for next-generation communications because of unused bands of the spectrum, and are essential for technological applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous driving, and augmented reality.70\nThe rise time (tr) is the time taken for the device response to rise from 10% to 90% of its maximum value and the fall time (tf) is the time taken for the device response to fall from 90% to 10% of its maximum value (see Fig. 5).10,36 In dynamic imaging applications, a fast response time is essential to eliminate lag and enable fast imaging. To reliably measure pulsed signals without distortion, photodetectors require response times that are considerably faster than the pulse width to be measured. The response times depend how efficiently the photodetectors extract photogenerated charge carriers and can be improved through the judicious choice of electrodes and charge transport layers.\nTo date, the fastest organic CP selective photodetectors are our own photodiodes based on chiral small molecule (1-aza[6]helicene) \u2013 achiral polymer (F8T2) blends, with a bandwidth of 56 kHz (see Fig. 1).30 While suitable for imaging applications, which require frame rates of approximately 100 Hz, this bandwidth falls short of the bandwidth of InGaAs detectors used in fibre optic communications, with bandwidths in the 10 GHz range and rise times of the order of picoseconds.10,71 The low trap density and high charge carrier mobility of hybrid perovskite materials afford them both high LDR and ultrafast response times. Recently, response times of o10 ns have been reported in non-chiral perovskite/organic bulk heterojunction photodetectors based on MAPbI3 and F8IC (see Fig. 1).72 The fast response time is attributed to (i) the high hole mobility of MAPbI3, (ii) the high electron mobility of F8IC and (iii) the suppression of RC delay times due to the reduced active area of these devices (and therefore reduced device capacitance, C). The use of chiral active layers with high charge carrier mobilities and devices with small active areas should be further explored to increase the speed of CP selective detectors to be compatible with communication applications."

The photodetector is illuminated using a square wave modulated light source with a tuneable switching frequency. The frequency of modulation should be selected so that the device under test produces an oscilloscope signal of the form shown in Fig. 5a, with the device reaching an equilibrium voltage when the light source is in both the on and off states. Most oscilloscopes have built-in functions for extracting the average tr and tf once a signal of this form is acquired. tr and tf should not be extracted using the current measurement of a digital source measure unit, as the measurement sampling frequency is often inadequate for accurate measurements of response times below 10 ms.\nIn the measurement of B, tr and tf, it is essential that the light source, modulation source, current preamplifier and oscilloscope have electrical bandwidths greater than the bandwidth of the photodetector under test, otherwise the lowest bandwidth component of the testing apparatus will be measured instead of the true bandwidth or response times of the device.

To standardise this measurement, we suggest a similar approach to that taken by Kielar et al. and Wang et al., defining the operational lifetime as the time required for the responsivity or photocurrent dissymmetry factor of a device to fall to 80% of their post-burn-in values, whichever comes first.76,77\nTo measure responsivity and gph as a function of device operation time, we propose that the operational lifetime of a device should be measured under pulsed CP illumination, alternating between L-CP illumination, dark conditions, R-CP illumination, and dark conditions repeatedly. This can be achieved using the setup shown in Fig. 8. To avoid artificially inflating the device operational lifetime, device testing conditions (intensity, wavelength, and photodetector bias) should match those conditions required for the maximum photocurrent dissymmetry reported in the study.\nDark current and noise current\nThe Idark of a photodetector is measured as simply the current flow through the photodetector under dark conditions.\nThe NEP of a photodetector can be determined by measuring the voltage output of a current preamplifier connected to the device under test in dark conditions using a lock-in amplifier. Most modern digital lock-in amplifiers can provide the noise spectral density of the input signal which, when divided by the responsivity of the detector at a given wavelength, yields the noise equivalent power at that wavelength. This can, in turn, be used to calculate the device detectivity using eqn (16)."

The diversity of accessible chiral functional materials that absorb circularly polarised light introduces a wide range of new possibilities, which has inspired considerable research interest in both academia and industry. Whilst reported devices often show impressive chiroptical responses, their device performances are often inferior when compared to non-chiral photodetectors. Further, complete and rigorous characterisation of the critical photodetector parameters (e.g., linear dynamic range, bandwidth, detectivity) is rarely provided, which limits their application in real-world devices. In this tutorial review we have summarised the most important figures of merit for circularly polarised organic photodetectors and provided detailed descriptions of how to measure them.\nInnovations in molecular design, novel device architectures and stronger collaborations between materials chemists and device physicists will advance the field. Optical sensing from the ultraviolet to the infrared is essential for a variety of industrial and scientific applications. To this end, chiral\nfunctional materials with photoresponses that span the full range from the UV to the NIR will likely show promise. Chiral materials with outstanding electronic properties (e.g., minimal defects, a low trap density and high charge carrier mobilities) are essential for high-performance devices. Here, chiral organic\u2013inorganic systems (e.g., perovskites) and supramolecular assemblies are the most attractive candidates. Finally, exciton dissociation and the efficient extraction of charge carriers will require the use of multi-layer devices and optimised heterojunction structures with intermixed donor and acceptor domains.\nWe hope that this review will help to advance this exciting and growing field and inform the design of novel materials/ devices with outstanding chiroptical properties and device performance."
