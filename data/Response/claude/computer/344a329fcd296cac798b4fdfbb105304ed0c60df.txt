 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate other self-supervised learning methods besides SimCLR as the feature extractor in DeepVAT. Contrastive learning is a rapidly evolving field with new methods being proposed. Testing different self-supervised techniques could lead to further improvements.

2. Explore semi-supervised deep learning models like MixMatch as the feature extractor instead of purely unsupervised models. Having access to even a small subset of labeled data may boost DeepVAT's performance on complex image datasets. 

3. Evaluate DeepVAT on a wider range of complex image datasets beyond CIFAR-10 and Intel to better understand its capabilities and limitations. Testing on very high-resolution images, medical images, etc. would be informative.

4. Develop a dynamic version of DeepVAT that can incrementally update its cluster structure assessment as new unlabeled data arrives over time. This could be useful for monitoring cluster evolution in non-stationary data streams.

5. Investigate how DeepVAT could be extended to assess hierarchical clustering structures rather than just flat clustering. Modifying the algorithm to identify hierarchical relationships could broaden DeepVAT's applicability.
