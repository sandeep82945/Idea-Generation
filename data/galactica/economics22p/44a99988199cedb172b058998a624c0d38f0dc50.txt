conclusions In conclusion, the onset of physical disability was associated with statistically significantly higher out of pocket costs, and costs among females were higher than males, after adjustment for baseline sociodemographic characteristics. This study provides a better understanding of how the onset of physical disability or dementia affects economic wellbeing and out of pocket expenditure in older adults by stratifying types of health conditions and
differentiating by gender. It also highlights that classifying different types of health conditions to identify the drivers of out of pocket medical spending and to explore the gender differences in a long-term follow-up is of importance to examine the financial impact on the older population.
