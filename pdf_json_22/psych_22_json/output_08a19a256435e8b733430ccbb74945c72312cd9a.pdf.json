            "text": "Social status and hierarchy are core elements of social life and coordinate the dynamics between social groups (Fiske, 2010; Magee & Galinsky, 2008; Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Those at the top of the hierarchy relish a number of privileges, such as acting at will and producing intended effects (Dahl, 1957; Ellis, 1994; Marmot, 2004; Podolny, 2005; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959; Weber, 1946; Westphal & Zajac, 1995), which prompt them to behave more unethically (Boles et al., 2000; Gruenfeld et al., 2008; Kipnis, 1972; Lammers et al., 2010; Pitesa & Thau, 2013). Subsequently, high (as opposed to low) status offenders are punished harsher because they are viewed as more self- concerned than other- concerned (Bowles & Gelfand, 2010; Fragale et al., 2009; Fousiani & Van Prooijen 2022a, 2022b; Graffin et al., 2013; Karelaia & Keck, 2013; Polman et al., 2013). However, status is not a unidimensional construct; indeed, the literature distinguishes between the two main facets of status: power (i.e. access to valued resources) vs. prestige (respect and esteem that one has in the eyes of an observer) (Blader & Chen, 2012; Blau, 1964; Fiske, 2010; Kakkar et al., 2020). Despite their many commonalities, there are important conceptual differences between power and prestige, and the two constructs are often perceived differently by third party observers (Blader & Chen, 2012). For instance, recent research suggests that people punish harsher offenders whose position is defined by power as opposed to prestige because those offenders are seen as more intentional (Kakkar et al., 2020).\nYet, no study has so far investigated how power vs. prestige of an offender shapes the motives with which third party observers seek punishment. Such motives are people's justifications when assigning punishments, and therefore they have predictive value as they determine how observers eventually treat offenders (Carlsmith et al., 2002). In other words, whether or not observers punish an offender and how harshly they treat them largely depends on their underlying motives. Besides punishing offenders to pay them for their actions (e.g. give them their just deserts; Carlsmith et al., 2002; Goldberg et al., 1999; Kant, 1797; Van Prooijen, 2018; Wenzel & Thielmann, 2006), people may punish an offender to incapacitate them and protect society, or help them restore their relationship with victims and reintegrate into society (incapacitative versus restorative motives). Incapacitative motives are instrumental and seek to protect society by restraining offenders such that they cannot commit more harm (Carlsmith & Darley, 2008; Kahane et al., 2018; Van Prooijen, 2018). Restorative motives (de Beaumont & Tocqueville, 1833; Saleilles, 1898) seek to help offenders learn from their mistakes, improve their behaviour, and eventually reintegrate them into society (Zehr, 1997). How offenders\u2019 power or prestige influences observers\u2019 punishing motives is yet unknown, however. In the present paper, we investigated people's underlying motives for punishing powerful vs. prestigious offenders, and hypothesized stronger incapacitative motives for punishing a powerful offender yet stronger restorative motives for punishing a prestigious offender. Moreover, we investigate whether these effects are particularly pronounced when the offender is an ingroup (as opposed to outgroup) member.\nStatus as power versus prestige\nPeople punish high status offenders more harshly as compared to low status ones (Abrams et al., 2014; Hoyt et al., 2013; Kellerman, 2004) because those offenders can influence lay people's welfare to a greater extent and cause more harm (Fousiani & Van Prooijen 2022a, 2022b; Gruenfeld et al., 2008; Kipnis, 1972; Lammers et al., 2010). However, another line of research reveals opposite effects: High status offenders are treated more leniently by third party observers, as compared to their low status counterparts (e.g. Abrams et al., 2008, 2018), as people identify more strongly with high status offenders and see their immoralities in a less negative light (Cialdini et al., 1976). How can we reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings?\nIt is noteworthy that the literature identifies two forms of social status, namely power and prestige (see Blader & Chen, 2012; Blader et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2013; Kakkar et al., 2020). Power (or dominance)1 is defined as control over valued resources (Fiske, 2010) and as the ability to produce intended outcomes (Emerson, 1962). Powerful individuals are seen as assertive, controlling and dominant (Maner & Case, 2016), and as striving for gaining superiority and prevalence over others (Cheng et al., 2013, see also Laustsen & Petersen, 2015; Van Vugt, 2006). In contrast, prestige is defined as respect, esteem, recognition and admiration that an individual has in the eyes of an observer because of their personal qualities such as knowledge, expertise and skills (Anderson & Kilduff, 2009; Blader & Chen, 2012; Henrich & Gil- White, 2001; Maner & Case, 2016; Ridgeway & Erickson, 2000). Prestige has its origins externally as it refers to social worth that observers themselves attribute to an individual (Blau, 1964; Homans, 1961; Ridgeway & Erickson, 2000). Differently put, \u2018prestige is determined by the perceiver and, as such, necessarily lies in the eyes of the beholder\u2019 (Maner & Case, 2016: 138).\nKakkar et al. (2020) found that powerful (versus prestigious) offenders are punished more harshly, and hence suggest different effects of power versus prestige on third party punishment. Indeed, power is more closely related to the perception of an actor as immoral and intentional, triggering harsher punishment. In contrast, prestige prompts perceivers to give offenders the benefit of the doubt. People's motives for punishing powerful as opposed to prestigious offenders therefore might also vary. We assume that powerful offenders will elicit stronger incapacitative motives, as such offenders are viewed as more harmful and dangerous for society given their access to valued resources (Hypothesis 1a). Conversely, people are more willing to reinclude prestigious offenders into society, triggering stronger restorative motives (Hypothesis 1b).\nThe moderating role of group identity of an offender\nPrior research suggests that the affiliation of an offender plays a core role in people's justice- related decisions. Indeed, research on the \u2018black sheep effect\u2019 (BSE; Marques & Yzerbyt, 1988; Marques et al., 1988) shows that people treat ingroup offenders more negatively than outgroup offenders. More specifically, immoral- doing triggers harsher reactions towards ingroup than outgroup offenders, because ingroup offenders threaten the reputation of the group (Brambilla et al., 2013; Pagliaro et al., 2013), social cohesion (Tyler, 1997; Vidmar, 2000) and group values (Okimoto & Wenzel, 2010; Rullo et al., 2015; Sankaran et al., 2017; Van der Toorn et al., 2015). Consistent with this theorizing, Fousiani et al. (2019) found that observers have stronger incapacitative than restorative or retributive punishment motives towards ingroup as opposed to outgroup offenders. Incapacitative punishment motives aim to send a symbolic message by excluding the offender, thus condemning the offender's actions and publicly validating group values.\nBased on the above theorizing, we hypothesize that the effect of status (power vs. prestige) on motives for punishment will vary as a function of an offender's group identity. Immorality enacted by powerful ingroup offenders should be considered as a particularly strong threat to one's group identity, given their capacity to abuse their power towards other group members, exploit valued group resources, and cause harm to the group. We therefore predicted stronger incapacitative motives for punishing a powerful as opposed to prestigious offender especially when that offender comes from the ingroup (see also Brambilla et al., 2013; Pagliaro et al., 2013) (Hypothesis 2a). In contrast, a prestigious (as opposed to powerful) ingroup offender will trigger stronger restorative motives for punishment (Hypothesis 2b), as such an offender is viewed less negatively, and has less control over resources to enable power abuse.\n1The literature uses the terms \u2018power\u2019 (see Blader & Chen, 2012) and \u2018dominance\u2019 (see Kakkar et al., 2020) interchangeably when referring to individuals who are seen as controlling, assertive and striving for superiority through their ability to control resources and withhold them. In fact, the term power is more commonly used in social psychology research, whereas the term dominance is more commonly used in personality psychology and the evolutionary psychology literature (see Cheng et al., 2013 for this distinction). In the current work, we use the term power instead of dominance, although dominance could have been used instead."

Although not a core hypothesis, in Studies 1 and 2, we also added a control condition (power vs. prestige vs. control) to investigate possible differences in people's punishing preferences when no information about an offender's status is available. To further disentangle the relationship between power and prestige, Study 3 manipulated status separately (high vs. low power and high vs. low prestige; cf. Blader & Chen, 2012), and investigated the mediating role of group threat and perceived harm capacity of the offender in these relationships. The offenses focussed on sexual harassment (Study 1) and football vandalism (Studies 2 and 3). Besides punishment motives, Studies 2 and 3 also assessed observers\u2019 punishment intent.2 Moreover, since powerful people are often seen as more capable of causing serious harm given their extensive resource control (Fiske, 1993) in all three studies, we controlled for the perceived severity of harm3. Studies 1 and 2 also manipulated group identity (ingroup vs. outgroup), while in Study 3 we kept group identity constant.\nSTUDY 1"

Of the participants, 73.4% were working as employees or managers, 12.4% were students, and 7.8% were unemployed. Moreover, 13.7% had finished high school and 73.9% had higher education. Of the participants, 6.3% did not indicate their occupation or education. An a priori power analysis revealed that 400 participants were required to achieve 95% power to detect an interaction with a medium effect size of f = .25.\nExperimental design and procedure\nGraduate students recruited respondents using their social network and work connections. Participants were invited via social media (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter) to take part in this online study. Participation lasted about 8\u2013 10 minutes and was not paid. We manipulated the offender's status in vignettes similar to Blader and Chen (2012). Participants read a scenario presenting the offender (\u2018Mr X.\u2019) as a powerful division manager in a large company having control over an unusually large amount of resources (power condition) vs. a prestigious person in a large company who had acquired a very positive reputation in his division (prestige condition) vs. a person working in a very large company (control condition) (see Appendix S1 for the complete vignettes). As manipulation checks, participants then answered the following questions (1 = not at all, 7 = to a great extent): \u2018Mr. X. has control over a lot of resources in his division\u2019 (power manipulation check); \u2018Mr. X. is held in high regard in his division\u2019; \u2018Mr. X. is widely accepted by others in his division\u2019 (prestige manipulation check; Blader & Chen, 2012).\nSubsequently, we manipulated the offender's group identity. Participants imagined working together with Mr X. in the same division (ingroup) vs. working in a different division than Mr X.\u2019s (outgroup). As a manipulation check, participants indicated whether they were an employee in the same division with Mr. X ( yes / no). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the six experimental conditions.\n2In both studies we also included a 3- item willingness to punish scale. However, the items were mostly assessing retributive punishment motives, and therefore we decided to remove this scale from this manuscript.\n3Results in all three studies did not differ when the control variable (perceived severity of harm) was not included in the analyses.\nMeasures"

Moreover, in line with the BSE (Marques & Yzerbyt, 1988; Marques et al., 1988), this effect emerged only when the offender was an ingroup member. These findings support Hypotheses 1a and 2a, and are consistent with the underlying argument that people display stronger exclusionary reactions to powerful as opposed to prestigious ingroup offenders because such offenders have a higher potential to cause harm to the group (Thomas & Cage, 1976; Thomas & Foster, 1975). Status and group identity did not influence restorative motives, however, and therefore Hypotheses 1b and 2b were not supported.\nA limitation of Study 1 is that the design may have varied differences in self- relevance: Particularly in the powerful ingroup offender condition, participants might have seen themselves as directly impacted by the offender's act. After all, a powerful ingroup offender is more likely to sexually harass another ingroup member. This limitation is addressed in Study 2, which focusses on football hooliganism. Moreover, Study 2 includes an additional measure: punishment intent. Although Kakkar et al. (2020) have already demonstrated people's harsher reaction to powerful as opposed to prestigious offenders, they have not investigated the moderating role of an offender's group identity in this relationship. We hypothesize that observers will display a stronger intention to punish a powerful as opposed to prestigious offender, especially when that offender comes from the ingroup (rather than an outgroup) (Hypothesis 3).\nT A B L E 2 Means and standard deviations for the study variables across experimental conditions (Study 1)\nPowerIngroup\nPrestigeIngroup\nControlIngroup\nPowerOutgroup\nPrestigeOutgroup\nControlOutgroup\nM SD M SD M SD M SD M SD M SD\nIncapacitative motives\n5.54 1.38 4.75 1.72 5.31 1.52 4.96 1.71 5.01 1.61 4.75 5.02\nRetributive motives\n5.72 1.00 5.54 1.25 5.86 1.54 5.78 1.11 5.80 1.02 5.70 .94\nRestorative motives\n5.44 1.24 5.48 1.37 5.33 1.30 5.34 1.42 5.30 1.44 5.66 1.17\nNote: All ratings were on 7- point scales ranging from 1 = absolutely disagree to 7 = absolutely agree.\nSTUDY 2"

Finally, people indicated a stronger intention to punish powerful ingroup as opposed to prestigious ingroup offenders, supporting Hypothesis 3.\nSTUDY 3\nIn Study 3, we expanded on the previous studies by separately manipulating power and prestige, given that power and prestige are distinct dimensions of status (Blader & Chen, 2012). Furthermore, Study 3 held group membership of the offender constant (i.e. ingroup), and examined the underlying mechanisms that drive the effects of power and prestige on punishment motives.

Prior research has found that ingroup threat (i.e. a danger to the in- group's well- being and reputation; Stephan et al., 2002) mediates the relationship between immoral doing and incapacitative motives (Fousiani et al., 2019). In Study 3, we therefore hypothesize that a high (as opposed to low) power offender will trigger higher punishment intent and stronger incapacitative motives (Hypothesis 4a) through increased ingroup threat (Hypothesis 4b). In contrast, a high prestige (as opposed to low prestige) offender, who is held in high regard, will trigger lower punishment intent and stronger restorative punishment motives (Hypothesis 5a) through decreased ingroup threat (Hypothesis 5b).\nAs additional mediator, we considered the offender's capacity to harm the ingroup. Indeed, a high power offender is most able to harm the group given their capacity to abuse group resources (see Fiske, 1993). However, this is not the case for prestigious offenders who do not necessarily control group resources. Accordingly, we hypothesized that increased harm capacity will mediate the positive effects of high (as opposed to low) power on punishment intent and incapacitative motives (Hypothesis 6a), whereas decreased harm capacity will mediate the negative effect of high (as opposed to low) prestige offender on punishment intent and the positive effect on restorative motives (Hypothesis 6b). The study was preregistered (https://osf.io/68vh4/ ?view_only=d6863 63ca4 4b43e 1a1e9 92787 3c8ad9c).\nAs recent research (Fousiani & Van Prooijen 2022a, 2022b) found that power of a suspect of immoraldoing has no influence on retributive motives for punishment, we did not measure retributive motives in Study 3."

            "text": "Previous research revealed that people recommend more severe punishments for offenders who are at the top of the hierarchy (Fragale et al., 2009; Fousiani & Van Prooijen 2022a, 2022b; Karelaia & Keck, 2013) because such offenders are perceived as more capable of doing harm (Blader & Yap, 2016; Boles et al., 2000; Fragale et al., 2009; Galinsky et al., 2015; Lammers et al., 2015). However, high status offenders can be distinguished as powerful (or dominant) versus prestigious (Blader & Chen, 2012; Blader et al., 2016). Kakkar et al. (2020) showed that people treat powerful as opposed to prestigious offenders more harshly, as the former are seen as more intentional and less moral. What is less known, however, is observers\u2019 underlying motives for punishing powerful vs. prestigious offenders, which drive people's justice- related decisions. The present study was designed to investigate the motives for which people punish powerful vs. prestigious offenders. Furthermore, we examined the moderating role of an offender's group identity (ingroup vs. outgroup) in these relationships and the mediating mechanisms underlying these effects.\nThe results of Studies 1 and 2 suggest that observers have stronger incapacitate motives towards powerful than prestigious offenders, and this effect emerges particularly for ingroup offenders. A similar moderating effect of group identity emerges for the effect of status on punitive intent, expanding prior research (Kakkar et al., 2020). These findings are in line with the BSE theory (Marques & Yzerbyt, 1988; Marques et al., 1988) and suggest that when ingroup offenders have access to resources, they are particularly dangerous for the group and therefore incapacitated. Furthermore, Study 2 (but not Study 1) showed that people display stronger restorative motives towards prestigious as opposed to powerful offenders, suggesting that people are more willing to offer prestigious offenders an opportunity to make up for their wrong- doings and reintegrate to the group.

Preregistered Study 3 manipulated power and prestige to investigate their separable effects on punishment motives. Results revealed that people display stronger incapacitative motives and punitive intent towards high versus low power offenders. Moreover, ingroup identity threat and perceived harm capacity of the offender mediated this effect. Contrary to our predictions, however, prestige had no effect on restorative motives in Study 3.\nThe effects of status on incapacitative punishment motives, as well as the moderating effect of an offender's group identity, were consistent across Studies 1 and 2. Importantly, Study 3 replicated these findings through a different experimental design. This indicates that the effects of power on incapacitative punishing motives are robust, suggesting that observers experience the acts of powerful offenders as a bigger threat than the acts of prestigious offenders. The effects of prestige on restorative motives for punishment were only found in Study 2 but not in Studies 1 and 3. We therefore regard the main effects of prestige on punitive motives as inconclusive at this point. Also, prestige did not interact with group identity on restorative motives in Studies 1 and 2. One possible explanation for this is that observers might identify strongly with prestigious offenders no matter what their group identity is (ingroup or outgroup). In other words, as soon as one holds a person in high esteem, one might easily connect their own identity to that person and, for instance, focus on overarching categorizations (e.g. member of the same company, even when in different divisions). Another possible explanation is that the links between prestige, group identity and punishment motives depend on group identification (Leach et al., 2008). For instance, observers might be willing to reintegrate a prestigious ingroup offender only when they strongly identify with the group. Future research may further investigate the effect of prestige on motives for punishment."

            "text": "This research has important practical implications. First, our findings are particularly relevant for relatively hierarchical organizations. HR practitioners should be aware of the differential role that status as power vs. prestige plays in order to achieve fair outcomes when immoralities are enacted. More specifically, our findings hold implications for leader\u2013 follower relationships where leaders, depending on whether they are predominantly viewed as powerful or prestigious, might evoke differential reactions among followers when breaking the rules. The current findings suggest that followers are negatively predisposed towards a leader on whom they are dependent for gaining access to resources, and thus react more negatively to them when they commit an offense; but they are more likely to excuse an offense of a leader who is held in high regard and is admired.\nSecond, our findings inform legal decision makers of potential biases when high status harm- doers are involved. Quite regularly people in high- rank positions are accused of criminal behaviours (e.g. money- laundering, tax evasion, etc.). Information about a suspect's access to resources may shape to what extent they are perceived as threatening to society, influencing punitive decisions about them. The current findings also have broader implications for society, as they suggest that people's punishment motives serve to protect ingroup rather than outgroup members. The present findings may raise awareness among governmental institutions of this bias, facilitating interventions to promote fair treatment of offenders independent from their group identity. Finally, this study underscores the role of underlying motives in punishment. Although behavioural punishment is easily observed and assessed, punitive motives justify and shape such punishment decisions (Carlsmith et al., 2002). Therefore, punitive motives deserve more attention in future research."

Moreover, we manipulated offender's group identity in different contexts (i.e. a corporate setting in Study 1 and a football team in Studies 2). In both studies, group identity of the offender interacted with status in predicting incapacitative motives revealing the robustness of this effect. The findings also replicated across samples drawn from two different cultures (Greece, a collectivistic country and United Kingdom, an individualistic country, Hofstede et al., 2010). Finally, Study 3 identified two underlying mechanisms by showing that ingroup threat and perceived harm capacity mediate the effects of power on incapacitative motives.\nThis study includes a number of limitations as well. For instance, we focussed on observer's punitive motives, and did not assess behavioural punishment measures. Moreover, we manipulated the offense through hypothetical vignettes. These considerations suggest that there are ample opportunities to further investigate the effects observed here through field studies and lab experiments, to gain a better understanding of how status influences punitive motives and behaviours towards offenders across social settings."

The primary conclusion is that people have different motives to punish powerful versus prestigious offenders. People are more likely to indicate instrumental (i.e. utilitarian; see Bentham, 1789) decisionmaking when faced with offenders who have access to resources, by seeking to incapacitate them. This is the case especially when offenders are ingroup rather than outgroup members. The evidence that people hold a preference for restorative punishing practices towards prestigious offenders is suggestive but not conclusive.
