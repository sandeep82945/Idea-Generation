    "abstractText": "Rural tourism development has been an essential driving force behind China\u2019s promotion of integrated urban\u2013rural development, sustainable rural development and rural revitalization in the new era. This study included 1470 villages on the national list of beautiful leisure villages in China (BLVCs) from 2010 to 2021. We explored the distribution characteristics and influencing factors based on mathematical statistics and spatial analysis in ArcGIS to provide a theoretical reference for promoting the development of leisure village agriculture and rural tourism. The results show that the distribution of BLVC presents a clustered state, showing a distribution pattern of a dual core, seven centers and multiple scattered points. BLVCs are mainly distributed in areas with flat terrain and sufficient water resources, which are conducive to agricultural production and life. Having convenient transportation and rich tourism resources aids the promotion of rural tourism development. The resulting gap in regional development is balanced to some extent by government support. The research results provide a reference value for future rural spatial optimization and sustainable development. This paper summarizes the law of rural development and clarifies the factors influencing the development of rural tourism, and it provides the Chinese experience as a model for a rural renaissance empowered by rural tourism.",

            "text": "The beautiful leisure village is a rural development model that closely combines rural leisure tourism and rural ecological construction. It is one of the fundamental ways to boost rural revitalization and development in China. Since the Industrial Revolution, with the continuous advancement of the urbanization process, the imbalance between urban and rural development has been a common problem faced by human settlement environments around the world [1,2]. It directly affects national economies and people\u2019s livelihoods, resulting in declining rural areas and agriculture, along with urban environmental problems [3,4]. For this reason, developed countries abroad such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and the United States have carried out a long-term and localized exploration of rural rejuvenation [5\u20137]. China is one of the most populous countries globally and has experienced rapid urbanization, with around 690,000 administrative villages and the rural population accounting for about 36.1% of the country\u2019s total population [8\u201310]. Approximately 6.7% of the population worldwide lives in China\u2019s rural areas, and this vast number cannot be ignored. Since the 21st century, China has successively implemented macro strategies such as coordinating urban and rural development, new rural construction, urban\u2013rural integration and new urbanization [11,12]. In the 2013 national policy document, the goal of building beautiful villages was proposed for the first time [13]. The construction of the leisure village can be seen as a further exploration of and primary\nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2022, 11, 455. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi11080455 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi\nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2022, 11, 455 2 of 25\nbreakthrough in leisure tourism [14]. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China carried out a nationwide identification. The brand construction of beautiful leisure villages in China (BLVCs) has great significance and an important role in promoting the integration of rural primary, secondary and tertiary industries and enabling rural economic development [15,16]. Against the background of China\u2019s development in the new era, the rural revitalization strategy proposal at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China 2017 (the highest level of meetings of the Chinese Communist Government) also brought new aid and opportunities to the construction of beautiful leisure villages [17]. Since the end of 2019, the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has changed people\u2019s inherent way of life, with more attention being paid to health and the environment [18,19]. Compared with the crowded urban environment and complex inhabitants, the relatively stable rural living population, broad spaces and self-sufficient sustainable food guarantee a healthy rural life [20]. This global epidemic has objectively promoted a population return and tourism boom in rural areas [21]. Therefore, as an important engine to promote rural revitalization, industrial prosperity and farmers\u2019 income, leisure agriculture and rural tourism have become the new research topics [22,23]. Previous studies have mainly tended to focus on the sustainable development of rural tourism, rural land use and resource evaluation, the exploration of the tourism development mode, etc. The research methods have mainly been a combination of qualitative and quantitative [24\u201327]. International scholars have conducted many studies on the development mode and impact effect of rural tourism, and they all agree that the development of rural tourism has a positive impact on rural economies. Scholars have also carried out early research in the field of tourism spatial structures. The research methods have ranged from the early application of location theory to theoretical basic research and then to empirical research on tourism destinations [28,29]. Research on the factors influencing rural settlements has gradually developed from natural factors to comprehensive factors such as nature, the economy and society [30]. With the development of rural areas in developed countries, increasingly more research is being focused on the social and humanistic fields and the impact of human beings. There is still a lack of quantitative research on the influencing factors. In light of the practical problems caused by unreasonable planning, excessive development and homogenization in domestic rapid rural construction, scholars have also carried out research and analysis of the spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors and combined it with ArcGIS technology to provide spatial analysis, data processing and other analysis support [31\u201333]. Most research has focused on traditional villages, rural settlement spaces and key rural tourism villages in provinces, cities, counties and specific areas [34\u201336]. There are fewer macroscopic analyses at the national level. Meanwhile, most of the existing studies have taken the National Key Villages for Rural Tourism list as the research object, a list that was only proposed three years ago. The number of selected villages varies each year greatly [37,38]. Therefore, this list relatively lacks maturity of the selection criteria. A limited number of scholars has taken the whole of BLVCs as the research object. However, the research time period is earlier, there is a lack of recent list updates, the amount of data is small, and the analysis of the factors affecting the distribution of rural leisure points also needs to be more in depth. In China, provincial and municipal organizations have published many similar rural development lists [39,40]. As the most authoritative government agency currently coordinating China\u2019s rural revitalization strategy, the list released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China is a direct implementation of the central government document\u2019s spirit [41]. Based on this situation, this study obtained the BLVC list from 2010 to 2021 and carried out data cleaning on it. A total of 1470 villages listed within 12 years were studied and analyzed quantitatively, using ArcGIS software as the research tool. From the national perspective, this study analyzed 12 batches of beautiful leisure villages nationwide. We updated and revealed the spatial distribution characteristics of BLVCs, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis of the influencing factors. This paper summarizes the law of rural development and provides scientific methods for further integrating development\nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2022, 11, 455 3 of 25\nelements and optimizing spatial patterns in rural areas. Furthermore, through the practical application of rural tourism development, we show the clear advantages and positive role that it has. This study provides a reference and quantitative scientific basis for the overall future development and planning of leisure villages. It is expected to inject a new impetus into rural revitalization in China and provide the Chinese experience as an example for rural revitalization in other countries."

Kernel Density Estimation\nKernel density estimation is a nonparametric method for estimating the probability density function. It was used to study the morphology and change in the spatial distribution density of point elements in the region, reflecting the dispersion and aggregation characteristics of the BLVCs in this study [44]. Its formula is as follows:\nfn(x) = 1\nnh\nn\n\u2211 i=1\nk (\nx\u2212 Xi h\n) (3)\nwhere fn(x) represents the kernel density estimate of the BLVCs, n is the number of BLVCs, k (\nx\u2212Xi h ) denotes the kernel function, x\u2212 Xi stands for the distance between the estimated point x and the sample Xi, and h represents the bandwidth. The more significant kernel density estimates indicate a denser distribution of points.\n2.2.3. Imbalance Index\nThe imbalance index reflects the distribution of BLVCs in different areas. To show the difference in their spatial distribution, the Lorentz curve was applied to further analyze the equilibrium degree of the BLVCs [45,46] with the following formula:\nS = \u2211 n i=1 Yi \u2212 50(n + 1)\n100\u00d7 n\u2212 50(n + 1) (4)\nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2022, 11, 455 6 of 25\nwhere S represents the imbalance index, n is the number of administrative areas and Yi denotes the cumulative percentage of the ith region in the total amount in descending order. Given that 0 \u2264 S \u2264 1: S = 0 indicates that the BLVCs are evenly distributed in all areas, S = 1 implies that the BLVCs are concentrated in one of the regions, and 0 < S < 1 indicates an unbalanced distribution in each region.\n2.2.4. Gini Coefficient\nThis study used the Gini coefficient to analyze the spatial structure layout of BLVCs in the discrete partition in order to judge the distribution balance degree in the geographical national partition [47]. Its formula is\nG = \u2212\u2211ni=1 PilnPi\nlnN (5)\nC = 1\u2212 G (6)\nIn Equation (5), G is the Gini coefficient, n represents the number of samples in the partition, Pi stands for the proportion of BLVCs in the ith geographical division to the national total and N indicates the number of partitions. In Equation (6), C represents the distribution uniformity. Theoretically, the Gini coefficient is between 0 and 1, and the larger the Gini coefficient, the higher the concentration.\n2.2.5. Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient\nThe influencing factors influence the spatial distribution of BLVCs. To explore the influence degree of various factors, this study used the correlation analysis method to reflect the interrelationship between the spatial distribution and the influencing factors of BLVCs [48], and its formula is\nr = \u2211 n i=1(xi \u2212 x)(yi \u2212 y)\u221a \u2211ni=1(xi \u2212 x) 2 \u221a \u2211ni=1(yi \u2212 y) 2\n(7)\nwhere x represents the number of BLVCs in various administrative regions, y is the influencing factor of the spatial distribution and r denotes the correlation coefficient. Given that \u20131 \u2264 r \u2264 1, r > 0 implies that the spatial distribution is positively correlated with the influencing factors, and the larger the correlation coefficient, the stronger the correlation. When r < 0, this implies that the spatial distribution is negatively correlated with the influencing factors."

In the yearly continuation and adjustment of the standards, the BLVC selection system has become more complete, covering more diverse villages. The list is updated every year. By 2021, a total of 1470 projects had been released in 12 batches, forming a nationwide brand network of BLVCs representing the rural tourism destinations that people yearn for [50]. After sorting and conducting a statistical analysis of the list, it was found that these villages are scattered and centrally distributed in 31 administrative regions (Table 1), which account for 91.18% of the administrative regions. Zhejiang province has a total of 72 BLVCs, the most significant number (accounting for 4.90% of the national total), while the smallest number is in the Ningxia region, with a total of 22 villages accounting for 1.50% of the national total. Overall, the distribution in most provinces is relatively balanced with a large quantity gap in some parts.\nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2022, 11, 455 7 of 25\nIn the past 12 years and 12 batches, the annual number of BLVCs has gradually increased. According to the selection number and definition criteria changes, there have been three development stages:\n(1) From 2010 to 2013, in the early stage of development, 10 villages were selected every year, and the number of areas and villages involved in the list remained unchanged. Within 4 years, the selection involved 22 provinces and administrative regions. The initial criteria definition was less dimensional, mainly focusing on external conditions such as complete management and facilities. In 2007, the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to \u201ccoordinate urban and rural development and promote the construction of a new socialist countryside\u201d [51]. In 2008, Anji County in Zhejiang province formally proposed the \u201cChinese Beautiful Village\u201d plan, which promoted the development of rural construction in various areas [52]. (2) In 2014\u20132018, the number of defined villages increased in uniform growth in the middle of development. In 2013, national policy documents first proposed the goal of the new rural construction of \u201cbeautiful villages\u201d, promoting protection of the rural ecological environment and the village\u2019s appearance and gradually enriching the types of BLVCs [53]. After 2014, the defined number of BLVCs increased significantly compared with the initial stage and then gradually stabilized at 150 villages every\nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2022, 11, 455 8 of 25\nyear. In 2018, the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed the rural revitalization strategy, which became the guide for rural development in the new era [54].\n(3) From 2019 to 2021, the development of BLVCs also entered a new growth stage. Compared with 2018, the defined number increased by 110, nearly three times the growth rate of the second stage. The definition standard tended to improve, and more attention was paid to displaying the villages\u2019 advantages and characteristics.\nSince 2014, the connotation and type of BLVC have been gradually extended, and the list has been divided into four categories: characteristic residential villages, ancient villages, characteristic folk villages and modern new villages. This reflects the redefinition of BLVCs by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Beauty and leisure can include characteristic architecture, rich culture and unique folk customs, as well as new villages and their atmosphere, covering a wide range conducive to the development of village characteristics [55]. However, this classification does not cover all batches of the list, so the continuation of the classification and list definition standards resulted in the list of BLVCs being divided into four categories. There are differences in category distributions from regional distribution due to different geographical climates, economic development and population distribution (Figure 4). The villages featuring folk culture and local dwellings are predominant in terms of quantity. Village characteristics and lifestyles, unlike those of cities, have become the main attraction of rural leisure tourism [56]. Nevertheless, due to various reasons, such as development, natural disasters, backward economic development and lifestyle changes, the retention of ancient villages has proven to be quite difficult. Urbanization and the erosion of the village has led to most of the historically ancient villages being far from the economically developed urban centers, such as Guangxi, Yunnan, Fujian and Guizhou. However, modern new villages combine the overall needs of urban and rural people, are closer to developed cities such as Chongqing, Sichuan, Shanghai and Hebei and have relatively diversified forms and facilities. The modern new villages also encourage construction in a few remote and poor areas, such as Xinjiang, to balance the gap between urban and rural communities. ISPRS Int. J.

We used the ArcGIS 10.2 Average Nearest Neighbor tool to perform a nearest neighbor analysis of 1470 BLVCs. The average actual nearest distance was 28.514 km, and the theoretical nearest distance was 40.319 km (where A = 9,552,570 km2, excluding Hong\nISPRS Int. J.

As ri < rE, the two ratios were less than one, indicating that the spatial distribution of BLVCs is concentrated.\n3.2.2. Spatial Distribution Density\nThe overall distribution of BLVCs is a gathering trend. Through the kernel density estimation value, the spatial distribution density of BLVCs can be further defined in the region. It can be even more intuitively displayed on a map. The kernel density was estimated using the Density tool in ArcGIS 10.2. The calculated density values were divided into four categories using the natural breakpoint method: kernel density, high density, medium density and low density (Table 2). Finally, the spatial kernel density distribution map of BLVCs was generated (Figure 5). The spatial distribution density varied significantly in different regions. Compared with the northwest, the southeast has apparent aggregation. On the whole, a distribution pattern of \u201cdual core, seven centers and multiple scattered points\u201d appeared.\nISPRS Int.

This study overlaid the BLVCs with the national digital elevation data, dividing them into five elevation intervals according to the natural intermittent point method (Figure 7). On the whole, the villages are mainly distributed in the low-terrain plain and hilly areas. Furthermore, this was overlapped with the main river network (rivers above level 3) (Figure 7), with buffer analysis and statistical analysis conducted on vector data of the level 5 water system in China (Table 5). It was found that 75.50% of BLVCs are distributed around rivers, and the adjacent water distribution characteristics are apparent. According to the seven geographical divisions, further research found that the eastern region in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River has the largest number of villages.

Different levels of tourist attractions are the main brand representatives to measure China\u2019s regional tourism development. The efore, this study selected the number of domestic tourists and the number of A-level scenic spots reflecting tourism development for correlation analysis. Thus, the correlation coefficient r = 0.669, 0.769 shows that the distribution of BLVCs had a significant positive correlation with regional tourism development.

The spatial distribution of BLVCs is largely based on the local scenic r diation for achieving complementary resources and customer sharing. From the correlation analy is results of th ty es of BLVCs, the distribution of characteristic residential and historical ancient villages is significantly and positively related to tourism development. Most historical ancient villages are high-quality tourist attractions, with rich tourism resources such as historical culture attractions and traditional architecture. However, in the characteristic residential villages, the investment in and construction of rural homestays with residential features satisfies the sense of experience for many leisure tourists and promotes rural development. According to statistics from a 2021 report on China\u2019s tourism scenic spot development, the integration of scenic spots and homestays in rural tourism is becoming increasingly prominent, driving rural leisure tourism development. Therefore, regional tourism development is one of the critical factors affecting whether rural leisure tourism can achieve high-quality and sustainable development. Rich tourism resources, perfect tourism facilities, construction and tourism service system development around scenic spots provide customer source markets for developing beautiful local leisure rural tourism [77,78].

The number and types of villages in each geographical area are different and are related to the regional geographical environment, transportation, tourism development and policies (Figure 14). Compared with other research objects that are limited to a local or single batch list, this study conducted research on all batches of BLVC catalogs released to date, with larger amounts of data and more persuasive results. In terms of research methods, this study innovatively used Pearson\u2019s coefficient to quantitatively analyze and screen multiple factors, carrying out studies on specific cases for use as evidence. The quantitative analysis method combined with a qualitative summary means the research results are more scientific, with more exemplary significance for rural tourism development. The research is also relevant to current hotspots around the world and considers people\u2019s yearning for a healthy rural life and the advantages of low-density rural environments for living and traveling under the restrictions of COVID-19.

            "text": "This study conducted a spatial and mathematical-statistical analysis of 1470 villages on the list of BLVCs from 12 batches and conducted quantitative analysis of 4 aspects: spatial distribution patterns, densities, discrepancies and clusters (Table 7). The characteristics and patterns of their spatial distribution were summarized, and the following results were obtained.\n(1) By 2021, 1470 BLVCs had been selected in the 31 administrative regions of China. The distribution in each region is uneven, presenting a state of aggregation. (2) The distribution of BLVCs presents a double-core, seven-center, multiple scattered distribution pattern. (3) Most BLVCs are located in the southeast, with a clear difference in distribution between the two sides of the Hu line. (4) From the perspective of the seven geographical divisions, the distribution of BLVCs is the highest in the east and the lowest in the south, with a difference of 19.25%.\nTo explore the factors affecting the spatial distribution, this study screened the influencing factors through Pearson\u2019s coefficients on the basis of previous studies. Finally, the following aspects were analyzed:\n(1) From the perspective of the geographical environment, BLVCs are mainly concentrated in areas with flat terrain, a suitable climate and sufficient water resources, such as the eastern region. (2) From the perspective of road traffic, approximately half of the BLVCs are close to convenient road transportation. Accessibility affects the impact of rural development and the attraction of leisure tourism. (3) From the perspective of tourism development, the development of rich tourism resources and the construction of facilities and service systems have promoted the distribution and development of BLVCs.\nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2022, 11, 455 22 of 25\n(4) From the perspective of policy, to achieve a balanced development of BLVCs in all regions, the national and local governments have strengthened policy guidance and financial support, especially in the northwest inland areas with slow development, such as Xinjiang.\nThis study analyzed the uneven spatial pattern of BLVCs and their categories, and it deeply discussed the formation mechanism under the influence of four factors: geographical environment, transportation, tourism development and policy. This study provides a systematic research framework and methods for developing an understanding of rural development from the macro law to specific implementation, which is conducive to the more reasonable use of the resources and regional advantages of rural areas, and the research results are universal. The specific study of characteristic rural tourism has created a new impetus for rural revitalization to further guide village leisure agriculture and the sustainable development of rural tourism and even to promote rural revitalization. This study proposes the following suggestions:\n(1) Make full use of local ecological characteristics and resource advantages, and adjust the measures to the local conditions. Pay attention to improving rural ecological quality, maintaining rural scenery and respecting the natural patterns. (2) Build a tourism transportation network, comprehensively improve the integrity and diversity of tourism transportation facilities, and further enhance the attraction of tourism destinations. (3) The various regions should improve the facilities supporting rural tourism and comprehensively improve the service capacity and level of rural tourism. Each region should rely on their own cultural and tourism resources to develop the tourism industry creatively, integrating advantageous regional resources and enhancing the effect of industrial agglomeration. (4) The government should further improve rural policies and increase financial support for rural tourism. Local governments should confront the differences and gaps in regional development, strengthen coordinated development with the surrounding areas and form a win-win strategy of regional linkage and cooperation to optimize the spatial layout.\nAuthor Contributions: Jiazhen Zhang developed the research topic.
