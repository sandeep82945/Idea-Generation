    "abstractText": "The winding segmented permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (WS-PMLSM) has not only a general slotting effect but also a unique two-end effect caused by the segmented stator and the finite length passive mover, which makes the detent force of WS-PMLSM possess the qualities of all types of linear motors. This paper adopts a physics-based multiple analytical method to study the detent force properties. First, an accurate sub-domain model is used to obtain the magnetic field distribution of the tooth slot, and the results of the analytical solution and the graph of the tooth slot effect are obtained using the scalar magnetic potential. Subsequently, the effect of the end unenergized core on the magnetic field is analyzed using Maxwell\u2019s theory for the stator end effect, revealing that the end effect causes pulsating and reversing magnetic fields in the motor, which in turn creates mutual inductance with unequal phases, and generates thrust fluctuations. Finally, a complex relative air-gap permeability is introduced on the basis of the conformal mapping to equate the end effect generated by the permanent magnet. The accuracy of the proposed multiple analytical models was verified by the results of the finite element method (FEM) and experimental model.",

            "text": "An important application of winding segmented permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (WS-PMLSM) in modern industry is material handling and processing [1]. The main purpose is to reduce labor. A common form is made into a ring structure so that it can be recycled, and the transmission moving parts are called movers, which are passive and do not require any energy or information transfer. The track consists of segmented stators, equivalent to multiple motors connected in series, each stator being separately powered and controlled [2]. Figure 1 shows an example of an application in a battery-powered line, where multiple movers operate highly independently on the same track, with four stations (P1\u2013P4) distributed along the track at the desired locations [3]. Obviously, the detent force of WS-PMLSM is a problem in the processing area, and it also tends to cause workpiece loosening and running noise, which seriously affects the smoothness of the transfer system and is even more impermissible in the case of transferring liquids. This detent force is mainly caused by the slot effect and the longitudinal end effect [4]. The slot effect is more common and the corresponding literature is more abundant. This literature can be summarized into two methods; one is to improve the motor structure [5\u20138], and the other is to use special control methods [9\u201311]. However, compared to conventional linear motors, the WS-PMLSM generates two types of end effects, defined as secondary end effects and primary end effects, due to the limited length of the secondary module of the permanent magnet and the primary\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1049. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14051049 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nmodule of the winding, which increases the complexity of implementing thrust fluctuation suppression for such motors.\nThe secondary end effect is an important factor for the thrust fluctuation generated by WS-PMLSM, which is also a unique phenomenon of WS-PMLSM [12]. It is caused by the magnetic field of the permanent magnets at the secondary end, mainly in the form of the magnetic field of the secondary pole affecting the magnetic field distribution inside the motor through the magnetic field association of the adjacent poles. The primary end effect is related to the discontinuous distribution of the winding, similar to the commonly analyzed end effect in linear induction motors [13], but it is reflected in the change of electromagnetic parameters only when there is a current excitation in the winding, due to the abnormal magnetic field distribution at the end [14]. Due to the presence of closely connected cores outside the energized modules and the variation of magnetic fields, less of the literature has focused on this aspect. To effectively predict the detent forces due to end effects and slotting effects, different methods have been developed, which can be divided into four main categories: analytical, semi-analytical, numerical, and hybrid methods (a combination of all three) [15]. Numerical methods are very flexible for a wide range of geometries, including nonlinear and non-homogeneous materials, and can be combined with other physics. One of the more representative numerical methods is the FEM [16,17]; however, the high level of complexity in FEM leads to very time-consuming simulations that slow down the design process. Therefore, it seems necessary to develop a simple analytical model for the initial design that is very fast in computation and provides more physical insight. Several analytical methods have been proposed, such as the magnetic circuit method [18], the hierarchical model method [19], the integral transformation method [20], the field\u2013circuit coupled method [21], the air gap magnetic permeability method, the winding function method [22] and the Maxwell mathematical physics method [23]. Among all analytical techniques, a semi-analytical method called the subdomain model (SDM) has been developed that can calculate magnetic fields very accurately and much faster than numerical methods (e.g., FEM), making it a good method to study and deploy. The SDM approach is to simplify the motor model by dividing it into several regular domains in which the problem is linearized. Liu et al. [24] first introduced an accurate subdomain modeling approach for slot models with pole pair conversion. Guo and Hu [25] proposed a new analytical model for long dynamic magnetic linear motors, which uses a method that scales up the diameter of the rotating motor to a certain degree so as to approach the linear motor model, the results obtained from this analytical model depend on the choice of radius. An effective analytical model for PMLSM is presented in [26,27], which takes into account the end effects by adding virtual slots and slotting effects by using relative air-gap permeability. These methods try to solve all magnetic resistance problems of linear motors; however, the nonlinear magnetic field distribution at the end of WS-PMLSM requires the division of more subdomains. Therefore, in this paper, only the slotting effect is studied by using the mature SDM method, and the end effect is analyzed by other methods. In view of the limitations of SDM in the application of WS-PMLSM, it is necessary to integrate various magnetic field solution methods to analyze and study the end effect of\nWS-PMLSM magnetically. The Conformal Map Method (CM) [28] is a powerful analytical tool for determining two-dimensional magnetic fields. Using the CM method, a complex magnetic field structure can be transformed into a simpler linear magnetic field structure so that it is easier to solve the differential equations. For example, a special CM, called the Schwarz\u2013Christoffel (SC) mapping method [29], is used to determine end effects, but all of the literature is on linear-induced motors, and there is very little literature on linear motors where the secondary is a permanent magnet. For the end effect of WS-PMLSM with open core and segmented power supply, there is even less literature, generally using the direct table look-up method of current-flux linkage [30,31], FEM [32], etc. The WS-PMLSM has the process of moving through the stator armature segmentation [10] and also the pulsating air gap magnetic field caused by the inductance imbalance caused by the adjacent segmented cores [33], which further complicates the end effect. In this paper, multi-analysis models of WS-PMLSM considering the effect of both ends, and the effect of the slot are proposed. In Section 2, the effect of the slot is analyzed with an exact subdomain model, and the SD model of the SW-PMLSM is developed to derive the analytical solution of the air-gap density and obtain the detent force of the slot. In Section 3, the secondary end effect is further investigated based on the conformal map and the complex relative air-gap permeability, which leads to the derivation of the effect law of the permanent magnet end on the detent force. In Section 4, based on the classical magnetic potential theory, the magnetic potential of the single-phase winding is derived by considering the energized section of the stator and the non-energized stator at its two ends as a whole, which leads to end effects in the windings. In Section 5, the relevant conclusions are verified by finite elements and experiments."

Currently, there are two main methods for the numerical solution of the permanent magnetic field. One is to use the vector magnetic potential ~A as the solution variable of the whole solution field, and this algorithm has many degrees of freedom, takes up a large amount of memory, takes a long time to solve, and requires high computer resources; the other is to use the scalar magnetic potential \u03c6 as the solution variable of the solution field, and this algorithm has the advantages of fewer variables, less memory, and fast computation. Therefore, the scalar magnetic potential \u03c6 is used to describe the magnetic field distribution, the magnetic field strength can be expressed in terms of the magnetic scalar potential as follows:\nHx = \u2212 \u2202\u03c6\n\u2202x Hy = \u2212\n\u2202\u03c6 \u2202y (4)\nThe number of slots under a pair of poles is:\nzp = z1 p\n(5)\nwhere p is the number of polar pairs.

The g in the equation represents the air gap. z\u2192 w : z = g2\u03c0 [ 2(w + 1) 1 2 + ln (w+1) 1 2\u22121 (w+1) 1 2 +1 ] w\u2192 t : w = e\u03c0t or t = 1\u03c0 ln w z\u2192 t : z = g\u03c0 [\u221a 2(e\u03c0t + 1) + ln \u221a (e\u03c0t+1)\u22121\u221a (e\u03c0t+1)+1 ] (41)\nIn the t\u2212plane, the magnetic field is regular and the magnetic induction at point b in the z\u2212plane is considered to be maximum and uniform, and the magnetic potential set value A = 1 yields Bmax = 2\u00b50/g(in the z-plane, when passing through the point B, across the trip g/2), then the magnetic density at any point within the end field is:\nB = \u00b50H = \u00b50 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 dtdz \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u00b50\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 dtdw dwdz \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = Bmax\u2223\u2223\u2223(w + 1)\u2212 12 \u2223\u2223\u2223 (42) The magnetic density distribution in this region varies with position in an exponential-\nlike pattern, and the expression is obtained from the curve fitting.\nBend =  Bmaxe \u2212x ge x \u2265 0\nBmaxe x+[(2p\u22121)\u03c4+Lm ] ge x \u2264 \u2212[(2p\u2212 1)\u03c4 + Lm] (43)\nwhere ge is the length of the electromagnetic air gap after the introduction of the cardinality factor. Then, the equivalent air gap length at the secondary end is:\ngend =\n{ gee x ge x \u2265 0\ngee \u2212x\u2212[(2p\u22121))+Lm ] ge x \u2264 \u2212[(2p\u2212 1)\u03c4 + Lm] (44)\nThe change of the air-gap ratio permeability function with the position in this area can be obtained by curve fitting as follows [36]:\nBend Bmax = { 0.6635e\u22121.597x + 0.2012e\u22120.2335x x > 0 \u22120.1782e4.385x + 1.009e0.0007946x \u2212\u03c4 < x \u2264 0 (45)\nThe influence of the end effect caused by the finite length of the permanent magnet on the air-gap magnetic field of WS-PMLSM is shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 7 shows magnetic flux density normalized curve BBmax = f\n( x g\u2032 ) in the longitu-\ndinal end region. When x = \u2212g, the magnetic inductance Bmax, near the transverse edge of the armature core, and the magnetic inductance of the air gap gradually decays, and\nwhen x = \u22120.25 g, B = 0.95Bmax, the magnetic inductance decays to 95% of the maximum value. When x = 0, corresponding to the transverse edge of the armature core, i.e., point A in the z-plane, the magnetic inductance is B = 0.833Bmax. That is, the original magnetic field is weakened, which corresponds to the generation of an additional magnetic field that weakens the main air gap field and causes a change in its distribution. When the WS-PMLSM is at no load, the additional magnetic field generated by the end effect is a constant. In terms of the magnetic circuit, the end effect changes the flux path of the end poles, the air-gap flux density under the surface of the end poles decreases, and the N-pole motor forms an (N + 1) magnetic circuit, as shown in Figure 8. Where B, B1, B2 is B is the magnetic flux density test point , hm is the permanent magnet height, g is the air gap length, hs is the slot height, hc is the height of the stator support .\nIt can be seen that a total of three regions are generated: the end magnetic field region II(x < 0) and the effective magnetic field region I(0 < x < \u03c4), which forms an entire magnetic circuit system with area I and area III(\u03c4 < x < 2\u03c4)."

A passive mover with a width of 150 mm and a stator with a length of 1000 mm were manufactured. The stator was composed of five sets of three-phase winding modules. The passive mover was supported by a linear bearing consisting of LM tracks. The passive mover at the origin of the permanent magnet was measured by a non-contact linear encoder.\nFigure 10 shows the magnetic flux simulation. We chose full coverage and found that the two end effects and the tooth slot effect are very obvious.

From the above figure, it can be seen that the winding slotting causes the change of air gap permeability and the change of air-gap flux density integrates the effect of all slotting effects, and the closer to the slotting surface, the more obvious the slotting effect is."

For the proposed analytical method, the distance between x1 and x2 includes the adjacent unit windings not energized at both sides of the mover, as shown in Figure 8. Finally, the three effects were verified in practice on the experimental platform. We used a thrust test to verify the fluctuations caused by three conditions. The characteristics of the cogging force in the x\u2212 direction at different positions are shown in Figure 16. In the starting section, the deviation of the force is mainly caused by the end effect, then the amplitude decays as a function in the second transition section, and finally, it is completely generated by the slot in the third section. Fluctuations caused by the cogging effect are always present, which is in accordance with the experimental data. The above results show that the cogging effect is caused by the structure and can be solved from the motor body design and control method, while the fluctuations generated by the end effect with high harmonics can be handled by the Taylor expansion method, which is not described here."

            "text": "In this paper, the characteristic law of defense force in motor design and operation is revealed by the method of analytics with WS-PMLSM as the research object. The magnetic field analysis operation is carried out for two types of end effects and slot effects in the motor, which provides a theoretical basis for studying the fluctuation characteristics of electromagnetic force in this type of motor. The following research work is mainly accomplished in this paper. (1) An accurate subdomain analysis model is proposed instead of the hierarchical model for solving the magnetic field distribution and thrust fluctuations of the slotted teeth of the WS-PMLSM motor. Using this analysis model, the magnetic field of the magnet, including the magnetized PM, and the effect of different slot widths on the thrust of the motor can be solved. (2) For the end effect caused by the finite length of WS-PMLSM, the secondary is investigated, the longitudinal end effect formed by the permanent magnet secondary is equated with the edge effect at the end, and the Schwarz\u2013Christoffel transform is used to solve such problem. This method is conventional but effective.\n(3) In WS-PMLSM, the end effect caused by winding discontinuity is less studied. In this paper, Maxwell\u2019s equations are used to study it, and some conclusions are obtained; namely, under the action of three symmetrical voltages, the motor generates three-phase asymmetric currents, and negative sequence currents generate reverse electromagnetic thrust. The impedance matrix of the motor is not a cyclic symmetric array at this time, so the sequence impedance cannot be transformed into a diagonal array. In the next step, the authors will compare the finite element analysis with experimental results for the conclusions obtained in this paper. Thanks to the expression of the WSPMLSM cogging torque waveform, the rotor eddy current loss due to the cogging effect is completed in the next study. Since the local values of flux density or vector potential are not easy to measure, this experiment is not sufficient, but it is possible to compare the integral magnitude, such as counter-electromotive force or torque, which will be completed in the next study.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.Z.; methodology, T.Z.; validation, T.Z. and X.M.; formal analysis, T.Z.; investigation, X.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, T.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, X.M.; supervision, X.M.; funding acquisition, X.M.

In order to solve the convenient, the following formula is n = 1, m = 25, as in Equation (A28).\nTherefore, when n is taken in the range that it can be, it is possible to solve for the possible coefficients.\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3 A1(n) + B1(n) = 0 C1(n) + D1(n) = 0 A1(n)eKnhm + B1(n)e\u2212Knhm \u2212 A2(n)eKnhm \u2212 B2(n)e\u2212Knhm = 0 C1(n)eKnhm + D1(n)e\u2212Knhm \u2212 C2(n)eKnhm \u2212 D2(n)e\u2212Knhm 0 \u00b5r A1(n)eKnhm \u2212 \u00b5rB1(n)e\u2212Knhm \u2212 A2(n)eKnhm + B2(n)e\u2212Knhm = 1Kn Mxnc \u00b5rC1(n)eKnhm \u2212 \u00b5rD1(n)e\u2212Knhm \u2212 C2(n)eKnhm + D2(n)e\u2212Knhm = 1Kn Mxns A2(n)eKn(hm+\u03b4) + B2(n)e\u2212Kn(hm+\u03b4) \u2212\u2211i \u2211m D3i(m)e\u2212Fm(hm+\u03b4)\u03b7si(m, n) = 0 C2(n)eKn(hm+\u03b4) + D2(n)e\u2212Kn(hm+\u03b4) \u2212\u2211i \u2211m D3i(m)e\u2212Fm(hm+\u03b4)\u03b4si(m, n) = 0 2\u03c4 bs \u2211i \u2211n Kn  [ A2(n)eKny3 \u2212 B2(n)e\u2212Kn(hm+\u03b4) ] \u03b7si(m, n) + [ C2(n)eKn(hm+\u03b4) \u2212 D2(n)e\u2212Kn(hm+\u03b4) ] \u03b4si(m, n) + FmD3(m)e\u2212Fm(hm+\u03b4) = 0 (A27)\n 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 E3nn E4nn 0 0 E5nn E6nn 0 0 0 0 0 E3nn E4nn 0 0 E5nn E6nn 0\nE7nn E8nn 0 0 E9nn E10nn 0 0 0 0 0 E7nn E8nn 0 0 E9nn E10nn 0 0 0 0 0 E11nn E12nn 0 0 E17Snn 0 0 0 0 0 0 E11nn E12nn E18Snn 0 0 0 0 E13Snn E14Snn E15Snn E16Snn Wmm\n  A1 B1 C1 D1 A2 B2 C2 D2 D3  =  0 0 0 0 Bb5 Bb6 0 0 0  (A28)\nE3nn(n, n) = eKnhm , E4nn(n, n) = e\u2212Knhm E5nn(n, n) = \u2212eKnhm , E6nn(n, n) = \u2212e\u2212Knhm E7nn(n, n) = \u00b5reKnhm , E8nn(n, n) = \u2212\u00b5re\u2212Knhm E9nn(n, n) = \u2212eKnhm , E10nn(n, n) = e\u2212Knhm\nE11nn(n, n) = eKn(hm+\u03b4), E12nn(n, n) = e\u2212Kn(hm+\u03b4)\n(A29)\nE13Smn = \u2211i \u2211n 2TpP b Kne Kn(hm+\u03b4)\u03b7si(m, n) E14Smn = \u2211i \u2211n\u2212 2TpP b Kne \u2212Kn(hm+\u03b4)\u03b7si(m, n)\n(A30)\nE15Smn = \u2211i \u2211n 2TpP b Kne Kn(hm+\u03b4)\u03b4si(m, n) E16Smn = \u2211i \u2211n\u2212 2TpP b Kne \u2212Kn(hm+\u03b4)\u03b4si(m, n) E17Smn = \u2211i \u2211m\u2212e\u2212Fm(hm+\u03b4)\u03b7si(m, n) E18Smn = \u2211i \u2211m\u2212e\u2212Fm(hm+\u03b4)\u03b4si(m, n)\n(A31)\nWmm(mi, mi) = Fme\u2212Fm(hm+\u03b4) Bb5 = 1Kn Mxnc, Bb6 = 1\nKn Mxns.
