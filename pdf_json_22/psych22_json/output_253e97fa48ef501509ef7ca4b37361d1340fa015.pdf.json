    "abstractText": "Background. Neurocognitive testing may advance the goal of predicting near-term suicide risk. The current study examined whether performance on a Go/No-go (GNG) task, and computational modeling to extract latent cognitive variables, could enhance prediction of suicide attempts within next 90 days, among individuals at high-risk for suicide. Method. 136 Veterans at high-risk for suicide previously completed a computer-based GNG task requiring rapid responding (Go) to target stimuli, while withholding responses (No-go) to infrequent foil stimuli; behavioral variables included false alarms to foils (failure to inhibit) and missed responses to targets. We conducted a secondary analysis of these data, with outcomes defined as actual suicide attempt (ASA), other suicide-related event (OtherSE) such as interrupted/aborted attempt or preparatory behavior, or neither (noSE), within 90-days after GNG testing, to examine whether GNG variables could improve ASA prediction over standard clinical variables. A computational model (linear ballistic accumulator, LBA) was also applied, to elucidate cognitive mechanisms underlying group differences. Results. On GNG, increased miss rate selectively predicted ASA, while increased false alarm rate predicted OtherSE (without ASA) within the 90-day follow-up window. In LBA modeling, ASA (but not OtherSE) was associated with decreases in decisional efficiency to targets, suggesting differences in the evidence accumulation process were specifically associated with upcoming ASA. Conclusions. These findings suggest that GNG may improve prediction of near-term suicide risk, with distinct behavioral patterns in those who will attempt suicide within the next 90 days. Computational modeling suggests qualitative differences in cognition in individuals at near-term risk of suicide attempt.",

Neurocognitive testing may advance the goal of predicting near-term suicide risk. The current study examined whether performance on a Go/No-go (GNG) task, and computational modeling to extract latent cognitive variables, could enhance prediction of suicide attempts within next 90 days, among individuals at high-risk for suicide. Method. 136 Veterans at high-risk for suicide previously completed a computer-based GNG task requiring rapid responding (Go) to target stimuli, while withholding responses (No-go) to infrequent foil stimuli; behavioral variables included false alarms to foils (failure to inhibit) and missed responses to targets. We conducted a secondary analysis of these data, with outcomes defined as actual suicide attempt (ASA), other suicide-related event (OtherSE) such as interrupted/aborted attempt or preparatory behavior, or neither (noSE), within 90-days after GNG testing, to examine whether GNG variables could improve ASA prediction over standard clinical variables. A computational model (linear ballistic accumulator, LBA) was also applied, to elucidate cognitive mechanisms underlying group differences. Results. On GNG, increased miss rate selectively predicted ASA, while increased false alarm rate predicted OtherSE (without ASA) within the 90-day follow-up window. In LBA modeling, ASA (but not OtherSE) was associated with decreases in decisional efficiency to targets, suggesting differences in the evidence accumulation process were specifically associated with upcoming ASA. Conclusions. These findings suggest that GNG may improve prediction of near-term suicide risk, with distinct behavioral patterns in those who will attempt suicide within the next 90 days. Computational modeling suggests qualitative differences in cognition in individuals at near-term risk of suicide attempt.\nIntroduction\nA priority in suicide risk assessment is the identification not only of individuals who are at risk of dying by suicide, but also the periods when their risk is elevated (for review, Glenn & Nock, 2014). Because intensive clinical and supportive interventions are difficult to apply for long periods of time, a means to identify individuals at near-term risk of suicide can significantly aid suicide prevention efforts by informing which among a population of at-risk individuals can benefit from intensive efforts during an upcoming window of time. While many epidemiological risk factors have been identified that associate with lifetime risk of suicide attempt, these may be distinguished from warning signs or near-term factors that indicate more proximal risk within an upcoming window of days to weeks (Franklin et al., 2016). Illustrating how\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722001003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nlittle is known about proximal risk, a meta-analysis of 50 years of suicide risk factor research reported a mean follow-up period across studies identifying risk factors of 10 years, with only 5% of studies examining a follow-up period of \u2a7d6 months (Franklin et al., 2016). This is likely due to an inherent methodological challenge: using shorter follow-up periods reduces the likelihood of observing a rare event such as a suicide attempt (Glenn & Nock, 2014). Despite these challenges, detection of warning signs to indicate proximal risk would be of immense clinical value (Gordon, Avenevoli, & Pearson, 2020) and new research in this area is emerging (e.g. Bagge et al., 2022).\nSuicidal behavior has been linked to identifiable behavior patterns on a range of neurocognitive tasks (Richard-Devantoy, Berlim, & Jollant, 2014). Such tasks can provide objective markers, and also potentially provide a window into cognitive mechanisms involved with suicidal behavior. For example, reduced ability to inhibit prepotent motor responses has been observed in individuals with a history of suicidal behavior (Mann et al., 2009). One such task, the Go/No-go (GNG) task, requires rapidly responding (\u2018Go\u2019) to target stimuli but occasionally withholding responses (\u2018No-go\u2019) to infrequent foil stimuli. Several retrospective cross-sectional studies report increased false alarm rates (i.e., failures to inhibit) in participants with a history of suicide attempt (e.g. Richard-Devantoy et al., 2012; Westheide et al., 2008). In more fine-grained analysis, false alarm rates were higher among patients with a suicide attempt in the prior week compared to those with suicide attempt in the prior year, suggesting reduced response inhibition may be sensitive for near-term suicide attempt (Interian et al., 2020). An important open question is therefore whether cognitive processes may be associated with, and even predict, short-term risk.\nAs a first step toward this goal, the current study builds on existing research by examining whether GNG performance is prospectively associated with suicide attempt. The study considers a sample of participants at high-risk for suicide enrolled in a randomized clinical trial (RCT). The trial, which showed reductions in suicidal behavior (Interian et al., 2021), observed suicide-related events with enough frequency to meaningfully examine shorter observation windows. Many of these participants also completed GNG at baseline and at several points during a follow-up year. Our primary hypothesis was that GNG performance was predictive of near-term (90-days) suicide attempt, above and beyond standard variables used in suicide risk assessment (i.e., number of previous suicide attempts, level of suicidal ideation).\nWe also applied a computational model to determine whether observed differences in GNG performance could be understood in terms of altered latent cognitive processes among those with an upcoming suicide attempt. Evidence accumulation models such as the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) assume that, during speeded decision-making, evidence is gradually accumulated for possible responses, until a winning response is triggered. These models attempt to fit the entire distribution of reaction times (RTs) for correct and incorrect responses, and estimate individual-level latent cognitive parameters, such as response bias, response caution, and decisional efficiency, that may help explain observable behavior. Here, we applied a Bayesian version of the LBA (Brown & Heathcote, 2008; Donkin, Brown, Heathcote, & Wagenmakers, 2011) to the GNG data. Our exploratory hypothesis was that one or more LBA variables would be predictive of near-term suicide attempt, above and beyond the standard suicide risk variables, potentially suggesting specific cognitive processes altered in\nat-risk individuals entering a period of high risk for suicide attempt."

These services included suicide safety planning, clinical monitoring and attempts to engage in regular mental health care.\nInclusion criteria for the RCT were both (1) severe suicidal ideation in the prior 30 days and (2) past-year actual, aborted, or interrupted suicide attempt (Posner, Brodsky, Yershova, Buchanan, & Mann, 2014) or placement on the VHA high-risk for suicide list.

These follow-up sessions included updated C-SSRS (covering the period since last session) and SSI (covering prior week).\nAt each session, participants completed several computerbased tests of neurocognitive processes, including GNG and a color-word Stroop interference task (MacLeod, 1991; Stroop, 1935). In most cases, neurocognitive testing occurred immediately after collection of clinical and self-report data."

Thirteen (9.6%) participants had 1+ actual suicide\nattempt (ASA) during the one-year follow-up period, while 25 (18.4%) had no ASA but 1+ OtherSE. After data cleansing, n = 284 GNG datafiles obtained from 130 unique participants were analyzed.\nGNG datafiles were classified into outcome groups based on the 90-day window following GNG testing, resulting in 18 datafiles classed as ASA (2 from female participants, 11.1%), including one case with two ASAs in the 90-day window. Another 29 were classed as OtherSE (5 from female participants, 17.2%); of these, 9 cases involved SI-related hospital admissions without suiciderelated behavior, 7 involved aborted/interrupted attempts, and the remaining 13 cases involved preparatory behavior. The remaining 237 were classed noSE (29 from female participants, 12.2%). Detailed GNG results for each outcome group are summarized in the online Supplementary Table.\nGNG task performance and prediction of near-term suicide outcomes\nCompared to the noSE reference group, misses were higher in the ASA group [Fig. 1c; OR 1.05, (1.02\u20131.08), p < 0.001], but not in the OtherSE group [OR 0.99, (0.96\u20131.03), p = 0.713]. Conversely, false alarm rates were higher in the OtherSE group [Fig. 1d; OR 1.04, (1.01\u20131.07), p = 0.022], but not in the ASA group [OR 0.99, (0.94\u20131.04), p = 0.632]. Figure 1e and f show false alarms for the two subtypes of foil separately, illustrating that the OtherSE group made more false alarms on both the relatively easy location foils and the more difficult identity foils.\nTo relate ORs to observed GNG differences, we exponentiated raw beta coefficients multiplied by the observed group mean differences. Thus, while every unit increase in misses corresponded to a 5% increase in odds of ASA, the observed mean difference in misses (14%) corresponded to OR 1.92, or a 92% increase in odds of ASA within the next 90 days. Similarly, while every unit increase in false alarm rate corresponded to a 4% increase in odds of OtherSE, the observed mean difference in false alarms (6%) corresponded to OR 1.25, or a 25% increase in odds of OtherSE (excluding ASA) within the next 90 days.\nOur primary hypothesis was that GNG variables could predict upcoming ASA, above and beyond the contributions of other standard suicide risk variables. Table 2 summarizes results of the GEE using GNG variables as predictors, adjusting for suicide risk variables and other pertinent covariates. As expected, suicidal ideation at the time of testing increased the odds of an upcoming ASA while receipt of study treatment in the RCT decreased the odds of ASA. Consistent with our hypothesis, increased rate of GNG misses increased the odds of ASA, independently of the other covariates. Increased rate of GNG false alarms was associated with increased odds of upcoming OtherSE (excluding ASA), independently of the other covariates.\nLatent parameters from evidence accumulation model\nOf the 284 GNG datafiles analyzed above, the LBA could not be applied to 22 datafiles containing <2 false alarms (so RT variance could not be calculated). The LBA model was run on the remaining 262 datafiles (17 ASA, 28 OtherSE, 217 noSE).\nPosterior parameter estimates are shown along with other detailed results in the online Supplementary Table. As shown in Fig. 2b, the OtherSE group had a stronger response bias for Go responding than the noSE reference group [OR 1.02 (1.01\u20131.04), p = 0.009], while the ASA group did not [OR 1.01\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722001003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n(0.99\u20131.03), p = 0.20]. The pattern of stronger response bias for Go in the OtherSE group is consistent with their high rate of false alarms on the GNG task.\nThe ASA group had lower decisional efficiency for targets [Fig. 2c; OR 0.63 (0.46\u20130.87), p = 0.004], while the OtherSE group did not [OR 0.80 (0.57\u20131.11), p = 0.18]. This relative difficulty of the ASA group in accumulating evidence towards a correct response to targets may explain their high rates of misses on the GNG task. Neither the OtherSE nor ASA group differed from the noSE group in decisional efficiency for foils [Fig. 2d; OtherSE OR 1.13 (0.80\u20131.59), p = 0.48; ASA OR 1.40 (0.81\u20132.43), p = 0.23].\nTo relate ORs to observed parameter differences, the observed differences between ASA and noSE on decisional efficiency for targets (\u22120.79) increased the odds of ASA by 43%. The observed 14-point difference between OtherSE and noSE on response bias increased the odds of OtherSE by 34%.\nTo test our exploratory hypothesis, Table 3 summarizes results of the GEE using LBA parameters as predictors, adjusting for standard suicide risk variables and other covariates. Response bias (favoring Go responding) was strongly related to upcoming OtherSE, adjusting for the covariates; however, both decisional efficiency for targets and decisional efficiency for foils were significantly related to ASA within 90 days, after adjusting for the covariates: Every unit increase in decisional efficiency for foils more than doubled the odds of an ASA; while every unit decrease in decisional efficiency for targets increased the odds of an ASA."

Several prior studies have associated GNG performance with prior suicide attempt (Interian et al., 2020; Richard-Devantoy et al., 2012; Westheide et al., 2008); the current study investigated whether GNG performance could be used to prospectively predict future ASAs.\nIn our sample of high-risk Veterans, increased false alarms were predictive of an upcoming SE excluding ASA. This is consistent with our own prior analysis showing a relationship between recent (prior) ASA and false alarms at baseline in this dataset (Interian et al., 2020) and other studies associating prior SE with decreased response inhibition (Richard-Devantoy et al., 2012; Westheide et al., 2008).

Other prior studies have similarly reported increased miss rates as an important indicator of suicidality (Harfmann, Rhyner, & Ingram, 2019; Westheide et al., 2008; Wright, Lipszyc, Dupuis, Thayapararajah, & Schachar, 2014). The significant association of misses with ASA, after accounting for other variables, also held in a supplemental analysis\nwhere the GEE was run with binary outcome coding ASA v. all other outcomes (results not shown).\nIncreased miss rates in the ASA group could reflect several cognitive processes. First, it could reflect a general impairment in attention; however, this group did not show evidence of general attention/concentration deficits as indexed by Stroop task d-scores. Increased miss rate could also reflect a general psychomotor slowing which would reduce the likelihood of completing a Go response before the end of the 1.5-s trial period; however, the ASA group showed no slowing of behavioral RT, compared to the other groups (online Supplementary Table).\nTable 3.

The model results suggested no evidence of general slowing of stimulus encoding and motor response time (t0) nor of a general response bias favoring No-go in the ASA group. Rather, the behavior of those with upcoming ASA was consistent with reduced decisional efficiency for targets (Fig. 2d). Here, the reduced decisional efficiency for targets in the ASA (but not OtherSE or noSE) group suggests qualitative, not merely quantitative, differences in cognitive processes in a subset of at-risk individuals who will soon attempt suicide.\nA key strength of computational modeling is to propose formal, mechanistic and biologically plausible mechanisms underlying observable behaviors (Millner, Robinaugh, & Nock, 2020). In electrophysiology studies, decisional efficiency has been linked with the build-up rate of the P3b component of the P300 event-related potential (Kelly & O\u2019Connell, 2013), and appears to originate from temporal-parietal activity associated with stimulus detection and attention (Polich, 2007). Interestingly, reduced decisional efficiency is emerging as a neurocognitive risk factor in a range of psychopathologies (for review, see Weigard & Sripada, 2021). A few studies have suggested that decisional efficiency can be increased by catecholamine agonists that modulate brain signal-to-noise ratios (Peters, Vega, Weinstein, Mitchell, & Kayser, 2020; Weigard, Heathcote, & Sripada, 2019), which may be particularly relevant given that brain serotonergic systems have been associated with suicidality (Oquendo et al., 2014; van Heeringen & Mann, 2014). This raises the intriguing possibility of therapeutic intervention to modify brain substrates underlying reduced decisional efficiency, which might in turn help to remediate dysfunctional cognitive and executive processes underlying suicidality. This also illustrates a key utility of computational modeling, which is to identify cognitive phenotypes that can help bridge between brain circuits and clinical behavior.\nFurther studies are obviously indicated to further explore these ideas, including replication of the current results, before any clinical recommendations can be made. Nevertheless, the strength and specificity of the relationship between misses and ASAs in the current study suggest that GNG misses may be a proximal warning sign of suicide risk, as well as an indicator providing some insight into cognitive processes that may change as highrisk individuals enter a period of acute risk for suicide. If the current results were appropriately replicated/validated, the GNG might represent a fairly short, computer-based screening tool that could be administered in an acute care setting or delivered via Internet or mobile device for more routine follow-up; positive screens (e.g., an increase in an individual\u2019s GNG miss rate) could trigger specific interventions including increased clinical encounters, more intensive safety planning, or increased monitoring efforts during periods of elevated risk (Stanley et al., 2018).\nThe fact that decreased response inhibition (increased false alarm rate) was associated in our study with OtherSE, but not with upcoming ASA, may at first appear at odds with the idea that decreased inhibition might mediate the transition from suicidal thoughts to suicide attempts (i.e., from ideation to action). One possible interpretation is that different neurocognitive deficits may be more prominent during different phases of the transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt; for example, decision-making difficulties may lead to a downward spiral of\nmood and function, while impulsivity may be associated when individuals take action to escape the pain. Another possibility is that there may be different deficits at play with different subpopulations who exhibit different types of attempts. This would be consistent with recent suggestions that cognitive impulsivity (e.g., reduced ability to delay gratification) is decreased in individuals with high-lethality suicide attempts (Anestis, Soberay, Gutierrez, Hern\u00e1ndez, & Joiner, 2014; Dombrovski et al., 2011; Keilp et al., 2014b). These, together with the current results, suggest that some attempts may be characterized by decisional difficulties and less reactive responding, while other attempts may be characterized by greater reactivity and impulsivity. The emerging field of ecological momentary assessment may shed light on these questions, by allowing short cognitive tasks to be administered in a more naturalistic setting, potentially allowing the detection of more rapid fluctuations in cognitive processes closer to the time of an upcoming ASA (e.g. Le et al., 2021).\nIt is also useful to compare rates of GNG errors in our highrisk group against a sample of putatively healthy control participants. For example, Hoffman et al. (2022) administered this same GNG task to a sample of over 38 000 Army Soldiers (17% females; mean age 20.97 years), of whom the vast majority (98%) reported no lifetime history of suicide attempt. This study reported a mean of \u223c10% false alarms, quite similar to the overall rate in the current study (Fig. 1c and online Supplementary Table); a follow-up cohort (including 3.4% with \u2018new-onset\u2019 suicide attempt during the 3\u20137 year follow-up period), again reported \u223c12% false alarms. Hoffman et al. reported that GNG false alarms was a significant predictor of retrospective history of lifetime suicide attempts, but not a significant predictor in a prospective model predicting emergence of new-onset ASA at follow-up. This seems to lend credence to the finding in the current study that reduced inhibition, as indexed by GNG false alarms, is not a significant prospective predictor, at least when measurements are made weeks or months before the attempt. Again, assessments made more frequently, and/or closer to the time of an upcoming ASA, might detect more rapid fluctuations in these cognitive processes, and thus be more successful prospective predictors.\nA key limitation of our study is the low incidence of outcome events (particularly ASAs), even within our high-risk sample. Indeed, the low frequency of attempts, even among high-risk individuals, has been a prediction challenge clinically, but also for research studies. Other limitations of the current study include underrepresentation of females among our Veteran participants which may have masked gender differences, and lack of information on psychotropic medication that could have influenced behavior. Also, about 7% of GNG datafiles were excluded due to apparent subject non-compliance or failure to understand task instructions, and a further \u223c10% of GNG datafiles could not be subjected to LBA modeling due to too few false alarms, suggesting some participants may have been trading speed for accuracy. It would be interesting to see if the current pattern of results were replicated with a simpler GNG task, putatively requiring less cognitive load than the current task which involved multiple types of foil. It is also important that all participants were enrolled in a treatment trial, which may have modified their behavior across time. Indeed, fewer participants in the MBCT-S treatment group had ASAs during follow-up than those in the control group (Interian et al., 2021). Nevertheless, current results remained significant after adjusting for treatment group effects in the multivariate models. In fact, any study enrolling at-risk\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722001003 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nparticipants is likely to be complicated by the ethical necessity for interventions related to suicide prevention.\nDespite these limitations, our finding of increased miss rates associated with upcoming suicide attempt suggests there may overt behavioral profiles that can be detected in advance of an upcoming ASA, and also points to the potential utility of neurocognitive deficits to provide objective measures to complement existing clinically-assessed warning signs.\nSupplementary material.
