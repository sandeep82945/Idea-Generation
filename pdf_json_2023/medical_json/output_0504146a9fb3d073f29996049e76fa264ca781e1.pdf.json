    "abstractText": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common and morbid complication of left heart disease (LHD), comprising two subtypes: (1) isolated post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (IpcPH) and (2) combined post-capillary and pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension (Cpc-PH). Knowledge regarding the physiological characteristics that distinguish Cpc-PH, which has a worse prognosis, from Ipc-PH remains limited. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the utility of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) variables in detecting Cpc-PH.",

            "text": "Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a common and morbid complication of left heart disease (LHD). It comprises the following two subtypes: (1) isolated post-capillary PH (Ipc-PH) and (2) combined post-capillary and pre-capillary PH (Cpc-PH) [1]. Pathologically and genetically, Cpc-PH is considered to possess characteristics that are intermediate between those of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), that is pre-capillary PH, and LHD, that is post-capillary PH [2\u20134]; furthermore, it has a worse prognosis than that of Ipc-PH. However, knowledge regarding the clinical or physiological characteristics that distinguish between these two sub-phenotypes remains limited [5]. The efficacy of pulmonary vasodilators in Cpc-PH has been explored recently [6, 7]. Despite the increased importance of detection and differentiation of Cpc-PH to enable a tailored approach for PH treatment, an invasive evaluation for PH remains mandatory.\nThe cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is a well-established noninvasive test for assessing functional capacity and exercise limitation. Based on pathophysiology, it provides mechanistic insights and important information on gas exchange, ventilatory efficacy, and cardiac function during exercise [8, 9]. Peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2), which reflects the cardiac output (CO) during exercise, and other ventilatory variables (such as the ventilation/carbon dioxide-production relationship slope [VE vs. VCO2 slope]) remain the most frequently applied variables in the CPET and have been used as markers of disease severity and prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF) and PAH [10\u201313]. In terms of the CPET, PAH is characterized by a lower peak VO2, marked hyperventilation, a low end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PETCO2), and an elevated VE vs. VCO2 slope [13, 14]. The combination of a low PETCO2 and high ventilatory equivalents for carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) at the anaerobic threshold (AT) has been considered suggestive of PH [15]. Previous reports on the differentiation of Cpc-PH have proposed the usefulness of various ventilatory parameters, such as the VE/VCO2 at AT, PETCO2, dead-space ventilation-to-tidal ventilation (VD/VT), and lowest VE/VCO2%pred; however, no consensus has been reached yet [16, 17].\nAn examination of the CPET variables in patients with Cpc-PH may provide mechanistic\ninsights into the pathophysiology of Cpc-PH and facilitate the detection of early abnormal adaptations leading to Cpc-PH. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the utility of CPET variables in the non-invasive detection of Cpc-PH, which is considered to possess characteristics of both pre-capillary and post-capillary components."

The O2 saturation in the pulmonary artery (SvO2) and in the arterial blood i.e. in the radial or femoral artery (SaO2) was measured.

Therefore, Cpc-PH appeared to be a relatively uncommon condition, consistent with previous findings [17]. The present study\u2019s results also revealed that the peak effort PETCO2 and \u0394VO2/\u0394WR were the optimal predictors of Cpc-PH, thereby corroborating the findings of previous studies where ventilatory variables from CPET proved useful in differentiating Cpc-PH [16, 17]."

            "text": "PH is a common complication of LHD, and it develops in response to a passive increase in left-sided filling pressures, more specifically the left atrial pressure. While it is associated with a poor prognosis [22], Cpc-PH is known to have an even worse prognosis [5].\nGenetically, Cpc-PH resembles PAH. Assad et al. found that patients with Cpc-PH had\ngenetic abnormalities in pathways that were highly active in the lungs and were known to contribute to the pathophysiology of PAH. These exploratory genetic findings suggest that CpcPH may have a pathophysiology distinct from that of Ipc-PH [2].\nFrom a pathological perspective, progressive thickening and collagen proliferation occur in\nthe lamina densa in order to protect against fluid accumulation in the interstitium of the endothelium and the vascular wall as well as in the alveoli [3, 4, 23]. In Ipc-PH, small arteries exhibit endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction, despite no defined changes in the composition of small pulmonary arteries. The pulmonary veins also show a certain degree of thickness and a tendency towards arteriolarization. Moreover, in Cpc-PH, the venous system becomes fully arteriolarized, and small arteries exhibit a clear muscularization process and remodeling; an impairment of gas exchange diffusion or a lengthening of the path between air and the red blood cells is prominent.\nIn an effort to differentiate Cpc-PH from Ipc-PH in a non-invasive manner, a physiology-\nbased approach is important to detect these pathological changes. In our cohort, the low value of peak effort PETCO2 value, which is one of the ventilatory variables in the CPET, was an optimal indicator of Cpc-PH; thus, it reflected a marked impairment of CO2 release into the alveolar space.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286057 May 22, 2023 9 / 15\nUsefulness of peak effort PETCO2 in the detection of Cpc-PH\nThe differentiation of Cpc-PH between PAH (pre-capillary PH) and PH-LHD (post-capillary PH) using the CPET was reported by Caravita et al. [17]. They found that VE/VCO2 at the AT was useful in the detection of Cpc-PH and that Cpc-PH was an intermediate between PAH and Ipc-PH in terms of gas exchange. Among the ventilatory parameters obtained using the submaximal exercise test, a low PETCO2, high VE/VCO2, and high VD/VT were reportedly characteristic of Cpc-PH [16]. Moreover, the exacerbation of pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities in patients with Cpc-PH was related to an excessive rise in the pulmonary vascular pressures [16]. Zhong et al. also reported that VE/VCO2-related parameters were diagnostic variables for the presence of pre-capillary components in patients with PH-LHD [24]. Among\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286057.g003\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286057 May 22, 2023 10 / 15\nthe ventilatory variables, the lowest VE/VCO2%pred, which was obtained from the submaximal exercise test, was the optimal predictor of Cpc-PH (as demonstrated by an AUC of 0.77). From our data, the peak PETCO2 was also particularly useful in detecting Cpc-PH (as demonstrated by an AUC of 0.73). This is comparable to the findings reported by Zhong et al. In the maximal exercise test, the peak PETCO2 was the optimal diagnostic variable. Our findings\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0286057.g004\n(i.e., lower peak PETCO2 and lower \u0394VO2/\u0394WR in CpC-PH) solidified the usefulness of CPET parameters for Cpc-PH detection.\nIn the HF population, the PETCO2 is a known CPET variable that potentially possesses\nprognostic information [25]. In particular, Arena et al. reported that PETCO2 changes from rest to the RC point, PETCO2 at the RC point, and PETCO2 at peak exercise were all significant predictors of cardiac related events. Low value of PETCO2 during exercise have been classically considered to strongly reflect a low CO during exercise. Matsumoto et al. found that PETCO2 at the RC point was significantly correlated with the CO at peak exercise in patients with cardiac disease [26]. Furthermore, they concluded that the decrease in CO lead to a decrease in alveolar capillary perfusion and PCO2 into the alveolar air, resulting in a decrease in PETCO2 during exercise. Moreover, Tanabe et al. revealed a significant correlation between the PETCO2 and cardiac index at peak exercise in patients with HF [27].\nMechanisms by which peak effort PETCO2 predicts Cpc-PH\nIn patients with PAH, the PETCO2 decline associated with exercise was more distinct than that in those with LHD [28]. Hemnes et al. demonstrated that the measurement of resting PETCO2 at bedside may distinguish patients with PAH from those with pulmonary venous hypertension or no PH [29]. Moreover, Welch et al. also demonstrated that this readily available resting PETCO2 may be a physiologically relevant marker of poor prognosis in PAH [30]. They reported that lung diffusion for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is correlated with the resting PETCO2, suggesting that these variables could provide potentially similar insights into the degree of pulmonary vasculopathy in patients with PAH. DLCO measures the ability of a gas to diffuse from the alveoli to the red blood cells in the pulmonary capillaries and depends on the alveolar\u2013capillary membrane diffusive capacity and the capillary volume (which is the amount of blood flowing through the ventilated alveolar\u2013capillary units over a period of time i.e. a few seconds) [31]. Lack of capillary perfusion leads to decrease exchanging gas into the alveolar capillaries and causes increased dead space. The correlation between the PETCO2 and DLCO suggests that both are markers of dead-space ventilation and that the PETCO2 may also reflect the capillary membrane diffusive capacity and capillary volume i.e. the CO. The peak PETCO2 may better capture the pathological changes in Cpc-PH, whereby the venous system becomes fully arteriolarized and gas exchange is strongly impaired."
