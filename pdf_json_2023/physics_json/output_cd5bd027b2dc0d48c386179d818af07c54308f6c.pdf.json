    "abstractText": "Targeted synthesis of C/composite Ni-based material was carried out by the method of matrix isolation. The composite was formed with regard to the features of the reaction of catalytic decomposition of methane. The morphology and physicochemical properties of these materials have been characterized using a number of methods: elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, temperature programmed reduction (TPR-H2), specific surface areas (SSA), thermogravimetric analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC). It was shown by FTIR spectroscopy that nickel ions are immobilized on the polymer molecule of polyvinyl alcohol, and during heat treatment, polycondensation sites are formed on the surface of the polymer molecule. By the method of Raman spectroscopy, it was shown that already at a temperature of 250 \u25e6C, a developed conjugation system with sp2-hybridized carbon atoms begins to form. The SSA method shows that the formation of the composite material resulted in a matrix with a developed specific surface area of 20 to 214 m2/g. The XRD method shows that nanoparticles are essentially characterized by Ni, NiO reflexes. The composite material was established by microscopy methods to be a layered structure with uniformly distributed nickel-containing particles 5\u201310 nm in size. The XPS method determined that metallic nickel was present on the surface of the material. A high specific activity was found in the process of catalytic decomposition of methane\u2014from 0.9 to 1.4 gH2/gcat/h, XCH4, from 33 to 45% at a reaction temperature of 750 \u25e6C without the stage of catalyst preliminary activation. During the reaction, the formation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes occurs.",

            "text": "The rapid development of materials science has allowed for the creation of composite materials with \u201cadvanced\u201d properties, which is particularly relevant for heterogeneous catalysis [1\u20133]. In this case, composite materials based on synthetic polymers can be considered as promising catalysts for many processes characterized by the required set of physicochemical characteristics [4\u20136]. One of the most important characteristics in the design of catalytically active materials is the requirement for the formation of a developed surface, high dispersion of the active phase, and a certain phase composition [7\u201312]. Modern materials science has developed various approaches for creating systems with a developed surface and dispersion [13\u201315]. Traditional methods for increasing the dispersion of active particles include the use of carriers with a highly developed surface and structural promoters for both the active phase (such as copper or cobalt) and the substrate used (La, Ce, Y) [16,17]. The structural promoters used affect both the phase composition and the oxide environment [18,19]. Nevertheless, the applied systems do not allow for the creation of highly concentrated (highloaded) catalysts while maintaining a stable nanoscale state of the active component [20,21].\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2534. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15112534 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2534 2 of 20\nThese limitations lead to the necessity of creating volumetrically structured highly dispersed catalytic systems primarily in the absence of any oxide carrier [22]. Composite materials can solve the problem of catalytic construction. The task can be partially solved by creating rigid frameworks based on nickel-containing foam [23]. Methods for limiting the mobility of nanoscale metal particles in a solid non-oxide carbon-based dispersion medium are more interesting [24,25]. This method of obtaining composites is called matrix isolation [26,27]. Varieties of this method include stabilizing the polymer suspension (microencapsulation) or forming distributed nanoparticles during thermal treatment of a solid joint solution of metal salt and polymer, which is accompanied by structuring and nanocapsulation of the metal-containing phase in a carbon matrix [28\u201331]. The nature of the reagent and the conditions of the catalytic reaction determine the methods of obtaining the composite [32,33]. Transition metals of group VIII are the basis of C1 chemistry processes. These processes are the basis of environmental technologies such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen production, eco fuel production, and others [34,35]. The success of using C/composites for environmental processes is demonstrated in [36,37]. FT synthesis was carried out on composites prepared by the organic matrix method, and the synthesized materials showed high activity in the process of carbon monoxide hydrogenation; carbon monoxide conversion reached 100%, and the specific activity was 126 \u00b5molCO/gFe/gCo/s. It has been shown that samples with a narrow particle size distribution (davg from 5 to 14 nm) can be successfully synthesized by this method, which determines the catalytic activity of the sample due to the correlation of size and catalytic properties (up to 38 \u00b5mol/gFe/gCo/s) [36]. In forming C/composite materials, there is often a system of polyconjugated bonds present that can interact with the active phase of the catalyst, altering the local electron density, which leads to improvements or deteriorations in catalytic properties. For example, Wang et al. [38] considered the case of the CO2 electroreduction reaction in the presence of Ni@C3N4 and Ni@C3N4-CN, and it is shown that in the case of Ni@C3N4, d-\u03c0 conjugation occurs, which facilitates electron transfer from the metallic particle to the substrate, making it significantly difficult to activate CO2 molecules on the metal active sites. Ni et al. [39] examined catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of oxygen based on transition metals and conjugated polymers. The authors showed that strong d-\u03c0 conjugation affects the angle between the dxz/dyz orbitals of the centers formed by the transition metals, which leads to enhanced intermediate adsorption and amplifies the effect of electronic modulation of substituent groups on the ligands. The influence on the catalyst structure allows for control over the activity of the resulting catalytic systems and ultimately leads to the synthesis of a catalyst that surpasses the benchmark Pt/C. The effect of conjugated structures on catalytic properties is also shown in the case of photocatalysis [40]. Modification of TiO2 with compounds containing delocalized \u03c0-conjugated systems can increase catalytic activity, and the level of this enhancement can be modulated by various delocalized \u03c0-conjugated systems. Li et al. [41] examined nanosheets based on polymetalloporphyrins with a diene bond and possessing constant porosity and \u03c0-conjugation. When monodisperse nickel atoms are deposited on the nanosheets, a heterogeneous catalyst with unprecedented catalytic activity and selectivity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol under mild conditions is formed. According to the authors [42,43], in the case of the process of carbon monoxide hydrogenation, which forms the composite during the synthesis, the polyconjugated matrix that is formed interacts with the active metal-containing particles, promoting an enhancing effect and increasing the activity of composite catalysts. One of the rapidly developing areas of catalysis is the catalytic decomposition of methane to obtain COx-free hydrogen [44,45]. Hydrogen is at the forefront of new environmentally neutral technologies and can be used in fuel cells, energy, etc. [46\u201350]. The catalytic decomposition of methane is based on the following reaction [51]:\nCH4 \u2192 C + 2H2 (1)\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2534 3 of 20\nThe catalysts used in this process can be divided into two classes: carbon-based [52] and metal-containing [44,53,54]. Carbon-based catalysts operate at higher temperatures, from 800 \u25e6C, while metal-containing catalysts work at 600\u2013700 \u25e6C [55]. Combining both types of catalysts\u2014carbon-based and metal-containing\u2014seems promising. For example, the use of activated carbon (AC) in [56] increased the catalytic efficiency by acting as a co-catalyst and promoting the formation of catalytic carbon fibers. Ni-PVA composites synthesized by the matrix isolation method through thermolysis in an inert atmosphere, which are the subject of this study, have not been described in the literature. Novell presents a synthesis of composite material based on polyvinyl alcohol, a water-soluble polymer with side oxygen-containing groups capable of exhibiting donor\u2013 acceptor interactions with active metal and thereby forming a highly dispersed catalytically active matrix with a predetermined phase composition. Ni-PVA composites were studied in the process of methane decomposition. This approach to composite synthesis is particularly relevant for these processes, as the active phase of the catalyst is the metallic nickel phase, which can be formed at the composite preparation stage. This is very relevant for industrial applications, as it potentially eliminates the activation stage of the catalytic system."

The figure shows dependence of methane conversion on the experiment temperature (Figure 12).\nFigure 12. Temperature dependence of methane conversion in the thermocatalytic methane decomposition reaction for samples of composite materials.\nThe curves of the thermocatalytic decomposition of methane, shown in Figure 12, represent the classic bell-shaped characteristic curves [91,92]. Separately, it should be noted that the temperature range in which the catalysts exhibit high activity was 700\u2013800 \u00b0C, which is slightly higher than the traditional one for Ni-containing catalysts [93].

Figure 12 also shows the results of methane decomposition in the absence of the catalyst. Despite the fact that in the studied temperature range \u2206Gr < 0 [91], the methane conversion is significantly lower than the results obtained in the presence of catalysts. Based on the results of these tests, it was revealed that the highest methane conversion on all synthesized composites is typical for a temperature of 750 \u00b0C. The main parameters of the process at a temperature of 750 \u00b0C are shown in Table 5.\nThe activity of Ni-PVA composites prepared at different temperatures was 1.9\u20133.2 g\u041d2/gNi/h versus 0.4\u20131.8 g\u041d2/gNi/h (the given values were calculated based on research data) [44,95\u201397].

The main parameters of the process at a temperature of 750 \u25e6C are shown in Table 5.\nTable 5.

Additionally, it should be noted that Ni-based systems with promoters such as noble metals usually exhibit the highest activity [99\u2013101]. Noble metals are traditionally added to deposited systems to reduce the temperature of preliminary reduction and intensify the hydrogen spillover process [102]. This effect was achieved in this study by directed construction of a catalytic system with a predetermined phase composition and nanoscale size of the active particles. Furthermore, a part of the catalytic surface is covered with a carbon matrix, which serves as a protective capsule and prevents oxidation of the active catalyst phase. It is worth noting the extreme dependence of the activity of the composites on the temperature of their synthesis. Maximum activity was observed in the sample prepared at 500 \u25e6C. Such a dependence can be explained by the size effect and the degree of graphitization of the composite. For example, at a synthesis temperature of 700 \u25e6C, the largest nickel crystals with a size of 13 nm were detected. The mechanism of methane catalytic decomposition is described in detail in [103]. Obviously, a size-dependent catalytic effect is observed for this reaction. During the methane decomposition process and the growth of nanotubes, complex spatial structures are formed, which are difficult to form on small particles. This can explain the fixation of the maximum catalytic activity of the composite obtained at 500 \u25e6C with particle size of 4 nm. It is known [104] that during the process of catalytic decomposition of methane, carbon of various structures can be formed. In the case of using Ni composites for this process, carbon nanotubes were formed, the microphotographs of which are presented in Figure 13.

The composite synthesis was carried out with the directed formation of nanosized metallic nickel particles and the formation of a metallic nickel phase during the composite synthesis. The described approach made it possible to form nanosized metallic particles immobilized in a C-containing matrix with a narrow distribution of 5\u201315 nm. At the same time, some of the nickel-containing particles were partially encapsulated. The choice of the phase composition and size of the metallic component crystal was carried out with projection on the methane decomposition reaction.

Further detailed study of the process of nanotube growth on the described composite\nmaterial is of interest. It is possible that the process of nanotube growth in this case will proceed along routes different from the growth of nanotubes by the mechanism of carbon diffusion [103]. The partial carbon encapsulation of nickel particles in the composite material provides evidence for this assumption. It is possible that surface carbon may serve as a precursor for the nucleation of a carbon nanotube, the growth of which may occur by incorporating carbon fragments specifically on this catalytic surface.\nThe effects obtained provide a whole range of opportunities for further study of the properties and characteristics of such composite materials. The formation of metalcontaining composites with a narrow distribution of metallic particles is an extremely promising approach for synthesizing catalysts for structurally sensitive processes and processes with pronounced diffusion limitations.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.V.K., M.I.I. and V.O.S.; data curation, M.I.I. and A.E.S.; formal analysis, A.E.S.; funding acquisition, M.V.K. and V.O.S.; investigation, A.E.S.; methodology, M.I.I.; project administration, M.I.I.; resources, M.V.K. and V.O.S.; supervision, M.V.K.; visualization, A.E.S.; writing\u2014original draft, M.I.I. and A.E.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.V.K.
