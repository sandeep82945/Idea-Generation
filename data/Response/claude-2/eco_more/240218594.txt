 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the effectiveness of different public health interventions (e.g. mask mandates, business closures, etc.) on reducing COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates across regions with varying population densities. This could identify the most impactful policies for mitigating future pandemics. 

2. Conduct surveys or interviews to understand public attitudes and behaviors during lockdowns. This qualitative data could provide insights into why certain regions were more successful than others in adhering to lockdown policies and guidelines. 

3. Develop epidemiological models to simulate COVID-19 spread under different intervention scenarios (e.g. timing of lockdowns, travel restrictions, etc.). The models could be used to evaluate optimal pandemic response strategies.

4. Analyze genomic data of SARS-CoV-2 samples over time to understand how viral mutations affected transmissibility and health outcomes across regions. This could inform development of vaccines and therapeutics.

5. Examine the secondary effects of lockdowns on non-COVID health outcomes, educational attainment, unemployment, domestic violence, and other social factors. This could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the total population health impact of lockdowns and guide policies to mitigate any negative effects.
