    "abstractText": "Being a key technology for beyond fifth-generation wireless systems, joint communication and radar sensing (JCAS) utilizes the reflections of communication signals to detect foreign objects and deliver situational awareness. A cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is uniquely suited to form a mobile bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with its serving base station (BS) to sense over large areas with superb sensing resolutions at no additional requirement of spectrum. This paper designs this novel BS-UAV bistatic SAR platform, and optimizes the flight path of the UAV to minimize its propulsion energy and guarantee the required sensing resolutions on a series of interesting landmarks. A new trajectory planning algorithm is developed to convexify the propulsion energy and resolution requirements by using successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent. Effective trajectories are obtained with a polynomial complexity. Extensive simulations reveal that the proposed trajectory planning algorithm outperforms significantly its alternative that minimizes the flight distance of cellular-aided sensing missions in terms of energy efficiency and effective consumption fluctuation. The energy saving offered by the proposed algorithm can be as significant as 55%.",

INTRODUCTION\nRecent advancements in the fifth-generation and beyond (5G/B5G) networks are increasingly enabling extensive background situation- and position-aware smart applications, including autonomous driving, distant medical care, and smart industry [1]. 5G/B5G networks are also envisioned to offer high-resolution sensing in support of these applications [2]. For this reason, joint communication and radar sensing (JCAS) has been deemed as one of the essential technologies in 5G/B5G systems [3]. By integrating radio communication and sensing into a single system, JCAS measures the reflections of communication signals to sense the location, velocity, and feature signal of targets and motions [4], [5].

Neither of the GPS satellites and ground receivers sense the environment or deliver situational awareness, as opposed to JCAS [3].\nCellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been increasingly considered for their operability and applicability to UAV operations over wide areas [8], [9]. Apart from being an aerial user of communication services, a cellularconnected UAV can potentially utilize the cellular signals from corresponding base stations (BSs), and collect the echo signals from the ground (e.g., metallic) objects to perform radar sensing in areas covered by the BSs. Given the excellent mobility, the UAV can potentially form a bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with its serving BS to sense the environment. While dedicated sensing or radar techniques may detect objects with even better resolution (e.g., because of their wider signal bandwidth and higher signal power), they inevitably bring radio radiation and pollution [3]. Nevertheless, the UAVs are passive receivers, and neither increase the radio footprint of the system nor produce radio pollution.\nFig. 1 illustrates the new cellular-assisted radar sensing by a cellular-connected UAV, referred to as BS-UAV bistatic SAR sensing, where the reflections of the downlink cellular signals are picked up by the UAV and used to produce radio/radar images for object detection. Since the UAV is typically power-constrained, it is critical to carefully plan its trajectory to deliver energy-efficient radar sensing missions and extend mission time. Existing works have only designed the trajectory to minimize the UAV propulsion energy for wireless communication services, such as [10]\u2013[13]. None has considered the energy consumption in the new scenario of cellular-assisted radar sensing with a cellular-connected UAV."

            "text": "Existing studies of JCAS systems have typically focused on the beamforming design at the BSs, and have not considered the use of a UAV. These JCAS systems are in essence monostatic radars, which integrate the transmitter and receiver on the same platform. In [14], waveform design was optimized to confirm the produced signal to the expected sensing waveform subject to the signal-to-interference-andnoise ratio (SINR) requirement for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. In [15], globally optimal waveforms were devised for several expected sensing\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n13 23\n8v 1\n[ ee\nss .S\nY ]\n2 7\nJu l 2\n02 2\nbeam patterns to minimize multiuser interference. In [16], a multibeam technique was introduced for millimeter-wave (mmWave) JCAS with analog antenna arrays, and a fixed transmission subbeam was produced together with directionchanging scanning subbeams across various packets. In [17], a multi-metric waveform was designed for multiple-input singleoutput (MISO) communications to maximize the SINR at the users. On the other hand, a higher signal power is typically on demand for high-resolution sensing over long ranges, whereas the BSs usually have a limited transmit power. The sensing performance may considerably degrade if the targets are far away from the BS, because of the significant round-trip path loss attenuation of the echoed signals.\nUAVs have been emerging as a new type of passive receiver in bistatic radar systems. Unlike a monostatic radar, a bistatic radar uses geographically separated antennas for signal transmission and reception. The German TanDEM-X project (initiated in June 2010) developed the first prototype of a space-borne bistatic radar, relying on twin low-Earthorbiting (LEO) satellites traveling in near formation [18]. The High-Resolution Wide-Swath (HRWS) project was proposed to be the next-generation German space-borne radar platform for geological and geographical observation beyond 2030, by leveraging the formation movement of an active satellite and three passive satellites [19]. Mounted on mobile platforms, a bistatic SAR can perform HRWS sensing by making use of the relative movements between the SAR and the targets. The small-sized real antenna aperture can realize the capability of a larger aperture radar through data focusing and signal processing [20]. A clutter suppression and mobile target imaging strategy was developed in [21] for a GEO-LEO bistatic SAR system, which was robust against the quickly traveling object with the Doppler centroid ambiguity.\nWith a geosynchronous (GEO) SAR satellite as the transmitter, a UAV can receive the echo signals from terrestrial targets and achieve two-dimensional (2D) imaging. The flight path of the UAV receiver was planned in [22] for such a GEOUAV bistatic SAR system to sense rough terrains. A range model was developed in [23] to address the distinctiveness of the GEO-UAV bistatic SAR echo and the variations of the orbit positions of the GEO transmitter. A motion compensation algorithm was proposed in [24] for a mini-UAV-based bistatic SAR system to address the perturbation and spatial variance of the platform. However, none of the existing works [14]\u2013[24] have considered the BS-UAV bistatic SAR, as considered in this paper. None of the existing studies have considered the energy consumption of a UAV-based bistatic SAR system. The works in [22]\u2013[24] were focused on data focusing or image processing algorithms, where the geosynchronous satellites transmitted dedicated signals for ground object detection and did not transmit any data. The energy consumption of the UAV was not considered in [22] for trajectory planning, and the UAV trajectory design was not addressed in [23] and [24]. The results of [22]\u2013[24] cannot apply directly to a BS-UAV bistatic SAR system for energy-efficient trajectory design."

Given a series of landmarks to be sensed/observed, the UAV\u2019s trajectory is optimized to minimize its propulsion energy while satisfying the range and azimuth resolutions of sensing, thereby delivering energy-efficient BS-UAV bistatic SAR sensing missions and extending mission durations. This trajectory planning problem is non-convex because of the non-convexity of its objective function and constraints. We convexify the problem and obtain a quality solution efficiently by utilizing successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate descent (BCD).\nThe key contributions of the paper are listed as follows. \u2022 A novel BS-UAV bistatic SAR platform is proposed to\nreuse cellular downlink signals as excitation signals. A cellular-connected UAV receives the reflected signals and conducts radar sensing on landmarks. \u2022 The range and azimuth resolutions of the BS-UAV bistatic SAR are analyzed. An effective sensing area of the BSUAV bistatic SAR is established to effectively capture a landmark. \u2022 The UAV\u2019s trajectory is optimized to minimize its propulsion energy and ensure that all landmarks are captured in the effective sensing areas with the required range and azimuth sensing resolutions. By applying the SCA and BCD methods, a new algorithm is developed to deliver energy-efficient trajectories with a polynomial complexity.\nExtensive simulations corroborate that, in terms of energy efficiency and energy usage fluctuations, the proposed trajectory planning algorithm outperforms a baseline scheme that minimizes the flight distance of the UAV on the cellular-aided radar sensing mission. The proposed algorithm can save up to 55% of the UAV\u2019s propulsion energy, as compared to the baseline scheme.\nThe remainder of this paper is arranged as follows. Section II describes the system model. Section III formulates the UAV trajectory design problem for the BS-UAV bistatic SAR, and elaborates on the proposed trajectory planning algorithm. Performance evaluations are conducted in Section IV, followed by concluding remarks in Section V."

A cellular-connected UAV equipped with a side-looking SAR (receiver) flies and collects the echoes (or reflections) of the communication signals originated from the BS, to sense (metallic) objects and gain situational awareness; see Fig. 1. The signals are buffered at the UAV, and offloaded and post-processed (at the BS) after the sensing mission. Given the knowledge of the communication signals, the direct path from the BS to the UAV can be canceled. The remaining echo signals can be used to\nsense and decide the number and locations of the objects. In this way, the UAV can perform the sensing task by utilizing the communication signals, without the need of dedicated sensing signals, and thereby reduces the radio fingerprint and carbon emission.\nThe proposed UAV-based sensing platform is insusceptible to inter-cell interference, since it does not need to detect or decode data signals. The transmissions from other BSs can serve as additional illuminating sources to enhance the reflection on the objects. The UAV may utilize the pilot signals of the BSs to extract the reflections of objects [25]. With the knowledge of the pilot signals, the collected reflection signals by the UAV can be correlated to cancel the direct paths from any BSs and extract the reflections by the objects to detect the objects. Alternatively, the UAV may store the captured signals, and only start to process the signals after it returns from the mission and has access to the transmitted signals of the BSs. Then, correlation can be conducted between the captured signals and the transmitted signals to extract the reflections and detect the objects. On the other hand, the proposed trajectory planning algorithm can be performed at the UAV with limited assistance of the BSs. It only requires the information of the landmarks prior to the trajectory planning. The inter-cell interference has little impact on the algorithm, when the algorithm is in operation."

(10)\nIn order to distinguish the objects, the resolution of the SAR has to be finer than the shortest expected distance between any two objects, dmin, i.e., \u03b4tr \u2264 dmin and \u03b4ta \u2264 dmin. This resolution requirement is used to detect and differentiate different objects by leveraging the typically narrow signal bandwidths of cellular systems and, in turn, the poor resolution of sensing [32]. It is worth mentioning that we do not consider object identification in this paper, as it would require wider signal bandwidths to achieve better resolutions for detecting the shape of an object or even imaging the object [30]. Nevertheless, the proposed trajectory planning algorithm would still be relevant under a wider signal bandwidth and correspondingly\na finer resolution requirement. The algorithm is generic and suitable for different resolution requirements.\nConsidering the characteristics of the side-looking SAR, the cosine of the UAV elevation angle is\ncos \u03b7 \u2248 LAE Wg \u2248 \u03b8vRm Wg \u2248 \u03bbcRm WaWg , (11)\nwhere Rm is the slant range (distance) from the SAR antenna to the center of Ut (i.e., point C); Wa is the height of the SAR antenna, and Wg is the SAR range extent, i.e., the width of the ground swath covered by the SAR beam, to the right of the UAV; and the vertical beamwidth of the SAR is \u03b8v = \u03bbc/Wa. The azimuth angular spread is \u03b8a = \u03bbc/La, with La being the antenna length parallel to the direction of the UAV\u2019s heading. This spread is due to the interference of the waves emitted from and received by the dipoles of the antenna [33].\nThe effective sensing area is ellipsoidal, denoted by Ut. The ellipsoidal effective sensing area is significantly smaller than the coverage area of the BS, A, and is used to sample different parts of the coverage area for object detection. The major and minor axes of the ellipsoidal sensing area, Ut, are Wg =\n\u03bbcRm Wa cos \u03b7 and \u03b8a = \u03bbc/La, respectively. We can obtain from Fig. 2 that Rm = H/ cos \u03b7. Therefore, at any moment, the size of the effective sensing area Ut, i.e., S, is\nS = \u03c0 4 \u00d7 \u03bbc La \u00d7 \u03bbcH Wa cos2 \u03b7 . (12)\nGiven the range and azimuth resolutions of the SAR, and the center and size of the effective sensing area, the BSUAV bistatic SAR can efficiently sense, detect, and distinguish ground objects in the disk region while the UAV is flying.

Problems (14) and (18) are equivalent. The reason is that, if (18b) holds with inequality for any t, one could always diminish the value of the relevant variable qt to save the overall power until (18b) takes equality [10].\nProblem (18) is still non-convex due to the non-convex constraint (18b), and nevertheless can be resolved with the SCA approach [34] through determining the global lower limit of (18b) at a specified local point. Specifically, the left-hand side (LHS) of (18b) exhibits convexity in qt, and the RHS exhibits convexity in {qt, Vt}. Because the first-order Taylor expansion acts as a global lower limit of a convex function [35], we can attain the lower limit for the RHS of (18b), as given by:\nq2t + Vt\n2\nv20 \u2265 q(`)2t +\n1\nv20 V\n(`) t\n2 + 2q\n(`) t ( qt \u2212 q(`)t ) + 2\nv20 V\n(`) t ( Vt \u2212 V (`)t ) ,\n(19)\nwhere q(`)t and V (`) t are the respective values of the variables at the `-th iteration of the SCA method. We proceed to convexify constraints (14b) and (14f), since the other constraints (14c)-(14e) are all convex by now. This starts by rewriting (14b) as\nsin \u03b8t \u2265 c\nBdmin \u2212 sin \u03b7.

            "text": "This section provides the simulation results of the proposed trajectory planning algorithm for BS-UAV bistatic SAR using MATLAB. The entire sensing period lasts T = 300 s with each time slot of \u03b4 = 0.5 s, unless stated otherwise. The default setting of the landmarks (and associated sensing time) is a series of points with the first 15 of them, i.e., when t \u2264 150 s, along the y-axis starting from (0, 0), and the rest along the x-axis starting from q16g . The adjacent landmarks are apart for an equal distance. The UAV initial location is q0 = [\u22121000,\u2212500]T m. The BS is located at qb = [1000,\u22121000]T m, with the height Hb = 50 m. The other parameters concerning the BS-UAV bistatic SAR sensing performance and the UAV propulsion power are provided in Table I.\nWe note that the standard sub-6 GHz band has been extensively deployed to provide broad 5G coverage, where the antennas are typically horizontally or quasi-horizontally oriented in the sub-6 GHz band [32]. The transmission bandwidth is typically narrow in the sub-6 GHz band, e.g., up to 100 MHz,\nand consequently the range resolution could be poor [38]. Nevertheless, a bandwidth of 150 MHz can be achieved in a standard sub-6 GHz band by using carrier aggregation techniques [39]. For instance, China Mobile deployed a 4G and 5G concurrent integrated network supporting a transmission bandwidth of up to 160 MHz at the 2.6 GHz band in 2019 [40]. On the other hand, the 5G new radio (NR) has also specified the use of mmWave bands. The propagation of mmWave signals can be limited within a close range of the BS, subject to antenna orientation (i.e., downtilt) [32]. Nevertheless, the signals can still be reflected by objects (e.g., with smooth metallic surfaces) or the edges of objects [41], [42], and captured by the UAV. Given the quasi-optical property of mmWave signals [43], the ground reflections (and reflections by other non-smooth surfaces, e.g., walls, vegetation, etc.) are\nexpected to be substantially weaker, resulting in strong contrast to manifest objects [43].\nWe also note that no existing studies have addressed the problem of energy-efficient trajectory design for the considered UAV-based bistatic SAR system, as discussed in Section I-A. In other words, no existing algorithm is directly comparable to the proposed algorithm. With due diligence, we come up with a new baseline scheme for the considered problem, which minimizes the total flight distance of the UAV without considering the energy consumption of the UAV, i.e., minqt \u2211 t \u2016qt\u2016. The baseline has a convex objective function, while its constraints can be convexified in the same way as done in Algorithm 1.\nFig. 3(a) shows the expected shortest distance between any two objects in the area, dmin, versus the radius of the given area A, R (in meters), when there are N = 800, 1000 or 1200 objects in A. It can be seen that dmin increases with R, given the number of objects in the area; i.e., the objects\nare more sparsely distributed when the area is larger. When R = 5000 m, the expected shortest distance between any two objects in the area dmin is about 20 m. Therefore, we choose the value of dmin = 20 m. Fig. 3(b) depicts the convergence of the proposed scheme when the landmarks are separated by 30 m and 200 m under two settings. It can be seen that the objective function of problem (27), i.e., (27a), can quickly converge within about only 20 iterations. When the two neighboring landmarks are apart for a longer distance, the UAV consumes less energy and shows better energy efficiency. This is because the UAV can move faster, and the propulsion power first decreases and then increases at the increasing speed of the UAV, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Fig. 3(c) plots the UAV power consumption Pt in (6) by varying the instantaneous speed of a rotary-wing UAV from 0 m/s to 70 m/s. The UAV\u2019s propulsion power is independent of its trajectory and heading. The UAV consumes the least power when its speed is about 35 m/s, validating the results in Fig. 3(b).\nFig. 4 shows the per-slot energy consumption of the rotarywing UAV conducting the BS-UAV bistatic SAR sensing under the proposed and baseline schemes, where the default setting of the landmarks is considered, i.e., with an equal distance of 30 m or 200 m between adjacent landmarks. It is revealed that the minimization of the flight distance does not necessarily lead to the minimization of the UAV\u2019s energy consumption. When the landmarks are separated by 30 m, the proposed scheme can save 55% of the total energy, as compared to the baseline.\nIt is interesting to notice that the baseline scheme is better than the proposed algorithm in terms of per-slot UAV power consumption when t \u2264 50 s and the spacing between adjacent landmarks is 30 m. This is because the objective of the proposed algorithm, i.e., (14a), is to minimize the total energy consumption. As a result, the algorithm has the UAV fly slowly away from a landmark (while still keeping the landmark within its effective sensing area) at the beginning of the sensing mission to benefit the later stage of the mission in Fig. 4. The\nUAV has to restrain its speed at the beginning of the mission at the cost of high energy consumption, as will be shown in Fig. 5. On the other hand, the baseline scheme requires the UAV to fly fast towards the landmarks in the beginning and then slows down, to minimize the total flight distance to sense all landmarks. As a result, the baseline scheme consumes less energy than the proposed algorithm at the beginning of the mission. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm is much more energy-efficient when the entire mission is considered.\nFigs. 5 and 6 plot the UAV trajectory (the red dash line with triangle markers) and its sensing performance under the proposed and baseline schemes. The black and magenta circles provide some examples of the effective sensing areas at different time slots. The green triangle shows the location of the BS. We see in Figs. 5 and 6 that the UAV can always capture the landmarks within its sensing area at the time slots required. Under the proposed schemes, the UAV seeks an energy-efficient flight path, and is better adapted to the distribution of the landmarks. In contrast, under the baseline schemes, the UAV first catches up with the nearest landmark at its highest speed, and then flies at a relatively stable speed to satisfy the resolution requirements. This can cause drastic changes in the instantaneous power consumption of the UAV under the baseline method, as already shown in Fig. 4.\nFig. 7 plots the UAV trajectory when T = 600 s. The landmarks are separated by 30 m and distributed in a staircase (that is, two street blocks situated along a diagonal). The effective sensing area of the BS-UAV bistatic SAR is indicated by the black, magenta, or green circles, when t = 10 s, 250 s, 350 s, 450 s, and 590 s, respectively. It is shown in Fig. 7 that the BS-UAV bistatic SAR can always capture the landmarks in its sensing coverage at the required time slots.\nFig. 8 plots the UAV trajectory when the landmarks are separated by 100 m and distributed in a square (e.g., a closed loop around a triangular street block), T = 600 s, and H = 1000 m (Fig. 8(a)) or 1200 m (Fig. 8(b)). The effective sensing area of the BS-UAV bistatic SAR is shown when t = 10 s, 170 s, 300 s, 320 s, 450 s, and 530 s, under the UAV elevation of H = 1000 m, and when t = 10 s, 220 s, 440 s, and 580 s, under the UAV elevation of H = 1200 m. It is observed that the UAV intends to fly around the landmarks for both effective sensing and energy saving. The UAV trajectory of the corresponding baseline scheme is shown in Fig. 8(b) when H = 1200 m; see the green dashed line with circle markers. The effective sensing area of the UAV is illustrated when t = 250 s. We see that the UAV takes a much shorter flight\npath around the landmarks to satisfy the sensing resolution requirements, which is at the cost of a much higher propulsion energy consumption, as to be shown in Fig. 9.\nFig. 9 plots the per-slot energy consumption of the proposed scheme when the landmarks are distributed in a staircase (i.e., the two diagonally situated street blocks) or a square (i.e., the closed loop of a triangular street block), with the spacing of 30 m and 100 m, respectively. Here, T = 600 s, and H = 1000 m or 1200 m. We see that the UAV consumes less energy when the landmark spacing or the UAV altitude is larger, as the UAV embraces more flexibility to design an energy-efficient trajectory and meet the sensing requirements. The per-slot energy consumption of the baseline approach is also plotted for the landmarks arranged on the square with the spacing of 100 m, and the UAV elevation is H = 1200 m. We see that the proposed scheme consumes dramatically lower energy than the baseline, and prevents drastic fluctuations in the per-slot consumption of the UAV propulsion energy.\nFig. 10 plots the UAV trajectory and per-slot energy consumption of the proposed and baseline schemes, when the spacing between neighboring landmarks obeys a random uniform distribution within [0, 100] m. The averaged results of 20 independent realizations of the landmark locations are plotted. While the UAV flies a longer distance under the proposed algorithm than it does under the baseline approach as shown in the top of the figure, the energy consumption is substantially lower and undergoes much smaller fluctuations under the proposed algorithm as shown in the bottom of the figure. This again corroborates the merits of the proposed scheme over\nthe baseline scheme in terms of energy efficiency and energy consumption fluctuation.\nLast but not least, we examine the performance of the proposed BS-UAV bistatic SAR under different transmission bandwidths B in the sub-6 GHz band and the mmWave band. Table II shows the range resolutions of the SAR, where B is 50 MHz, 100 MHz, and 150 MHz at the sub-6 GHz band, and 200 MHz at the mmWave band. Here, \u03b8t is assumed to be \u03c0/3. We see that the resolutions are always better than the expected shortest distance between any two objects, dmin; in other words, the SAR can effectively distinguish ground objects. Fig. 11 shows the UAV trajectory by the proposed and baseline schemes, where the landmarks are separated by 200 m, and the transmission bandwidth B is 50 MHz and 100 MHz. The other settings are consistent with those in Fig. 6. By comparing Fig. 11 to Fig. 6, we see that the UAV trajectory has similar patterns while satisfying the sensing accuracy."

            "text": "This paper proposed a novel framework of cellular-aided radar sensing with a BS-UAV bistatic SAR platform. The trajectory of the UAV was optimized to minimize the propulsion energy while satisfying the range and azimuth resolutions of sensing. The trajectory planning problem was convexified and solved efficiently by utilizing the SCA and BCD methods. Extensive simulations revealed that, in terms of energy efficiency and effective consumption fluctuation, the proposed trajectory planning algorithm is superior to its alternative that minimizes the flight distance of a cellular-aided sensing mission. The energy saving can be as large as 55% for the UAV, by running the proposed algorithm. In the future, we will extend the BS-UAV bistatic SAR system to a fixed-wing UAV-based platform, where a more sophisticated propulsion energy model and dynamic/mobility model will be taken into account."
