It was conducted using PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Springer Link, Clinical Trials, and Web of Science etc. The Van Tulder Scale was utilized in randomized trials research, whereas the dawn and black checklists were used in non-randomized trials research. A descriptive and numerical analysis of selected research was done. The scope of eligible PCs, pharmaceutical implementers, study outcomes, and quality were all identified by a thematic review of research.\nResults There were about 431,753 citations found in this study, and 129 publications were found to be eligible for inclusion after analysing more than 271 full-text papers. The study design was varied, with 43 (33.3%) RCTs and 86 (66.7%) n-RCTs. Thirty-three (25.6%) of the studies were published in 2020. Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey were home to the majority of the studies (25.6%, 16.3%, and 11.6%) respectively. Thirty-seven studies (19.7%) were concerned with resolving drug related problems (DRPs), whereas 27 (14.4%) were concerned with increasing quality of life (QOL) and 23 (12.2%) with improving drug adherence. Additionally, the research revealed that the average ratings of the activities provided to patients improved every year.\nConclusion Studies in the Middle East continue to provide evidence supporting the positive impact of pharmaceutical care services on both hard and soft outcomes measured in most studies. Yet there was rare focus on the value of the implemented services. Thus, rigorous evaluation of the economic impact of implemented pharmaceutical care services in the Middle East and assessment of their sustainability is must.\nKeywords Assessment, Clinical pharmacy services, Middle East, Pharmaceutical Care Services, Pharmacy practice"

            "text": "Despite the fact that pharmaceutical care (PC) has evolved into a whole philosophy and a standard for providing health care as a result of pharmacy organizations\u2019 continuing professional development programs around the world [1], the importance of pharmaceutical care services and the implementation of pharmacy practice research has not been clearly defined in the Middle East countries so that independent observers can detect its presence, strength, and sustainability [2].\nIn general, because of disparities in training programs, healthcare systems, and regulatory frameworks, the state of pharmacy practice in the Middle Eastern differs among various nations. However, because of the near vicinity of the two locations, the same language, culture, and history, there are many parallels in terms of practicing facilitators and barriers [3].\nA more modern definition of Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE), which specifies pharmaceutical care as a service provided by pharmacists, states: Pharmaceutical Care is that the pharmacist\u2019s contribution to the care of people is to optimize the use of medicines and improve health outcomes [4].\nThe pharmacist\u2019s roles in patient care have expanded from the traditional tasks of dispensing medications and providing basic medication counseling to working with other health care professionals and the general community. This has resulted greater in the pharmacist\u2019s participation in different health care systems involving in/ out-patients pharmacies, general medical practices, and hospitals [5]. Six papers from Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Sudan, and Iraq were found in a systematic review looking at pharmacists\u2019 intervention programs for diabetic patients in these Arab nations. These trials revealed considerable gains in patients\u2019 knowledge, adherence, and therapeutic results [6].\nOn the other hand, another systematic review looked at how people felt about the role and offerings of community pharmacists in Arabic-speaking Middle Eastern nations, showing the widespread belief that these professionals offer services that are business-oriented. It was also observed that the public\u2019s impression of the pharmacist\u2019s involvement in clinically oriented services was poor [3].\nThe pharmacy profession has been thriving in the Middle East. In Jordan, we found that the number of community pharmacies has surpassed 2200, and the active workforce is anticipated to include 12,000 registered pharmacists. In Jordan, pharmaceutical care services are highly developed in recent years, resulting in improved patient outcomes and therapy management in different medical conditions and healthcare settings [7\u201310].\nAnother systematic review analyzed suggestions for program creation and looked at how antimicrobial\nstewardship methods affected prescribing practices and antibiotic appropriateness in the Middle East. Giving clinical pharmacists a more prominent role in the administration and prescription of antibiotics was one of the recommendations made by Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon [11].\nAlthough the benefits of pharmaceutical care interventions by pharmacists within various healthcare settings have been documented in the literature, particularly in systematic reviews, [12\u201317] there is a need to evaluate the impact holistically through a multidimensional assessment of clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes [18].\nIdentifying these issues can help in determining what factors impede or facilitate intervention, the development of solutions to overcome process obstacles, the introduction of innovations into health systems, or the promotion of their widespread usage and sustainability [19]. Implementation research may be a crucial method for ensuring the successful adoption and sustainability of Clinical Pharmacy Services (CPS) in countries where they have not yet been established [20\u201322].\nHowever, Pew Health Profession Commission (PHPC) recommended that pharmaceutical education \u201cshould begin with a curricular reform to be qualified to perform pharmaceutical care\u201d [23]. By looking at the educational side of the Middle East region, some studies showed that some of the universities who nationally certified for pharmacy schools have international accreditation from recognized pharmacy authorities [24].\nAccording to a study of the current state of PCs services in a number of Arabic-speaking Middle East (ME) countries, the pharmaceutical care concept has only recently been introduced to many (ME) countries, and is still frequently confused with clinical pharmacy, which remains a priority in several countries of the region. In many Middle Eastern nations, pharmacy education is undergoing rapid transition and some pharmacy institutions have launched or plan to introduce the Pharm.D degree to replace the traditional Bachelor of Pharmaceutical Science degree. These improvements are expected to reflect a greater understanding and implementation of pharmaceutical care in various forms, such as medication management services, in hospital and community settings [25].\nThese services will not only help in determining and approving the critical tasks of pharmacists or clinical pharmacists aid or improving the implementation of Pharmaceutical Care services, but will also increase collaboration between pharmacists and other health care providers. Therefore, the purpose of this search investigation was to answer the following research question:\n1. Does pharmaceutical Care Services optimize rational use of medicine?"

            "text": "Many pharmaceutical care services that have been covered by clinical pharmacists or pharmacists have been identified in various aspects. Getting back to the key aim of this review, thirty-three of the studies conducted in different Middle East Countries including Jordan (22.2%, n = 8), Cyprus (8.3%, n = 3), Israel (2.8%, n = 1), Qatar (8.3%, n = 2), Saudi Arabia (8.3%, n = 3), Oman (2.8%, n = 1.3), Turkey (25%, n = 7), Egypt (11.1%, n = 4), Iran (5.6%, n = 2) and Lebanon (5.6%, n = 2) showed how the clinical pharmacists/ pharmacists play a fundamental role to assess the patient\u2019s medications treatment from different aspects and different unites in the hospital which is facilitating the treatment control and enhancing therapy outcomes. Also, further studies [28\u201330] showed a great acceptance of physicians for clinical pharmacists\u2019\nrecommendations regarding their intervention in identifying drug-related problems. The intervention of clinical pharmacists in reducing and identifying drug-related problems resulted in a significant impact in detecting drug problems and preventing harm [31\u201335]. While one study conducted in Turkey highlighted that despite the non- properly implementation of clinical pharmacy services, clinical pharmacists have a high rate of acceptance in recommending DRPs in a wide variety [36].\nIn a community, pharmacists are the most accessible health care provider. As a result, they are in a position to detect chronic diseases early on and identify unhealthy behaviors. When appropriate, they can assist patient\u2019s lower risk factors by providing prevention counseling, such as weight and food control, exercise, and quitting smoking [1]. As a result, we investigated\n21.2% of research that examined the role of a clinical pharmacist or a pharmacist in managing, regulating, and enhancing a patient\u2019s health. Clinical pharmacists/ pharmacists have a considerable impact on monitoring\nand maintaining clinical parameters of diabetic patients, according to 8.3% of studies in the field [37\u201344]. Respectively, we found that 6.8% of the studies focused on the positive role of pharmacists/ clinical pharmacists in different diseases such as metabolic syndrome, Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), iron deficiency anemia and others [45\u201353].\nFurthermore, 2.3% of the studies related to the managing of Cardio Vascular Diseases [54\u201356](CVDs), while 2.3% of the studies focused on the intervention on patients with Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKDs) [10, 57, 58] and 1.5% of the studies described the implementation of PCs in patients with respiratory diseases such as asthma [59, 60]. All of them substantiated that pharmacists/ clinical pharmacists are an essential part of the health care team to provide early detection of chronic diseases, managing associated complications, and how the physicians strongly recommended the importance of integrating the pharmaceutical care services.\nAccording to PCNE, each problem can have many causes, with each problem having a maximum of three causes [61]. The classification will be used in research into the nature, prevalence, and incidence of DRPs, as well as in experimental studies of Pharmaceutical Care outcomes as a process indicator. It\u2019s also designed to make it easier for healthcare workers to keep track of DRP data during the pharmaceutical treatment process. Lack of knowledge about medications, lack of adherence to medications, suboptimal efficacy of medications prescribed, untreated conditions, selection of doses, inadequate training, lack of space for counseling, and the need for additional monitoring were all identified as DRPs that could affect the sustainability of PCs and the progression of chronic diseases in some of the included studies [10, 58, 62].\nPatient education, medication adherence, and improvement in QoL/ HRQoL Regarding the role of pharmacists/ clinical pharmacists in counselling, educating, enhancing medications used, and improving (QOL) of the patients, we found that 41.4% of the studies showed their great impact, well-defined education, care that is helping to improve the outcomes of the patients and increase their desire to counsel, complete their medications appropriately and the positive impact of counselling not only on medication use but to\ndevelop a variety of strategies to improve compliance too. Where the percentage of studies that focused on increasing adherence to the use of the drug was 17.3%, 21.1% were focused mainly on the role of pharmacists/ clinical pharmacists in educating and counselling, and 20.3% on their effective role in improving the quality of life of the patients. Besides, some studies demonstrated that comprehensive educational intervention might improve the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions among pharmacists and encourage them to incorporate and participate in this into their everyday clinical practice."

In addition, following the pharmacist\u2019s guidance and recommendations resulted in a considerable drop in mortality. A study conducted by Muath Fahmi Najjar, suggested that the intervention of clinical pharmacists would raise the significance value of their intervention to improve the prescription patterns among hospitalized patients [63]. Moreover, another study linked the intervention of a clinical pharmacist to the reduction of hospitalization, thus reducing the high cost that the patient may incur as a result of re-admission to the hospital [64]."

This research found that clinical pharmacists have a considerable impact on drug therapy costs, as well as reducing inappropriate prescription use at admission and improving medication review services. Clinical pharmacist interventions did not significantly reduce patients\u2019 direct drug costs, according to a study by Hossein Khalili, [65]. Clinical pharmacist intervention has a considerable impact on the cost of pharmacological therapy and patient outcomes, according to a study conducted by Huda, [66]. The findings back up the value of pharmacological therapy for all hospitalized CVD patients. A retrospective study had done by Elif Ertuna, despite clinical pharmacy services still not properly implemented in Turkey; there\u2019s a high acceptance rate of pharmacist recommendations in interdisciplinary geriatric assessment teams [36]. Based on the results conducted in a reference center in Iran, the implementation of guidelines by the pharmaceutical supply unit significantly reduced the consumption of albumin and IV pantoprazole and decreased their direct costs [67].\nAs a result of the continually high cost of pharmaceuticals, Pharmacoeconomics evaluation studies are becoming increasingly important [68]. These studies allow for the identification, measurement, and comparison of the expenses of various pharmacotherapies or services, as well as the assessment of their impact on health budgets and patient health.\nBarriers hinder pharmaceutical care services One of the goals that ensure continued Pharmaceutical Services is to secure patient satisfaction for services provided by either the pharmacist or the pharmacist\u2019s clinical. Two studies [69, 70] showed that all the patients considered counseling as an important service and were satisfied with it and how pharmacist with skills in pharmaceutical care and counseling could be useful in promoting the service and making it profitable for the pharmacy business as shown too in this study that all the participants had a positive perception of the pharmaceutical care services.\nMoreover, pharmacists/ clinical pharmacists may face some barriers and challenges to provide pharmacy practice, so different studies [71\u201373] demonstrated that time constraint\u2019 was the primary barrier discouraging pharmacists from practicing such service, inconvenient access to patient medical information (78%) and lack of staff and time (77 and 74% respectively) and research experience for the pharmacists who have no prior experience to do research.\nAs a result, two studies concluded that collaboration among many stakeholders in the profession is critical to supporting pharmacists\u2019 attempts to change the scope of pharmacy practice in order to improve patient care services. Furthermore, from undergraduate studies to residency training, pharmacy practice implementation is influenced by the entire educational process [73, 74]."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The current research is the first to examine the impact of PCs on Middle Eastern low- and middle-income countries.\nOnly 129 articles were included in this scoping review. However, all included studies have been published from 2013 to 2020. The massive majority of studies were from Jordan, with the largest number of published studies (25.6%, n = 33), followed by Saudi Arabia (16.3%, n = 21), Turkey (11.6%, n = 15), Iran (10.9%, n = 14) then Egypt (9.3%, n = 12), Qatar (6.2%, n = 8), Cyprus (5.4%, n = 7), Iraq (4.7%, n = 6) and Kuwait (3.1%, n = 4) While Lebanon and Palestine (2.3%, n = 3), next Israel and Oman (1.6%, n = 2 and 0.8%, n = 1, respectively). Based on the World Bank Classification of countries by income level 2019\u20132020 (World Bank Data 2020), we found thirteen Middle East Countries. Six of them were identified as Middle-Income countries including Jordan, Iran, Egypt, Iraq, and Turkey, six countries considered as High income representing in Qatar, Cyprus, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Oman, and one country Palestine was considered a Low-income country.\nMost of the studies included in this review reported the effective role of pharmacist/ clinical pharmacists in improving HRQoL/ QoL. This finding is also compatible with results from previous studies, which showed significant value and the positive impact of pharmacists on the QoL among older adult patients in rural areas[75]. Moreover, a study conducted in 2014 recited a statistical improvement in the HRQoL after pharmaceutical care intervention[76]. A review supports this systematic review was carried on women with breast cancer (BC) in the Middle East countries [77]. A cross-sectional study conducted by Jordanian pharmacists to determine the predictors, levels, and prevalence of anxiety and stress, as well as the relationship between these factors and quality of life in recently displaced Iraqis, discovered that pharmacists play an important role in reducing anxiety and stress among refugees. Reducing and managing anxiety and stress may help refugees around the world improve their quality of life [78]. While we found that some studies have traded different services that can be provided by pharmacists or clinical pharmacists. Majdoleen AL Alawneh, showed that the medication review service provided by professional pharmacists can enhance DRPs and anxiety ratings, according to this study [79].\nSimilar results were found in different studies. Pharmacists are capable of assisting patients in improving their health by lowering drug-related side effects and increasing medication adherence, as well as reducing physician visits, and hospital admissions, and changing the primary care delivery system as a whole [80]. A systematic review correlated to pharmacist- led DM self-management Education (DSME) studies also indicated a significant improvement in medication adherence, quality of life, and diabetes knowledge after DSME [81].\nIn a systematic review of non-dispensing pharmaceutical services in low- and middle-income countries, Pande et al. (2013) found that \u201cpharmaceutical care\u201d was the most prevalent language used in the studies, and the majority of the interventions involved simple patient education [82].\nAlthough the main services were implemented either more specific, such as improving HRQoL/QoL, managing and controlling diseases, increasing medication adherence, resolving DRPs, or TRPs. The effectiveness of CPS delivered in primary care clinics was evaluated in a systematic review, and the majority of the complex and comprehensive interventions, such as physical assessment, monitoring, prescribing, and face-to-face communication with physicians, were conducted in high-income countries [83]. Undoubtedly, the majority of congestive heart disease (CHD) seems to be closely related to abnormal BP, diabetes, and dyslipidemia [84], in which several studies have been shown the effective role of pharmacists in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with CHD, as well as numerous articles have been identified that cooperation, especially cooperation between physicians and pharmacists, can effectively reduce the incidence of drug-related problems and improve outcomes very favorably in some clinical situations [85\u201387].\nThe need for knowledgeable, proficient, and experienced healthcare practitioners has grown year after year and the role of a clinical pharmacist has expanded to encompass all phases of patient care as part of the healthcare team. A study looking at physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants estimated a shortage of qualified oncology and Hematology practitioners by 2020 [88]. Because of their special knowledge and extensive training, oncology pharmacists are perfectly positioned to deliver high-quality care to cancer patients and offset some of the shortage of practitioners [89]. Another study conducted in the Hematological and Has Unit revealed that the inclusion of a clinical pharmacist in the hemodialysis unit resulted in the detection and treatment of several DRPs. The majority of the interventions were important, and they may have resulted in improved therapeutic outcomes [90]. Additionally, other studies conducted in diabetes clinics have documented the diabetes management of patients whose drug therapy was managed specifically by clinical pharmacists under physician supervision. The studies showed consistent, favorable results on\nglycemic control in the university-affiliated out-patient clinic, Veterans Affairs medical centers, and managed care settings [91\u201394].\nThe existence, accessibility, and inference of hospital pharmacists need to be improved, and physicians should be more aware of what they can offer, as shown in our scoping review. Qualitative semi-structured interviews revealed that the presence, visibility, and implication of hospital pharmacists need to be improved, and physicians should be more aware of what they can offer, according to qualitative semistructured interviews. As a result, trust is one of the most important factors for improving physician\u2013pharmacist collaboration, as numerous studies discovered [95\u201397]. Trust is critical for physician\u2013pharmacist collaboration and has been linked to greater commitment and dialogue.\nAccording to our analysis, we attempted to identify elements that could either encourage or hinder the introduction of pharmaceutical care services in Middle Eastern countries. Hence, we found only a few studies that reported some factors, including a limited number of clinical pharmacists, lack of cooperation between pharmacists/ clinical pharmacists and health care professionals, low variable socioeconomic status, and lack of expert and trained pharmacists. A study reported that the identification of barriers and facilitators of implementation is one among the foremost important and feasible strategies to implement change. Therefore, the identification of influencing factors employing a framework, like APOTECA, could guide the development of a multifaceted, multilevel tailored plan, using implementation strategy tools, to a successful implementation of CPS [98].\nThe cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical care interventions aims either to reduce medication errors or to reduce the cost of medication-related morbidity and mortality. As a result, there is a great opportunity for pharmacists to have a significant impact on reducing healthcare costs because they have the expertise to identify, correct, and prevent medication errors and medication-related problems. For this reason, two studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of clinical pharmacists providing services in a general practice (GP) [99, 100]. Pharmacist intervention dominated, decreased costs, and improved health outcomes, according to the Canadian Cancer Society in Canada [101]. In a study conducted in the United Kingdom, pharmacist intervention was found to be more cost-effective than conventional care [102].\nBecause not all Middle Eastern countries were covered in the scoping review, there are certain limitations on how far the influence of pharmaceutical care services may be generalized. Additionally, we were unable to examine pharmaceutical care services in various Middle Eastern nations due to a lack of research and other nations\u2019 rejection of interventions. While some research emphasized the value of cost-effectiveness, the majority of studies conducted in the\nMiddle East did not, which may be one of the challenges to accessing pharmaceutical therapy.\nTo sum up, this scoping review showed that Clinical pharmacist\u2019s/ pharmacists\u2019 interventions in different general practices have a significant role in improving healthcare outcomes, including QoL, medication adherence, mortality rate, hospital readmission, and hospitalization, reviewing patients\u2019 medication discrepancies, and DRPs. These data can be used to design a strategy that identifies the factors that assure the continuation of pharmaceutical services as well as the issues that hinder this continuity. Furthermore, it may be possible to provide these services in nations where Pharmaceutical Care Services are not unified, thus consider including them.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. org/10.1186/s12889-023-16199-1.\nSupplementary Material 1\nAcknowledgements Many thanks and appreciations go to people who have willingly helped out with their abilities.\nAuthor contributions All authors reviewed the manuscript.\nFunding Not applicable.\nData Availability The datasets used and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request."
