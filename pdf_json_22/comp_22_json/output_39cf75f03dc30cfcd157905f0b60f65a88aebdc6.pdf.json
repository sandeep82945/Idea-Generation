INTRODUCTION\nWhen the vehicle is driving on different road conditions, the posture and position of the engine changes in real time with the bumps of the vehicle. Its posture and position are\nmainly divided into three states of pitch, roll and vertical motion. This state will be more obvious when the vehicle is running in a harsh environment. The long-term exposure of the engine to a harsh working environment will increase the probability of engine malfunction. The engine malfunction mainly include lubrication system failure, oil supply system failure and cooling system failure, etc [1]. In order to reduce the possibility of engine malfunction, the engine must be strictly tested before leaving the factory.The traditional engine experiment consumes a lot of financial, human and material resources. It also has the disadvantages of long experiment time and poor effect. Therefore, the indoor testing technology of engine [2] has become a research hotspot.\nIn order to ensure that the indoor test results of the engine are consistent with the road test results. It is necessary to truly reproduce the actual vehicle road conditions. In the\nengine performance test, the dynamic test method of rotating along two axes, or the static test of tilting the engine at a certain angle is used. However, the motion of the vehicle body is the coupling of multiple degrees of freedom(DOF).\nThe above test methods are difficult to match with the actual motion of the vehicle [3,4]. The 6-DOF PM and 2R1T PM are used to simulate the motion of vehicles. In 1985, the German Dailem-Benz company developed the world's first motion simulator with 6-DOF [5-6]. BMW company [7] and Renault company [8] in Europe developed full-scale 6-DOF motion simulators in 2003 and 2004, respectively. In 2003, the university of Iowa developed the largest and most advanced driving simulator NADS-I with 12-DOF at that time [9]. The stewart structure of the simulator is installed on the horizontal and vertical guide rails. It can realize complex vehicle road interaction in both horizontal and vertical\ndirections. In 2006, the University of Leeds [10] developed a UoLDS driving simulator with 8-DOF. In 2008, the Toyota Higashi Fuji Technical Center developed a driving simulator with a height of 4.5 m and an inner diameter of 7 m. It\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

In 2010, Daimler-Benz developed a driving simulator with 7-DOF, a height of about 4.5 m and an inner diameter of about 7.5 m [12]. Dai et al. [13] investigated the motion control of a Stewart parallel robot with uncertain load. Then a novel motion control method is designed with the aim of reducing the effect of the load disturbances. Lafmejani et al. [14] proposed a discrete multi-segment model in which each segment is a 6-DoF parallel platform. Tong et al. [15] presented a class of modified stewart platform PMs with line orthogonality. Qiang et al. [16] presented a fast and accurate method to maintain the angle of manipulator and effectively resist wave interference. Tang et al. [17] proposed an\nimproved 3-DOF parallel vehicle motion simulation platform based on the 3-RPS PM . The platform can simulate three DOF of pitch, roll and vertical motion. Song et al. [18] proposed a new 2R1T 3-RSR parallel motion simulator. The mechanism has the characteristics without parasitic motion, and can rotate continuously around any axis of the mid-plane.\nReferences [5] to [18] propose some mechanism configurations that can be used for motion simulation, including a 6-DOF setwart PM and a 2R1T PM that can simulate engine pitch, roll, and vertical vibration. These papers provide theoretical basis for the configuration design of motion simulation platform.\nCurrently, most 6-DOF parallel motion simulators are based on the stewart platform[19]. It has the disadvantages of small working space, coupling of DOF, complex control, and large footprint. In most cases, the simulation effect of the 3-DOF motion platform and the 6-DOF motion platform is equivalent[20]. The lower-mobility PM has the advantages of simple structure, less driving, low cost and so on. In most practical projects, 3-DOF are enough to meet the application requirements. However, lower-mobility will also cause new problems. The number of branches becomes less, and the bearing capacity decreases. Moreover, 2R1T PM often has parasitic motion in the movement process. It is not conducive to the research of mechanism control and trajectory planning. The above mechanism is used for the\nengine tilt test. The test bench road spectrum reproduction accuracy is low. And the test result is not accurate. Chen et al. [21] proposed a 3-UPU PM without parasitic motion. There is no parasitic motion when the mechanism rotates. The moving platform of the 3-UPU PM can always rotate continuously around any axis or any point in the symmetry plane. Li et al. [22] revealed the intrinsic relationship between the geometric parameters of the mechanism and the parasitic motion by establishing the kinematics model of the parasitic motion of the 3-PRS PM. Li et al. also pointed out that the [PP]S PM can eliminate the parasitic motion under certain structural conditions. Li et al. [23] obtained a series of 2R1T PMs without parasitic motion by using the displacement group synthesis method. Liu, CARRETERO et al. [24, 25] reduced the influence of the parasitic motion on\nthe complexity of the kinematic model by changing the mechanism structure.\nThe existing 2R1T PM without parasitic motion can accurately simulate road conditions. The branch chain arrangement conditions of the without parasitic motion mechanism are relatively harsh. The center of the kinematic pair that needs to be close to the moving platform is collinear. It leads to the weak carrying capacity of the mechanism and cannot be used in large-carrying occasions. The PM without parasitic motion proposed by Chen [21] needs to satisfy that the intersection points of the revolute pair axes close to the moving and fixed platform are all located in the middle plane. And such geometric conditions cannot process the prototype.\nReferences [19] to [21] propose configurations of some 2R1T mechanisms without parasitic motion. However, the parasitic motion analysis is only carried out for some mechanism. The obtained mechanism has a very weak bearing capacity and cannot be adapted to the actual working conditions.\nTherefore, in order to simulate the actual motion state of the engine and improve the accuracy of road spectrum reproduction. The development of high-precision engine motion simulation platform with large bearing capacity has become an urgent issue to be solved. Based on the working condition of the engine, this paper proposes a large-load 2R1T redundant PM without parasitic motion. Based on the geometric relationship between the branch constraint force and the rotation axis of the mechanism, the spatial distribution of the axis of the 2R1T mechanism without parasitic motion is obtained. A branch construction method of redundant mechanism without parasitic motion is proposed. According to the requirement of adding different DOF of redundant branch, the construction conditions of redundant branch are classified and studied. On the basis of the original non-redundant and mechanism without parasitic motion, a closed-loop unit is constructed. It does not damage the characteristics without parasitic motion of the mechanism, and can significantly improve the bearing capacity of the mechanism. It solves the problem that the\nbearing capacity of the existing mechanism without parasitic motion is extremely weak and cannot be practically applied. Based on the criterion, a redundant 2-RPS/2-UPS/PS PM without parasitic motion is proposed. The kinematics analysis and experimental verification of the mechanism are carried out. It is proved that the mechanism can meet the index requirements of high-precision engine road test. II. Design Index and Mechanism Design of Engine Motion\nSimulation Platform A. Technical index of engine motion simulation platform\nAccording to different types of vehicles, the working road conditions are mainly divided into highways, gravel roads, mountain roads, steep slopes and other environments. In addition, it also includes harsh environments such as sand, ditches, and hills. Vehicle operation under different road conditions is very different, mainly reflected in the ups and\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The vehicle is less undulating when running on the road. It fluctuates greatly and bumps when running on dirt roads and gravel roads. When running on mountain roads and steep slopes, there will be a large pitch and tilt angle.\nWhen the motion state of the vehicle changes, the position and posture of the engine also change in real time. This state of motion has a certain impact on the performance of the engine. During the operation of the vehicle, the engine is always in a complex working environment with different states such as pitch, roll, bump, etc. In order to simulate the real motion state of the vehicle engine, the working state of the engine is divided into three types: pitch, roll and vertical motion. The research goal of this paper is to design a parallel motion simulation platform for engine testing based on parallel mechanism. It can simulate the position and posture changes of the engine under different motion states such as pitch, roll and bump. The single motion state of the engine needs to be simulated, and the composite motion state also needs to be simulated.\nThe maximum climbing gradient of vehicles is an important index to evaluate the climbing performance of vehicles. At present, the maximum climbing gradient of most vehicles is about 20 degrees. The maximum climbing gradient of some SUV vehicles is about 30 degrees. In order to meet the testing requirements of most vehicle engines, it is determined that the angle range of the parallel motion simulation platform is not less than \u00b1 30 degrees. The specific technical index of the engine test motion simulation platform are shown in TABLE 1. Based on this technical index, this paper will conduct related research on the motion simulation platform."

            "text": "The relationship between the mechanism's rotation axis and the moving platform are discussed in this paper. The relationship between the constraint force of branch and the rotation axis are analyzed. The condition that 2R1T mechanism without parasitic motion is studied. Literature [26] points out that when the rotation axis of 2R1T PM is on the moving platform, the mechanism does not have parasitic motion. According to the analysis, there are three kinds of branches for 2R1T PM: (1) 3T2R branch, the branch has a constraint force; (2) 2T2R branch, the branch has one constraint force and one constraint force couple. (3) 1T2R branch, the branch has two constraint forces and one constraint couple. The kinematic pairs connected with the fixed platform can be revolute(R) pairs, universal(U) pairs,\nspherical(S) pairs and prismatic(P) pairs. When the kinematic pair connected to the fixed platform is a S pair or a U pair, if the restraint force of the branch is coplanar with all the R pairs of the branch, the restraint force must pass the center of the U pair and the S pair. If the restraint force of branch is on the fixed platform, the restraint force will not always intersect with the rotating axis of the mechanism. Therefore, the branch restraint force is located on the moving platform. The kinematic pair directly connected to the moving platform is the U pair or the S pair. The kinematic pair connected to the fixed platform can only be R pair or P pair.\nThe kinematic pair connected to the fixed platform is an R pair. The three branches intersect with the revolute pair\nconnected to the fixed platform. The restraint force of the three branches cannot intersect with the rotating axis on the moving platform at any time, which does not exist. As shown in FIGURE 1.\nThe revolute pairs connected with the three branches and the fixed platform are parallel to each other. There is only one restraint force and a restraint couple on the moving platform. The moving platform lacks a restraint force. It does not satisfy the DOF requirement. As shown in FIGURE 2. Therefore, the revolute pair connected to the fixed platform can only be one set of parallel, two sets of intersecting. As shown in FIGURE 3.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nVOLUME XX,2022 9\nAssume that the R pairs of branch 1 and branch 3 connected to the fixed platform are parallel to each other, and perpendicularly intersect with the axis of R pair of branch 2. At this time, the restraint force of the three branches is parallel to the R pair, acting on the moving platform. The rotation axis intersects with the three branch constraints at the same time. The rotating axis 1 is the connecting line of the center point of the kinematic pair when the three branches are collinear with the kinematic pair connected to the moving platform. The rotating axis 2 is parallel and coplanar with the constraint force directions of the branches 1 and 3. It intersects and coplanar with the restraining force directions of the branch 2. However, this does not satisfy the theory that the rotation axis of the 2R1T PM is all located on the moving platform pointed out in the reference [26]. This paper will correct this statement. Reference [26] only proves that one of the rotation axes of the moving platform coincides with the y-axis of the moving platform. The location of the other axis is not proven. It is just inferred that the other rotating axis is also located on the moving platform. Through the above analysis, it is proved that this statement is wrong.\nThe spatial distribution conditions of the axis of 2R1T\nPM without parasitic motion are as follows:\n(1) When the rotating axis 1 of the mechanism is collinear with the center of the kinematic pair connected by three branch chains and the moving platform, the connecting line R1 of the center point of the kinematic pair.\n(2) The rotation axis 2 of the mechanism is the rotation axis R2 which passes through the center point of the moving platform and is parallel to the X axis of the fixed platform."

The bearing capacity on both sides of the R1 axis is weak and cannot be used in high-load applications. Therefore, the construction method of redundant mechanism\nwithout parasitic motion is proposed in this paper. On the basis of the original mechanism without parasitic motion, a closed-loop unit is constructed. It does not damage the characteristics without parasitic motion of the mechanism, but also improves the bearing capacity of the mechanism.

The restraint forces can only be provided by this branch, and the restraint couples cannot be provided. Due to this branch provides a restraint couple, the restraint couple cannot always be perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the moving platform. To sum up, there are 14 types of the branch 1 and the branch 3, 4 types of the branch 2, and 7 types of redundant branches. Combining the above branches, 5488 redundant PMs without parasitic motion are obtained.\nThe 3-RPS PM is a typical 2R1T mechanism, which has rotational DOF around the x-axis and y-axis and translational DOF along the z-axis. When the kinematics of this mechanism is analyzed, it is easy to find that the mechanism has parasitic motion. When the moving platform rotates around the x-axis and the y-axis, the moving platform often has parasitic motions that translate along the x-axis and the y-axis. The existence of parasitic motion is not conducive to the control and trajectory planning of the motion simulation platform.\nBased on the branch construction criterion of the redundant PM without parasitic motion, the three S pairs of the mechanism are arranged collinearly. The revolute pairs of the branch 1 and the branch 3 are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the connecting line of the S pair. The revolute pair of the branch 2 is parallel to the connecting line of the S pair to obtain a 3-RPS PM without parasitic motion.\nThe 3-RPS mechanism without parasitic motion is shown in FIGURE 7. A1\u3001A2\u3001A3 are R pairs, L1\u3001L2\u3001L3 are P pairs, B1 \u3001 B2 \u3001 B3 are S pairs, the fixed and moving\nplatforms are all isosceles right triangle. The moving platform and the fixed platform are parallel to each other in initial position. B1\u3001B2 and B3 are arranged in line. A1 and A3 are parallel and perpendicular to the connecting line of A1A3, and A2 is parallel to the connecting line of A1A3.\nAs shown in FIGURE 8, the branch coordinate system and the mechanism coordinate system are established. The branch coordinate system Ai-xyz is established with Ai as the origin. The fixed coordinate system O1-XYZ is established with the midpoint O1 of A1A3 as the origin, and the moving coordinate system is established with B3 as the origin O3-xyz.\nThe kinematic screw system of each branch of the\nmechanism is\n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n( )\n1\n2 2 2\n3 3\n4 4 4\n5 5\n0 1 0; 0 0 0\n0 0 0; 0\n1 0 0; 0 0\n0 1 0; 0\n0 0 1; 0 0\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nd f\ne\nd f\ne\n =  =  =  = \u2212  = \u2212 $ $ $ $ $\n(1)\nBy determining the reciprocal screw of the kinematic screw system of the branch, the constraint screw of the branch can be obtained as\n( )0 1 0; 0ri d f= \u2212$ (2) In this paper, the prismatic pair is used as the actuation pair, that is, $i2 is the input kinematic screw.

It is still a 2R1T PM at this moment.\nAs shown in FIGURE 10, the two RPS branches, two UPS branches and one PS branch are connected to the square fixed platform and the mobile platform, forming a 2-RPS/2UPS/PS PM. In the initial position, the R pairs of the two RPS branches are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the diagonal A1A3 of the fixed platform.

            "text": "In order to calculate the working space of the 2-RPS/2UPS/PS PM, it is necessary to limit the structural parameters of the mechanism. After the relevant parameters of the fixed platform and the moving platform of the 2-RPS/2-UPS/PS parallel motion simulation platform are determined. The main factors affecting the working space of the PM are the limitation of the length of the driving link of the mechanism. The limitation of the movement range of each kinematic pair, and the limitation of interference between each link.\nThe parameter values of the 2-RPS/2-UPS/PS PM are set as follows: the radius of the moving platform is 500mm. The radius of the fixed platform is 750mm. The length of the drive branch is limited to 1300-2100mm. And the movement range of the S pair and the U pair is \u00b145\u00b0. According to the above parameters, the working space of the parallel motion simulation platform calculated is shown in FIGURE 13.\nThe translation range of the parallel motion simulation platform in the Z direction is \u00b1400mm, and the rotation range around the x-axis and the y-axis is 30\u00b0. FIGURE 13a) is the three-dimensional view of the parallel motion simulation\nplatform workspace. The shape of the upper and lower parts is similar to a quadrangular pyramid. The shape of the middle part is similar to a cylinder. FIGURE 13b) is a schematic diagram of the projection of the workspace of the PM in the xy plane. It can be seen that the maximum rotation angle of the PM around the x-axis and y-axis directions can reach 30 degrees. It meet the design requirements of parallel motion simulation platform. FIGURE 13c) and FIGURE 13d) are the projection schematic diagrams of the workspace of the PM in the xz plane and yz, respectively. When the position of the center of the moving platform is between 1500-1800mm, the rotation angles of the PM around the xaxis and y-axis directions are both greater than 30 degrees. And when the center of the moving platform is raised or lowered, the rotation angle of the PM gradually becomes smaller. IV. Finite Element Simulation of Parallel Motion\nSimulation Platform Prototype\nIn order to verify the rationality of the structure of each component in the parallel motion simulation platform, and to ensure that the strength of each part of the prototype meets the requirements for use. Therefore, it is necessary to perform finite element analysis on the model of the PM before the prototype is processed. The simplified structure of the parallel motion simulation platform is shown in FIGURE 14.\nIn this paper, the finite element analysis of the parallel motion simulation platform is carried out. The equivalent stress distribution of the 2-RPS/2-UPS/PS PM and 3- RPS/UPS PM with large bearing capacity under the condition of applying a load of 500kg is obtained. The 3- RPS/UPS PM does not need to meet strict geometric conditions, but there is parasitic motion, and the bearing capacity is very strong. As shown in FIGURE 15 and FIGURE 16.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nVOLUME XX,2022 9\nBoth configurations have the same structural parameters, cross-sectional area and boundary conditions. When a 500kg load is added to the moving platform of the model, that is, a force of 5000N is applied to the moving platform of the model. The maximum value of the equivalent stress of the 2- RPS/2-UPS/PS is 7.4MPa. The maximum value of the equivalent stress of the 3-RPS/UPS PM is 8.9MPa. The maximum stress of the 2-RPS/2-UPS/PS PM is much smaller than the maximum stress of the 3-RPS/UPS PM. Therefore, the redundant 2R1T PM without parasitic motion proposed in this paper has a large bearing capacity. At this time, the maximum value of the equivalent stress of the model is less than the yield limit of the material. It meets the requirements of the material. The finite element analysis results show that the equivalent stress distribution of the model meets the index requirements of the prototype design."
