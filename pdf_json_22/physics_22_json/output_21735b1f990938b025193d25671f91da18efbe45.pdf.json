Using highresolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of the archetypical valence fluctuating compound EuNi2P2 that hosts multiple f electrons. At low temperatures, we reveal the hybridization between Eu 4f and Ni 3d states, which contributes to the electron mass enhancement, consistent with the periodic Anderson model. With increasing temperature, interestingly, we observe opposite temperature evolution of electron spectral function above and below the Kondo coherence temperature near 110 K, which is in contrast to the monotonic valence change and beyond the expectation of the periodic Anderson model. We argue that both f-d hybridization and correlation are imperative in the electronic properties of EuNi2P2. Our results shed light on the understanding of novel properties, such as heavy fermion behaviors and valence fluctuation, of rare-earth transition-metal intermetallic compounds with multiple f electrons.\nRare-earth transition-metal intermetallic compounds (RTICs) provide a fertile playground\nto explore various fascinating emergent properties with strong electronic correlation [1-5]. One prominent example is the valence fluctuation effect, where f-electron states are partially occupied, inducing the non-integral or intermediate valency of rare-earth elements [6,7]. Historically, two paradigmatic theoretical frameworks have been established to understand this mysterious effect. The first one interprets the valence fluctuation as a quantum mechanical mixing of two integral valence states induced by the hybridization between localized 4f and itinerant conduction electrons, as described by the periodic Anderson model (PAM), which is an effective model in the study of heavy fermion systems [8,9]. The other theory, by contrast, considers the valence fluctuation as arising from thermal fluctuation between two different integral valences induced by Coulomb interaction between 4f and conduction electrons (FK interaction), as proposed in the Falicov-Kimball model (FKM) [10,11].\nThe situation is, however, much more complicated in realistic materials due to the\nentanglement of the hybridization and Coulomb interaction between f and conduction electrons. While Ce- and Yb-based valence fluctuating systems are generally well described by the PAM [12-14], the FK interaction is proposed to be important for understanding the valence transition in YbInCu4 and \u03b3-\u03b1 transition of Ce metal [15,16]. Moreover, the valence fluctuation derived from FK interaction serves as a pairing mechanism for the enhanced superconductivity in heavy fermion system CeCu2Si2 [17] and induces the non-Fermi liquid behavior near the quantum critical point of the Doniach phase diagram [17,18], which strongly challenges the conventional spin fluctuation mechanism. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the hybridization and correlation between f and conduction electrons to understand novel properties of RITCs, such as heavy fermion behavior and valence fluctuation effect. Particularly, it is highly desirable to experimentally investigate RTICs with multiple f electrons that are rarely explored.\nIn this letter, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nand ab-initio calculation, we comprehensively study the electronic structure of a prototypical valence fluctuating material EuNi2P2 with multiple f electrons [19]. At low temperatures, we observe the hybridization between Eu 4f- and Ni 3d-states, as manifested by the gap opening near f-d band crossings and a kink near the Fermi level (EF), reminiscent of Ce-based heavy fermion systems and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations of PAM [20,21]. The f-d hybridization contributes to electron mass enhancement at low temperatures, which explains the moderate heavy-fermion behavior of EuNi2P2. In contrast to the monotonic valence change with temperature, both the spectral functions of Eu 4f- and Ni 3d-electrons show opposite temperature evolution below and above the Kondo coherence temperature near 110 K, where the resistivity curve shows a local maximum [22]. We argue that the FK interaction should be considered in understanding the valence fluctuation effect in Eu-based compounds and, possibly, in other f-electron systems.\nHigh-quality single crystals of EuNi2P2 were synthesized by a Sn-flux method [22]. High-\nresolution ARPES measurements were performed at beamline 4.5.1 of Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light Source (SSRL), beamline SIS of Swiss Light Source (SLS), and beamline BL03U of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). Data were collected with Scienta R4000 (DA30) electron analyzers at SSRL and SLS (SSRF). The overall energy and angular resolutions were set to 15 meV and 0.2\u00b0, respectively. The samples were cleaved in situ and measured under ultra-high vacuum less than 1.0 \u00d7 10\u221210 mbar. First-principles band structure calculations were performed using QUANTUM ESPRESSO code package [23] with a plane wave basis. The exchange-correlation energy was considered under Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof\n(PBE) type generalized gradient approximation (GGA) [24]. The f electrons of Eu atoms were treated as core states. The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis was set to 480 and 960 eV for calculation without and with spin-orbit coupling, respectively. A \u0393-centered Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh of 11 \u00d711 \u00d7 5 was adopted for a self-consistent charge density.\nEuNi2P2 crystallizes in a body-centered tetragonal ThCr2Si2- (I-) type structure with two\nNi-P layers separated by a Eu layer in each unit cell [Fig. 1(a)]. The electrical resistivity shows a local maximum near 110 K [Fig. 1(b)], consistent with previous reports [22] and similar to Ce-based heavy fermion materials [2,25,26]. While this local maximum is usually attributed to the Kondo coherence temperature in heavy fermion systems, it can also be derived from the renormalization of density of states near EF in FKM [27]. The temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility in Fig. 1(b) exhibits a Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperatures and saturates below 50 K, which is commonly observed in valence fluctuating materials and can be explained either by the phenomenological inter-configuration fluctuation (ICF) model [19] or the coherence of Kondo resonance [22]. Fig. 1(c) shows the X-ray photoemission spectrum with the characteristic Eu, Ni and P core-level peaks. We observe both Eu2+ and Eu3+ 3d peaks, confirming the valence fluctuating nature of EuNi2P2 [28].\nFigure 2 presents the electronic structure of EuNi2P2. On the Fermi surface (FS), we\nobserve a large four-point-star like hole pocket around the \u0393\u0305 point, which crosses the Brillouin zone (BZ) edge [marked as , the black dashed curve in Fig. 2(a)]. In addition, there exists another hole pocket  around the \u0393\u0305 point in the second BZ, suggesting a kz dependence of the Fermi surface. Our ab-initio calculation in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) captures the general FS structure,\nincluding the large and small hole pockets around \u0393\u0305 [Fig. 2(c)]. It is worth noting that the FS of EuNi2P2 is mainly constructed by Ni 3d orbitals (Supplemental Material, Fig. S2 [29]). Figures 2(d)-(g) show the band structure along high-symmetry directions. Consistent with the FS structure, we observe an electron-like band  (from the large hole pocket in the second BZ) and a hole-like band  around \u0393\u0305, which are better visualized in the second BZ [Figs. 2(d)-(f)]. The measured band structure is nicely reproduced by ab-initio calculation of Ni 3d bands after renormalized by a factor of about 1.25 [the dashed lines in Figs. 2(d)-(g)], suggesting a weak electronic correlation effect of Ni 3d electrons. In addition to the  and  bands that cross EF, Ni 3d orbitals also form dispersive band  at high binding energies below 1 eV.\nProminently, we observe multiple flat bands between -0.7 eV and EF, which intersect with\nthe dispersive conduction bands [Figs. 2(d)-(g)]. These multiplets are identified as Eu 4f6 final states carrying different total angular momenta [30,31]. Previous ARPES measurements have shown the hybridization between Eu 4f flat bands and Ni 3d valence band that is far below EF [the  band in Fig. 2(g)] at specific momentum region [31]. Figure 3 investigates the hybridization between Eu 4f multiplets and the conduction bands that cross EF, i.e., the  and  bands. In Fig. 3(a), we notice that the flat band F6 near -0.75 eV shows a clear curvature near the \u0393\u0305 point as indicated by the green arrow, suggesting the hybridization with the  band. The hybridization between the flat f bands and  band is better visualized along ?\u0305??\u0305?, which opens multiple gaps, as indicated by the blue arrows in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c). Interestingly, we observe a kink-like structure in the  band along ?\u0305??\u0305? near -40 meV, as shown by the red arrow in the zoom-in plot of ARPES image and momentum distribution curves (MDCs) in Figs. 3(d) and 3(e). By fitting the MDCs to a Lorentzian, the kink is clearly observed in the extracted  band\ndispersion [Fig. 3(f)]. Since the F0 band resides at about -0.1 eV, we emphasize that the kink is not induced by the hybridization between the  band and the F0 band. Instead, it is reminiscent of the kink induced by Kondo resonance in Ce-based heavy fermion systems [20,21,32,33] and can be well understood by the PAM, which considers the interaction between the Kondo resonance and the conduction band. With the renormalized f level (the Kondo resonance) energy \ud835\udf000 and renormalized hybridization energy \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc58 as fitting parameters, the fit to PAM nicely reproduces the observed kink, giving \ud835\udf000=24 meV and \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc58=56 \u00b1 5 meV [orange curve in Fig. 3(f), Supplemental Material, Fig. S3 [29]], similar to the value of Vk in CeCoGe1.2Si0.8[32]. The observed f-d hybridization, according to the PAM, can induce the heaviness of electrons. Indeed, the Fermi velocity of the  band is reduced by a factor of about 2.2, suggesting an enhancement of effective electron mass [22,34,35]. Although this value is much smaller than that obtained from specific heat measurement, it is consistent with the fact that ARPES usually reports a much smaller mass enhancement than that in transport measurements [32,36].\nTo further investigate the interplay between localized 4f electrons and itinerant 3d electrons, we conduct temperature-dependent ARPES measurements up to 205 K in Figure 4. Fig. 4(a) presents the temperature evolution of MDCs at EF along ?\u0305??\u0305? to track the shift of the  band, and Fig. 4(b) presents the temperature evolution of the energy distribution curves (EDCs) integrated over the momentum window of [0.4, 0.7] \u00c5-1 along \u0393\u0305?\u0305? , where only flat-bands contribute to the photoemission spectra (Supplemental Materials, Figs. S4-S6 [29]). Unexpectedly, we extract a non-monotonic shift of both the  band and the flat bands above and below 110 K, as summarized in Fig. 4(c). We also observe a non-monotonic change of the spectral weight of the flat bands with temperature, as shown in Figs. 4(d) and 4(e). Both the\nband shift and the change of flat-band spectral weight are reminiscent of the resistivity of EuNi2P2, suggesting a correlation between the evolution of the electronic structure and transport properties.\nThe spectral evolution below 110 K is consistent with the valence change from Eu2+ to\nEu3+ at low temperatures. However, the spectral response above 110 K, i.e., the reversed shift of both f and conduction bands, is in drastic contrast to the monotonic valence change with the temperature and cannot be understood within the classical PAM. Instead, previous optical spectra suggest that the correlation between the localized f and itinerant conduction electrons (FK interaction), as in the FKM, should be considered [34]. Similar to the correlation effect in the Hubbard model, the FK interaction also tends to split the non-interacting spectral function of electrons into lower and upper sub-bands, only this Hubbard-like splitting occurs for both f and conduction electrons [27,37,38]. Moreover, the FK interaction can be enhanced by increased f electron concentration at high temperatures, similar to the situation in YbInCu4 and EuNi2Si1-xGex [39], which induces the reversed shift of both f and conduction bands and spectral weight transfer from lower to higher sub-bands above 110 K [27,39,40]. The relevance of the FK interaction is further supported by the observation of an energy gap at the Fermi momentum of the  band above 110 K as shown in Figs. 4(f) and 4(g) [27,39].\nTherefore, our results suggest that on the one hand, spin and charge fluctuation play an\nimportant role in the low-temperature properties of EuNi2P2 according to the PAM, as suggested by the direct observation of the f-d hybridization and the band renormalization by Kondo resonance [41]. On the other hand, the FK interaction may further enhance the spin and charge\nfluctuations [42-44]. The synergetic effect of hybridization and correlation between the f and conduction electrons makes EuNi2P2 a unique system among Eu-based valence fluctuating materials [7], which exhibits not only a heavy fermion state originated from Kondo effect [22,45], but also a genuine valence fluctuation behavior with a Eu-valence of 2.5 at the ground state [19].\nIn conclusion, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of EuNi2P2 and its\ntemperature evolution using ARPES. We suggest that both the hybridization and correlation effects between the f and conduction electrons should be considered to fully understand the electronic properties of EuNi2P2. Our results provide important insights into the microscopic interaction between the localized f and itinerant conduction electrons in a multi-f-electron system other than the widely investigated Ce- and Yb-based compounds, which will shed light on the understanding of the intriguing properties of RITCs such as heavy fermion and valence fluctuation effects."
