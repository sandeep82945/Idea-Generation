Protecting sensitive data is an essential part of security in cloud computing. However, only specific privileged individuals have access to view or interact with this data; therefore, it is unscalable to depend on these individuals also to maintain the software. A solution to this is to allow non-privileged individuals access to maintain these systems but mask sensitive information from egressing. To this end, we have created a machine-learning model to predict and redact fields with sensitive data. This work concentrates on Azure PowerShell, showing how it applies to other command-line interfaces and APIs. Using the F5-score as a weighted metric, we demonstrate different transformation techniques to map this problem from an unknown field to the well-researched area of natural language processing. 1. conclusion and future work This work demonstrates how to convert PowerShell commands to the well-researched NLP domain. From there, we compare popular techniques and find that BOW-PF performs best at creating features for different types of models. This work exploited the sentence-like structure of commands, variable names, and variable types. Using F5-Score as a metric for comparison allows us to summarize system goals into one value for optimizing across thresholds and in subsequent retraining. Slight adaptions to this work yield a system that works
across different CLIs.
