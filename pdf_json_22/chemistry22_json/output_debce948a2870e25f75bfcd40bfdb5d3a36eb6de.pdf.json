    "abstractText": "The growth of the textile industry results in a massive accumulation of dyes on water. This enormous rise in pigments is the primary source of water pollution, affecting the aquatic lives and our ecosystem balance. This study aims to notify the fabrication of neodymium incorporated copper oxide (Nd2O3 doped CuO) nanoparticles by combustion method for effective degradation of dye, methylene blue (MB). X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission Scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Zeta potential have been applied for characterization. Photocatalyst validity has been evaluated for methylene blue degradation (MB). Test conditions such as time of contact, H2O2, pH, and photoFenton have been modified to identify optimal degradation conditions. Noticeably, 7.5% Nd2O3 doped CuO nanoparticle demonstrated the highest photocatalytic efficiency, up to 90.8% in 80 min, with a 0.0227 min\u22121 degradation rate. However, the photocatalytic efficiency at pH 10 becomes 99% with a rate constant of 0.082 min\u22121. Cyclic experiments showed the Nd2O3 doped CuO nanoparticle\u2019s stability over repeated use. Scavenge hydroxyl radical species responsible for degradation using 7.5% Nd2O3 doped CuO nanoparticles have been investigated under visible irradiation.",

So, it is essential to remediate the dyestuffs wastewater to save water and the environment [4].\nScheme 1. Chemical structure of MB dye.\nConsequently, water pollution must be eliminated [5]. Physical techniques such as adsorption and chemical techniques are employed to remove the textile dyes [6]. The advanced oxidation process includes heterogeneous photocatalysis, low-cost and sustainable technology for water purification that takes place on photocatalyst particles in the presence of photons, causing them to be mineralized [7].\nReusable photocatalysts are used to degrade organic contaminants in photocatalysis. As particle size is reduced, the photocatalyst\u2019s surface area increases. As a result, the number of activating sites has increased, resulting in a higher reactivity. After the absorption of light, the electron has been excited, generating a hole, O2.\u2212 and OH. has been formed due to the reaction between e\u2212 with O2 and h+ with OH\u2212 or H2O [8]. Many researchers have examined the degradation of various reactive dyes with visible light-assisted Fenton (H2O2/Fe2+ or Fe3+) and photo-Fenton (UV-Vis/H2O2/Fe2+ or Fe3+) reactions [4]. Both the mechanism and kinetics of the response have been widely explored [9]. Fenton\u2019s reagent, the mixture of H2O2 and ferrous iron, produces hydroxyl radicals with the ferrous (Fe2+) ions, which initiate and catalyze H2O2 decomposition.\nMetal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) such as ZnO, CoO, TiO2, SnO2, and CuO represent one strategy to lower aqueous organic dyes. In particular, CuO NPs have significant potential because of their low cost, low toxicity, easy availability, optical, catalytic, and antimicrobial characteristics. In addition, copper oxide nanoparticles are noteworthy because of their surface area and increased adsorbed oxygen capacity, leading its bandgap to be ranged from 1.35 to 3.5 eV [10,11]. The strong ability of CuO-NPs for molecular oxygen absorption has a significant impact on the electron-hole pair rearrangement and the removal of the photogenerated electron [12]. Nd2O3 is rare earth oxide that improves the efficiency of CuO photocatalysis for MB photodegradation in the presence of light with a lower cost [13]. The preparation and characterization of Nd2O3 NPs have drawn much attention to be studied because of their nano-size structure and surface.\nIn this work, we synthesized CuO and Nd2O3 doped CuO photocatalysts with different concentrations of neodymium oxide (Nd2O3) and characterized by various experimental techniques such as XRD, FESEM, EDX, and DLS.

Indexes the peaks of the studied samples, and no peaks of impurities are found in the XRD pattern. It could be observed that the Nd2O3 doped CuO NPs had the same XRD design as the CuO, indicating the crystalline structure of the photocatalyst. The excellent dispersion of Nd2O3 via CuO, which acts as the host crystal, has also been confirmed. A small secondary phase appeared due to incorporating Nd2O3 with different percentages (1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10%) into the CuO matrix. Two crystalline peaks appeared at 2-theta: 23\u25e6, and 32\u25e6 with hkl = [110] and [011]. They correspond to the peaks of Nd2O3 as hexagonal phase (JCPDS card No. 01-074-2139). These two peaks strongly appeared at 10% Nd2O3 doped CuO nanoparticles [13,17].

The lattice strain (\u03b5) was determined using the following method [18]:\n\u03b5 = \u03b2 cos \u03b8\n4 , (2)\nDislocation density (\u03b4) has been achieved by [18,19]:\n\u03b4 = 1\nD2 (3)\nMoreover, where the diffraction peak angle is \u03b8. The calculated mean values of the grain size (D) are tabulated in Table 2. The first phase\u2019s average crystallite domain size ranges from 22.0 to 30.1 nm, while the second phase ranges from 27.1 to 36.7 nm.\nThe value of (D) for CuO is found in the range of 20\u201330 nm. It was found that (D) of Nd2O3 sample with Scherrer formula is about 35 nm. The \u03b5 and \u03b4 were calculated and tabulated in Table 2. It was found that Nd2O3 and CuO atoms bond with O\u2212 atoms by\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1060 7 of 20\nincreasing Nd2O3 content. Lattice strain (\u03b5) arises from the slight variation in the atomic radii of Nd2+- and Cu2+- beside Nd2O3 content, where Cu2+ is replaced with Nd2+ in the host lattice. The decrease in lattice strain (1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123) at 7.5% Nd2O3 doped CuO nanoparticle (Table 2) because of atomic radii and dopant concentration reduces local distortion of the crystal lattice. The crystallite size (30.1 nm) of the 7.5% of Nd-CuO sample was increased because of a decrease in \u03b4 (1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 nm2) and intrinsic micro-strain [20].\n3.2. FESEM Analysis of Nd2O3 Doped CuO Nanostructured\nThe efficiency and activity of photocatalysts depend on the morphological parameters [21]. Therefore, the morphology characterization of the CuO nanoparticles was investigated by FESEM, as shown in Figure 3A. The nanoparticles have a uniform size, spherical shape, and appropriate separation [22,23]. Figure 3B\u2013F exhibit the FESEM images of Nd2O3 doped CuO NPs at various concentration of Nd2O3. It is evident that the particles had quasi-spherical shapes and aggregated homogeneously. Empty spaces between the particles are pores arising from the inter-aggregation of particles [15]. From the FESEM result, the average crystalline size of the prepared nanocomposite materials was found in the range of 17\u201339 nm. As shown in the Table 3, 7.5%Nd2O3 doped CuO has the smallest value of particle size (17 nm), which means that increasing surface area of catalyst thereby, the improvement of photodegradation efficiency of catalyst [15].

Table 5 indicates the comparison of photocatalytic degradation of MB and other dyes in the presence of Nd-doped metal oxide with different previous work samples. M. Arunpandian et al. [30] found that 0.3 wt% of Nd2O3-doped ZnO was the highest active, showing high photocatalytic activity for the degradation of MB dye. Arun Pandian M. et al. [16] It was shown that MB degradation was by Ag/Nd2O3-ZnO Nanocomposite within 30 min with a 98.12 percent efficiency under visible light. Dhanya et al. [31] Including Nd3+ in the SnO2 lattice decreases bandgap and inhibits the electron-hole recombination. Thus, visible light can excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band. Samuel et al. [32] Nd\u2013ZnO showed good photocatalytic activity. In comparison to ZnO, nanocomposite [Nd\u2013ZnO\u2013GO (0.3% of Nd)] demonstrated higher photocatalytic efficiency and could be regarded for promise as a photocatalyst in organic wastewater treatment. Samuel Osei-Bonsu Oppong et al. [33] The photodegradation efficiency of indigo carmine solutions exposed to simulated solar light for 3 h with Nd\u2013TiO2\u2013GO (0.6 percent Nd) nanocomposites was found to be 92 percent. Umair Alam et al. [34] showed that the Nd-doped ZnO is the best activity with 98% degradation efficiency compared used other rare earth metals. Sonali et al. [35] The optimum photocatalytic activity for MB degradation was ob-served for 3.0 mol. Percent Ce-CuO, which led to 98 percent degradation in 180 min. Xia Shao et al. [36] When the ratio of Nd to TiO2 is 3\u20134 wt%, the highest activity is reached, and MB is degraded by UV- light in 160 min. Reda M. Mohamed et al. [37] For 2 h, the photocatalytic efficiency of mesoporous 3 percent Nd2O3/ZnO for TC degradation reached 100%. Moondeep et al. [26] under diverse energy sources, such as UV-visible irradiation and UV radiations, the degradation efficiency of CuO NPs on cationic (VB) and anionic (DR) dyes were measured.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 1060 15 of 20\nIn practical applications, the photostability of a photocatalyst is an essential feature. The synthesized Nd2O3 doped CuO photocatalyst was exposed to five photocatalytic trial runs to determine its photostability by adding the reused photocatalyst to new MB solutions under the same experimental conditions. The photocatalyst was reused after centrifugation without regeneration. Figure 10 depicts the recycling of 7.5% Nd2O3 doped CuO nanostructured. It was found that, in five successive experimental runs, photocatalyst activity reached 88% of MB degradation, which promotes the prepared samples for its photocatalytic performance in environmental treatment.

Influence of Radicals\u2019 Scavengers on Photocatalytic Activity The photocatalytic reaction occurs in 3 stages: absorption of light, generation and separation of electron-hole, and oxidation-reduction response on the photocatalyst\u2019s surface. e\u2212 and h+ are extremely recombined so, the trapping and transfer of surface charges are limited. Therefore, it is vital to eliminate the recombination of surface charge and promote charge transfer to the surface-active sites to boost the carriers\u2019 dynamics and photocatalytic activity. There have thus been significant attempts to increase the effectiveness of photocatalysts [21]. The scavenging of active characters responsible for photodegradation in the presence of 7.5% Nd2O3 doped CuO nanoparticle is examined as demonstrated in Figure 11a. The scavengers applied such as NaCl for h+, NaNO3 for e\u2212, IPA for OH. and Ascorbic acid for O .. From the data shown in Figure 11b, the use of NaCl, NaNO3, IPA, and Ascorbic acid as scavengers is responsible for eliminating MB contaminants of around 56, 36.7, 19.4, and 98 percent. The most efficient agent in eliminating pollutants may be regarded as hydroxy radicals. Sahar Zinatloo et al. [38] reported that in the presence of Nd2O3-SiO2, hydroxyl radicals were the most efficient agent for the degradation of methyl violet.\nThe photocatalytic reaction occurs in 3 stages: absorption of light, generation and separation of electron-hole, and oxidation-reduction response on the photocatalyst\u2019s surface. e\u2212 a d h+ are extremely recombined so, the trapping and transfer f surface charges are limited.
