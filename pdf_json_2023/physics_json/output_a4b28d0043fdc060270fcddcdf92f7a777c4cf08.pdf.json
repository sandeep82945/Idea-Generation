    "abstractText": "Replication of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) requires the presence of a metaldependent endonuclease at the C-terminus of pUL89, in order to properly pack and cleave the viral genome. Therefore, pUL89 is an attractive target to design anti-CMV intervention. Herein, we used integrated structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening approaches in combination with MD simulation for the identification of potential metal binding small molecule antagonist of pUL89. In this regard, the essential chemical features needed for the inhibition of pUL89 endonuclease domain were defined and used as a 3D query to search chemical compounds from ZINC and ChEMBL database. Thereafter, the molecular docking and ligand-based shape screening were used to narrow down the compounds based on previously identified pUL89 antagonists. The selected virtual hits were further subjected to MD simulation to determine the intrinsic and ligand-induced flexibility of pUL89. The predicted binding modes showed that the compounds reside well in the binding site of endonuclease domain by chelating with the metal ions and crucial residues. Taken in concert, the in silico investigation led to the identification of potential pUL89 antagonists. This study provided promising starting point for further in vitro and in vivo studies.",

            "text": "At an alarmingly high rate of prevalence all over the world, human Cytomegalovirus or HCMV is one of the most widespread herpesviruses [1]. The prevalence of HCMV infection in the human population varies widely, with seroprevalence rates ranging from 30% to 90% in developed countries. The prevalence of HCMV infection increases with age, reflecting the greater likelihood of exposure over time [2]. Human cytomegalovirus is typically benign in healthy individuals but can cause serious complications in fetuses, neonates, and immunocompromised patients. In these populations, HCMV infection can lead to a range of damaging effects, including birth defects, developmental delays, and lifethreatening conditions such as encephalitis, pneumonia, and hepatitis [3\u20135]. So far infected individuals are treated palliatively with approved HCMV drugs such as an antisense 21 mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, Fomivirsen, DNA polymerase inhibitors including;\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3938. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28093938 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3938 2 of 13\nGanciclovir, Valganciclovir, Cidofovir, and Foscarnet and a DNA terminase inhibitor, Letermovir to alleviate infection [6\u201311]. All these antiviral drugs are associated with a number of side effects [12,13]. Moreover, many viral strains have emerged with resistance to these antiviral drugs [14]. There is an urgent need for the development of novel antiviral therapies with good pharmacological profile and reduced side-effects. Over the past two decades, efforts have been made to design new chemical compounds as inhibitors of CMV with potent antiviral activity [15\u201323]. Despite of such extensive research, no pUL89 therapeutic reached the clinical development and optimization. HCMV terminase is a protein composed of two subunits, a small and a large subunit. The small subunit binds the DNA, while the large subunit has both endonuclease and ATPase activities. The endonuclease activity cleaves the DNA, and the ATPase activity mediates the translocation of the DNA into the preformed capsid. This process helps in the formation of unit-length genomes during packaging, which is crucial for the maturation of the HCMV virus. Therefore, among many therapeutic targets, CMV terminase machinery, is an attractive therapeutic target to developed anti-CMV therapies [24]. It has been also suggested that blocking or targeting CMV terminase complex with terminase inhibitors may have less undesired effects than targeting the other CMV proteins. HCMV terminase complex consist of three subunits namely, UL56, UL89, and UL51 [25]. UL56, is thought to play multiple roles in the packaging process: (i) mediating specific binding to pac motifs on the concatamers, (ii) providing energy for DNA translocation to the procapsids, and (iii) associating with the capsid to enable DNA entry. On the other hand, pUL89, primarily plays a role in cleaving the concatemeric DNA into unit-length genomes. The UL89 protein (pUL89) consists of N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain consists of 1-417 amino acids with adenosinetriphosphatase activity while C-terminal consists of 418-674 amino acids with nuclease activity [26]. Developing specific inhibitors for viral UL89-N may be difficult due to the highly conserved ATP binding motif in a wide variety of proteins. Instead, developing HCMV inhibitors that can specifically target the nuclease activity of UL89-C is a more effective approach. In this regard researchers in academia have discovered several potential inhibitors of pUL89 with low micromolar biological activity. In 2017, Wang and coworkers discovered hydroxypyridonecarboxylic acid analogs as inhibitors of pUL89 endonuclease activity using ELISA format as a screening assay [27]. The year later, the same group performed the structure-activity relationship of the hydroxypyridonecarboxylic acid scaffold to under-stand the impact of the carboxylic acid functionality and the N1 site on the activity of pUL89 [28]. Their efforts led to the identification of several analogues that effectively inhibit both pUL89-C and HCMV with low micromolar potency and no observed cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 200 \u00b5m. Several similar studies were also conducted that led to the identification of potential pUL89 inhibitors with different chemical scaffold [22,29]. In this study, we identified potential virtual hits against pUL89 C-terminal domain of HCMV by using computational techniques. To utilized the available chemical and biological information of pUL89 inhibition we integrated the computational structure and ligand-based drug design approaches. In the result of multistep screening we identified potential chemical compounds having diverse scaffold from the known antagonists of pUL89. The findings of our study could be further used for in vitro experimental studies to validate the potencies of the identified virtual hits against CMV."

            "text": "MD simulation is a state-of-the-art simulation method for studying the physical motion of target protein in the presence of ligands along with the various interactions within a system [33\u201335]. Herein, three replicas of 100 ns simulations were carried out for Apo pUL89 both in its free form and in complex with SK-1, SK-2, and SK-7, in order to evaluate the protein\u2019s motions and flexibility, which contribute to the interaction dynamics of protein-ligand complexes. The results of the first replica are presented here, while the graphs for the second and third replicas are provided in Figures S2\u2013S5. The protein-ligand complexes intrinsic and ligand-induced flexibility was evaluated by plotting root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) and Radius of Gyration (Rg). The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) measures the difference between the positions of atoms in the target protein during a simulation and the positions in the initial reference structure. A low RMSD value indicates that the system is stable and has reached convergence, while larger fluctuations may indicate that the system is not yet fully equilibrated. The stability of simulated systems was evaluated by RMSD of backbone carbon atoms (Figure 2). The RMSD plot of Apo and protein-ligand complexes demonstrated the significant stability for all the simulated systems. All the systems were fluctuated between 0.15 nm to 0.45 nm with variable fluctuation. Upon closer examine it was observed that SK-1 and SK-2 significantly stabilized the endonuclease domain of pUL89 upon binding in comparison of SK-7. Visual analysis of the trajectories revealed that, during the simulations, the ligands remained within the protein pocket and experienced less fluctuation compared to their initial placement as depicted in Figure 3. SK-1 showed the most stable RMSD with no major fluctuations. Whereas, SK-2 was relatively unstable, however the deviations were in the acceptable range (0\u20130.2 nm). Similarly, SK-7 also showed the relatively stable RMSD throughout the course of the simulation. This observation delineated that the selected compounds were reside well in the binding site of pUL89 throughout the 100 ns of simulation. Root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) analysis is a method used to calculate the time-dependent fluctuations of each residue in a protein, which provides information about its flexibility. The RMSF values can be used to identify regions of the protein that are more flexible or rigid, which can be important for understanding its function and stability. Similarly, to study the ligand-induced flexibility/rigidity of protein residues, RMSF was calculated (Figure 2). RMSF plot of all the simulated systems showed the variable fluctuations of amino acid residues with almost similar magnitude. The terminal helix region (from Leu627 to Val656) was most fluctuated in all the systems. However, the crucial residues including Asn536, Thr537, and Met579 were found to be rigid throughout the whole simulation. However, Phe466 was found to be highly fluctuated in all systems in comparison of other crucial residues.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3938 5 of 13Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 13\nFigure 2.

Initially, the molecular interactions between pUL89 and cocrystallized ligand were taken into consideration and essential chemical features were defined [29]. The essential features included two hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrogen bond donor; to interact with two Mn2+ ions and Ser473, one aromatic and one hydrophobic feature to interact with Asn536, Thr537, Met579 and Phe466. The five selected features were defined as 3D query to search potential virtual hits with the similar chemical features from ZINC and ChEMBL databases. In the first step all the prepared ~0.7 million compounds were screened against the defined query. In the second step, the resultant ~400 virtual hits were subjected to molecular docking-based screening. The crystal structure of UL89 (PDB ID 6EY7) was utilized for docking simulation. The docking grid was defined by selecting the atomic coordinates of the cognate ligand and the obtained virtual hits in the first steps were docked into the defined site. The Triangular Matcher was used as a placement method with induce fit docking protocol. For each compound maximum of ten conformations were generated and five best were retained. The resultant poses were scored using London dG and GBVI/WSA dG as scoring and rescoring function, respectively. Afterwards, the compounds were shortlisted based on the docked score of cognate ligand and as a result 136 compounds were selected for further analysis. In the next step, the top ranked compounds were prioritized based on the shape-similarity of pUL89 known inhibitors using the TGD (topological and geometrical descriptors) based on its ability to effectively capture the structural diversity and complexity of chemical compounds. The obtained virtual hits were searched for the similar shape with that of selected known inhibitors. As a result, 28 compounds were filter out with the Tanimoto similarity coefficient >0.75. In the final step, the compounds were visually analysed for hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the crucial residues, Mn2+ chelation and complementarity between ligand and the binding site of the pUL89.

The therapeutic management of CMV entails the use of antiviral drugs and vaccines. The current therapeutics are associated with a number of side effects. Moreover, many CMV strains are emerged that have developed resistance to these therapeutic interventions. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop potential drug candidates against CMV. In this study we identified potential lead compounds against pUL89 of HCMV with different chemical scaffold from the previously reported inhibitors. In the multistep virtual screening integrated with structure and ligand-based drug design approaches we determined seven virtual hits against the target protein from commercially available ZINC and ChEMBL database. Among these three compounds were further evaluated by MD simulation. The results demonstrated the significant stability of the target protein upon binding of the compounds with similar type of interactions like the previously known inhibitors with low micromolar activity. Overall, these in silico findings can be used for further in vitro studies to validate the antiviral potential of these compounds against CMV.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3938 11 of 13\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28093938/s1, Figure S1: Workflow of virtual screening; Figure S2: RMSD, RMSF and Rg of three replicas of 100ns MD simulation for Apo pUL89; Figure S3: RMSD, RMSF and Rg of three replicas of 100ns MD simulation for pUL89/SK-1 complex; Figure S4 RMSD, RMSF and Rg of three replicas of 100ns MD simulation for pUL89/SK-2 complex; Figure S5: RMSD, RMSF and Rg of three replicas of 100ns MD simulation for pUL89/SK-7 complex; Table S1: Comprehensive detail of selected virtual hits against HCMV including chemical structures and results of docking studies.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.A.(Mohammed Aladhadh), I.U.H., A.A.A., N.S.A. and J.U.; methodology, O.A., F.M.A., M.A. (Mamdouh Allahyani) and A.S.; software, A.A., M.A. (Mamdouh Allahyani), R.T.A. and N.S.A.; validation, M.A. (Mazen Almehmadi); data curation, A.S. and O.A.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.A. (Mazen Almehmadi) and J.U.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.A.A.; funding acquisition, M.A. (Mazen Almehmadi).
