            "text": "Gastric ulcer (GU) is one of the most common diseases affecting humans. An unbalance in defense factors and detrimental factors is the primary cause of GU, which is characterized by rhythmic epigastric pain after eating (1, 2). Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a Gram-negative bacterium that selectively colonizes the epithelium of the gastric mucosa (3). It is a common bacterial infection in the world and infects more than 50% of the world\u2019s population (4). Approximately, 75% of GUs are caused by H. pylori (5). It is known that H. pylori is a carcinogen, and H. pylori-related GUs have also been linked to gastric cancer (6, 7). An infection caused by H. pylori must be eradicated medically, as the bacteria relapse easily. Bismuth, antibiotics, and the inhibition of gastric acid secretion are usually used to treat GUs caused by H. pylori (8\u2013 10). H. pylori has become more resistant to antibiotics, making eradication increasingly difficult (11). Nowadays, GU caused by H. pylori infection has become an important issue. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a statistical analysis of the research status, hotspots, and trends of H. pylori-related GUs.\nIn bibliometric analysis, the literature is identified, developmental trends are clarified both objectively and visibly, the current status is determined, and the future development of the field is predicted (12). Bibliometrics is widely used in oncology, ophthalmology, complementary medicine, alternative medicine, and other interdisciplinary fields of medicine (13, 14). However, bibliometric studies on H. pylori-related GU are still absent. In this study, we conducted bibliometric research on H. pylori-related GU papers that were published from 2012 to 2022 and analyzed the research status, hotspots, and trends in the field. This study will hopefully provide valuable information and aid in future research on GU-related H. pylori.\nA major objective of this article was to review the current research status and hotspots of H. pylori-related GU and to propose research directions for the future. By using bibliometric analysis software, such as VOSviewer and CiteSpace, these questions were addressed through the following goals: (a) the number and timing of publications; (b) journals, institutions, and countries of publications; (c) domains of study; (d) citation and co-citation of publications; and (e) keywords used in publications."

The bibliometric software, such as VOSviewer and CiteSpace, were\nused to visually analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of literature, keywords, and the citations and co-citations of publications. Additionally, VOSviewer and CiteSpace were used to clarify the research status, hotspots, and trends of H. pylorirelated GU. This article aimed to provide a reference for researchers in the field of gastrointestinal diseases.\nResearch status of Helicobacter pylori-related gastric ulcer\nIn total, 2,971 articles were included in our analysis. H. pylori-related GU papers showed an increasing trend between 2012 and 2022, and researchers have been paying close attention\nFrontiers in Medicine 08 frontiersin.org\nto it. Among the 115 countries that have published a paper on H. pylori-related GU, China was certainly the most productive country, followed by the United States, and Japan. The largest\nnumber of publications in China indicated that H. pylori-related GU has a high incidence rate in China, which may be related to the eating habits of the Chinese. In terms of affiliations, Baylor\nFrontiers in Medicine 09 frontiersin.org\nFrontiers in Medicine 10 frontiersin.org\nCollege of Medicine had the highest number of publications, citations, and H-index. Three of the top five agencies were from the United States, indicating that the United States has a strong academic ability in the field.\nIn the field of H. pylori-related GU, the United States has the highest citation and H-index, indicating it has the greatest influence. This apparent superiority might be attributed to the leading academics with advanced research facilities and technologies. Although China has the highest number of publications, the number of citations was close to Japan and Germany. This means that Germany and Japan had a higher quality of research on H. pylori-related GU, and Chinese researchers should improve the quality of their work.\nAn article with a high IF is considered to be of higher quality when it appears in a journal. The journals were mainly in the gastroenterology and hepatology, microbiology, and pharmacology and pharmacy fields. In the field of H. pylorirelated GU, fewer articles were published in journals with high IF. The World Journal of Gastroenterology published the most in H. pylori-related GU studies, and it was also the second most cited journal. There is no doubt that this journal played a crucial role in studying H. pylori-related GU. Remarkably, the GUT ranked first in terms of citations with 13 publications, and the Gastroenterology ranked fifth with five publications. Researchers interested in this field should pay closer attention to these journals since the articles in these journals were of high quality.\nThe most productive author, Yamaoka Y, has published 47 papers on H. pylori-related GU fields and received 1,024 citations. Yamaoka Y mainly studies the virulence factors of H. pylori and its mechanism of action (27). Based on the author\u2019s highest-cited article, there are differences in virulence factors of H. pylori in different regions, and the pathogenicity of H. pylori is correlated with virulence factors (28). In addition to being the second most cited author, Graham DY from the United States was also the author with the largest citation. Graham DY focuses primarily on the epidemiology and treatment of H. pyloriassociated ulcers, and in one of his highest-cited articles, he followed up patients with ulcers who participated in randomized controlled trials to cure ulcers for 2 years and found that triple therapy could reduce ulcer recurrence rates and that most peptic ulcers associated with H. pylori infection were curable (29). In another highly cited paper, Graham DY pointed out that the effectiveness of clarithromycin-containing triple therapy in the treatment of H. pylori was reduced and proposed treatment suggestions and follow-up clinical experimental research directions for this condition, which provided great help for the treatment and clinical research of H. pylori (30)."

            "text": "Articles with high citations can reflect the issues of concern in a research field. The papers written by Malfertheiner P\npublished in the GUT in 2012 and 2017 were ranked first and third in GCS. In those two Consensus Reports, the author and experts made recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of H. pylori, which provided support for clinicians in the treatment of H. pylori-related disease (21, 23). A paper written by Hooi JKY published in Gastroenterology in 2017 ranked second. Through the systematic review and meta-analysis, the authors found that there were differences in infection rates in different countries/regions and that more than half of the world\u2019s population was infected with H. pylori (31). It suggested that the prevention and treatment of H. pylori have always been a hot issue in this field.\nThe keywords and co-cited references timeline view can reflect hotspots in the field of H. pylori-related GU research. It can be seen from the co-cited references timeline view that eradication therapy and immunotherapy were the common concerns in H. pylori-related GU. Lim JH and his team found that the efficacy of levofloxacin-based 3-line eradication therapy for H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers was similar to that of first/second-line eradication therapies (32). Fahimi F and his team showed the importance of VacA in the pathogenesis of H. pylorirelated diseases and discussed the potential and possibility of VacA as a targeted immunotherapy for the treatment of H. pylori (33). In the keyword clustering timeline view, risk factors and antibiotic resistance are more concerning to researchers. Harris RB and his team studied H. pylori infection in the Three Navajo Nation Chapter Communities and found that H. pylori infection in the region was associated with households and the use of uncontrolled water sources (34). Le LTT determined that the H. pylori resistance rates were 80.6% for clarithromycin, 71.7% for amoxicillin, 49.4% for metronidazole, 45.1% for levofloxacin, and 11.4% for tetracycline, especially in children who had previously received H. pylori eradication treatment (35).\nAs H. pylori-related GU disease research continues to progress, the research hotspot is changing as well. Co-cited references with the most bursts, keyword average year view, and emergence map show hot issues and directions in current research. The cited literature studies in the past 5 years have highlighted the main research directions for H. pylori-related GU and are listed as follows: the treatment of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori-related Gus (23, 24), the pathogenesis of H. pylori (25), and the prevention and treatment of complications caused by anti- H. pylori therapy (26). Among the keywords mentioned more frequently over the past few years were oxidative stress, probiotics, competitive acid blocker, vonoprazan, gut microbiota, and neutrophil-activating protein. Vonoprazan is a competitive acid blocker that inhibits gastric acid secretion by binding competitively to the proton pump with potassium ions (36). The study by Ashida et al. (37) and his team showed that vonoprazan-based triple therapy is safe and effective. Through a review, Butcher LD discussed how oxidative stress can cause H. pylori infections. Based on oxidative stress mechanisms, Silvan JM and his team explored a treatment method for\nFrontiers in Medicine 11 frontiersin.org\nH. pylori infection (38, 39). Studies have shown that the fixed value of H. pylori is related to the gastric microbiota, which shows a decrease in gastric microbial diversity and an increase in the relative abundance of bacteria (40, 41). In the research conducted by Devi et al. (42), bifidobacterium was found to be associated with H. pylori infection and to protect against H. pylori-associated stomach disorders. Research by Zhao et al. (43) found that neutrophil-activating proteins are responsible for promoting H2O2-induced biofilm formation in bacteria, which makes them multidrug resistant. Based on these keywords, it can be seen that H. pylori-associated GU research is focused on pathogenesis and treatment. There is no doubt that future studies will continue to focus on H. pylori pathogenesis and the efficacy and safety of therapeutic drugs."
