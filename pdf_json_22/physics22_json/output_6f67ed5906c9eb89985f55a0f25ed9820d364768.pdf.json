Eggert 3\nThe structures, strain fields, and defect distributions in solid materials underlie the mechanical and physical properties across numerous applications. Many modern microstructural microscopy tools characterize crystal grains, domains and defects required to map lattice distortions or deformation, but are limited to studies of the (near) surface. Generally speaking, such tools cannot probe the structural dynamics in a way that is representative of bulk behavior. Synchrotron X\u2011ray diffraction based imaging has long mapped the deeply embedded structural elements, and with enhanced resolution, dark field X\u2011ray microscopy (DFXM) can now map those features with the requisite nm\u2011resolution. However, these techniques still suffer from the required integration times due to limitations from the source and optics. This work extends DFXM to X\u2011ray free electron lasers, showing how the 1012 photons per pulse available at these sources offer structural characterization down to 100 fs resolution (orders of magnitude faster than current synchrotron images). We introduce the XFEL DFXM setup with simultaneous bright field microscopy to probe density changes within the same volume. This work presents a comprehensive guide to the multi\u2011modal ultrafast high\u2011resolution X\u2011ray microscope that we constructed and tested at two XFELs, and shows initial data demonstrating two timing strategies to study associated reversible or irreversible lattice dynamics.\nAcross materials science\u2014from dislocation junctions strengthening materials to interstitial defects fracturing batteries over many charge cycles\u2014defects change how materials respond to their surroundings1,2. Point defects are routinely used to finely tune material properties3, and defects extending across many unit cells (mesoscale) can tune\u00a0the properties and performance of thermal or electronic materials, among others4,5.

Similarly, in metals grain boundaries\u00a0and dislocation networks govern bulk properties such as strength and ductility7. At this time, our understanding and control of mesoscale defects and domains in bulk materials is primarily limited by our ability to probe their dynamics in a manner that is representative of bulk properties8. The multiscale defect or grain\u00a0structures often encountered imply that sample thicknesses of tens or hundreds of micrometers are required for representative sampling. Electron microscopy, field-ion microscopy and atom probe tomography can resolve defect cores with atomic resolution. However, they are intrinsically near surface probes and they rely on long raster scans to generate 3D maps, during which sample conditions must be fixed9,10. Without insitu measurement tools that can resolve how mesoscopic defects with nanometer cores interact to form large 3D networks that evolve over hundreds of micrometers, our understanding of the dynamics has been limited to theory that is yet untested at the microscopic scale.\nThe primary challenge in detecting the mesoscopic structure lies in the wide range of length- and time-scales that must be probed to fully interpret the system. Lattice defects are comprised of local disruptions in the crystal packing\u2014either a truncated plane (dislocation),\u00a0or missing/extra atom (vacancy, interstitial), or truncated domain of the crystal (grain boundary). While the cores of defects have \u00a0\u00c5-nm lengthscales, the long-range distortions from them that span micrometers to millimeters map key interactions that alter the macroscopic properties5,11,12. When these defects interact, the velocity of the property-transforming events can span from ballistic dynamics (ps-ns) through cumulative degradation (months to years), spanning > 15 decades of timescales. A measurement tool to spatially and temporally resolve the evolution of plasticity in-situ and, specifically, the interactions between adjacent strain or defects, requires sub-nanosecond imaging with nm-resolution13,14.\nX-rays have been demonstrated to have the necessary penetration power to access this regime. The information encoded in these X-ray images is dictated by the material attribute responsible for the light-matter interaction that produces the beam being imaged.\u00a0Based on their contrast mechanisms, X-ray microscopes can largely be divided into three modalities: spectral imaging, monochromatic phase/amplitude imaging, and diffraction-contrast microscopy13. Spectral imaging gives contrast that delineates the elemental composition and sometimes the oxidation state, by scanning a microscopy measurement across an absorption or emission band of the material. Monochromatic X-ray microscopy at photon energies far from an absorption or emission peak have contrast mechanisms described by the amplitude (e.g. radiography) or phase (e.g. ptychography) of the light that has traversed the material. Those techniques offer information about the density, thickness, and porosity of the material. Finally, diffraction contrast microscopes map heterogeneity in the crystallography of the sample.\nWhile the contrast mechanism defines the materials-specific information contained in X-ray images, the resolution vs field of view are set by the imaging optics. Scanning microscopy is performed by focusing the X-ray beam to a small spot, then rastering the spot across the sample to collect spatially-mapped signals; for this approach, the resolution is set by the beam\u2019s spot size while the field of view is set by the number of points in the scan. Tomographic microscopy requires a different approach to raster scans, collecting images from different rotational perspectives for a roughly cylindrical sample volume; the corresponding image stacks are compiled and Radon transformed to form the full 3D imaged volume. By contrast, full-field imaging collects information about the entire sampling volume in a single acquisition, with projections along one of the three sample dimensions. Near-field imaging (e.g. radiography, topography) captures full-field images\u00a0very close to the sample, with a field of view limited by the detector or beam size\u00a0and a resolution set by the Fresnel number of the image features. Magnified imaging with focusing optics that\u00a0map\u00a0the object onto its image plane in the far-field. Images collected along the X-ray transmitted beam (transmission X-ray microscopy, TXM) are collected along the bright-field (BF), and map the attenuation of the beam from absorption (and XRD in special cases). Conversely, images collected along the diffracted beam are produced by the X-rays scattering off of the undisrupted periodicity native to a given\u00a0lattice plane, thereby mapping the crystallographic information along a specific symmetry of a crystal. These types of dark-field (DF) images result in spatial maps of the disruptions to crystalline order in the lattice (i.e. the defects).\nSo called\u00a0Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a full-field magnified microscope\u00a0that acquires images by placing an X-ray objective lens along the X-ray diffracted beam. DFXM captures crystallographic distortions, i.e. the strain and mosaicity of the lattice, with a spatial resolution of 30-150 nm, with strain resolution of 10\u22125 and mosaicity (orientation) resolution of 10\u22123 radians. Recent work has used DFXM to characterize deformation texture15, dislocation structures16, domain boundary migration in ferroelectrics17, fatigue in polycrystalline metals18, among other phenomena. We recently established time-resolved DFXM at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) and demonstrated its utility with a first-ever study of collective dislocation dynamics deep inside bulk aluminum from 97 to 99% of the melting temperature19. Today, DFXM has a temporal resolution that is limited by the integration time required to acquire the images with synchrotron radiation; access to material dynamics at sub-microsecond timescales requires more brilliant X-ray sources.\nThe time resolution of X-ray microscopy tools is dictated by the acquisition scheme used for the measurement. For reversible and reproducible dynamics, a pump-probe modality may be used, whereby a \u201cpump\u201d excites a\u00a0material into a transient state then probe at some time-delay afterwards interrogates the relaxation of that state over fs-ps timescales, via millions of successive excitations that span all pump-probe delays\u00a0and appropriate\u00a0signal averaging. By contrast, irreversible processes require single-shot acquisitions with sufficiently high frame rates and signal to noise that they may gather all the relevant information about the system in the time that follows a single excitation pulse. Full-field imaging approaches are required to study irreversible processes.\nSince the development of high-photon-energy (a.k.a. \u201chard\u201d) X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs), ultrafast X-ray science has had breakthroughs across physics, engineering, biology and beyond as optical and synchrotron techniques have become achievable with single-shot acquisition capabilities20. With 1012 photons per pulse, XFELs have shifted static techniques that were hindered by their integration times to now become possible via\u00a0ultrafast\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:17573 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35526-5\npump-probe measurements using\u00a0femtosecond single-shot measurements could overcome issues of collection time and cumulative radiation damage21. For structural imaging, holography and X-ray coherent diffractive imaging (XCDI) have demonstrated this type of spatiotemporal resolution at XFEL sources22,23, but the necessary apertures and foci at the sample\u00a0have prevented these methods from capturing a\u00a0sufficiently large fieldof-view to capture statistical populations of nanoscale features24. While Bragg-XCDI has been able to spatially resolve the strain fields in nanoparticles25, the same lattice-resolution measurements have not been extended to real-space X-ray imaging. XFEL imaging in real-space (i.e. in x,\u00a0y,\u00a0z coordinates as opposed to XCDI\u2019s Fourier transformed\u00a0raw images) has only been performed in the transmitted beam with associated density contrast26. This makes it insensitive to the sparse defects or anomalous strain fields\u00a0that initiate plastic transformations or other macroscopic processes. To statistically probe the distortions that initiate large-scale material transformations, we need a technique with high spatiotemporal resolution and a large field-of-view that is sensitive to both density variation and localized strain fields inside the crystals.\nTo address this challenge, in this work, we introduce DFXM at XFELs and present a multi-modal\u00a0setup that enable simultaneous density mapping using BFXM (in the TXM geometry). Using 32-fs X-ray pulses, local structural information is probed 13\u00a0orders of magnitude faster than previously accessible19. From experiments first at the the Pohang Accelerator Lab (PAL, 2019) and then at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS, 2021), we present the instrumentation we have developed to build, align, acquire data, and analyze the results from the XFEL version of DFXM. To enhance the information-content of each frame and enable single-shot acquisitions of irreversible systems, we include simultaneous bright- and dark-field X-ray microscopy (BFXM & DFXM), as they afford complementary information about the strain states and defect populations in sample. In these experiments, we benchmark our measurements using diamond single crystals. We first present our instrument design, including important trade-offs that must be considered when designing XFEL-DFXM experiments. We then present the analysis approaches we used for our data analysis, and present the types of data that may be collected at each of our 4 detectors in the imaging setup. We conclude with a discussion about the future opportunities for this instrument at XFELs around the world, across many fields of science.\nDark\u2011field X\u2011ray microscopy design The DFXM geometry and the real- and reciprocal-space coordinate systems as used at synchrotrons are defined in Refs.27,28. In this section, we introduce the design, coordinate systems, and axes for scanning, noting the key differences between the established synchrotron coordinate systems and the XFEL one for clarity. We use the same notation here for consistency, with one main exception related to the direct space: the XFEL is defined to follow the optical conventions that defines the z\u0302\u2113 axis as the beam\u2019s propagation direction\u00a0(in the laboratory\nFigure\u00a01.

The circular plot at the bottom illustrates how the \u00b5 motor is required to rotate all\u00a0scanning stages from their initial orientations, Rx\u2113 , Ry\u2113 , and Rz\u2113 in the laboratory coordinate system, into the rotated sample coordinate system, { xs, ys , zs } for which the diffraction vector Qhkl are aligned to the z\u0302s axis. (b) We also show images from representative points along a rocking-curve, showing intensity indicating the spatial populations of each point along the lattice distortion field for the same spatial plane in the sample. Images in this stack were collected from single-crystal aluminum DFXM at the ESRF synchrotron at ID06-HXM.\n4 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:17573 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35526-5\ncoordinate system). Given the complexity of the DFXM experiments, we detail a conversion from the synchrotron to XFEL systems here. For full understanding of how these coordinate systems convert to intensity and contrast mechanisms, see our previous work27,29,30. The full microscope setup in this orientation is shown in Fig.\u00a01, with diffraction in the horizontal scattering geometry used at XFELs.\nThe analytical form to convert an arbitrary vector v from the laboratory coordinate system used in Ref.27) into the XFEL one described in this work is\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a01, the laboratory coordinate system is defined by {x\u2113, y\u2113, z\u2113} and rotations about those axes, {Rx\u2113 ,Ry\u2113 ,Rz\u2113} , defined by the Poynting vector of the incident beam, ki . When the beam reaches the sample, it interacts with the lattice planes in the relevant grain based on the orientation of the lattice. We have previously defined a crystal coordinate system to describe how the crystallographic vectors, a , b , and c map onto the lab system using {xc , yc , zc} , such that the transform matrix M\u2113\u2212\u2192c converts any arbitrary vector from the lab to crystal system29.\nAfter traversing the sample, the diffracted beam propagates along a diffracted wavevector, \ufffdkd ||z\u0302i , that defines the diffraction imaging coordinate system, {xi , yi , zi} , based on rotation about the y\u0302\u2113 axis.\nWith DFXM, subtle changes to the contrast\u00a0mechanism are provided by minor angular offsets of the diffraction vector from the nominal value for the undeformed lattice Qhkl based on crystal rotations or by varying the scattering angle 2\u03b828. The latter\u00a0motion requires a coherent translation of the far-field (ff) detector and imaging lenses along the 2\u03b8 arc. As can be seen in Fig.\u00a01, a combined 2\ufffd\u03b8-\u03c6 scan will probe the local axial strain. The local variation in crystal\u00a0orientation, as expressed by the pole figure of the reflection (a.k.a. the mosaicity), is probed by varying the goniometer settings, corresponding to rotations Rys and Rzs . These are known as rocking and rolling scan, respectively.\nThe XFEL instrument constraints currently require diffraction in the horizontal scattering plane due to space, polarization, and infrastructure constraints, as shown by the\u00a0orange plane\u00a0in Fig.\u00a01. Since ki and kd are defined in the horizontal plane, the 2\u03b8 value and diffraction plane\u00a0constrains the Qhk\u2113 vector orientations that may be probed for crystals in this microscope. As shown by the blue plane in Fig. 1, the {\u03c9,\u03c7 ,\u03c6} rotation vectors that define the goniometer are explicitly defined in reference to the direction of Qhk\u2113, meaning that they define the relationship between the crystallographic and sample coordinate system. If the sample\u2019s surface normal was already cut with Qhk\u2113 aligned to the surface normal of the crystal, this describes a rotation of \u03b8 about the y\u0302\u2113 axis in the lab system. We note that the sample coordinate system { xs, ys , zs } describes the motorized axes with respect to the sample\u2019s\u00a0surface normal with respect to the goniometer, while a separate crystallographic coordinate system, { xc , yc , zc},\u00a0allows one to account for the crystallographic\u00a0orientation of that sample or grain\u00a0with respect to its uvw vectors\u00a0(scaled inverse of hkl). The components of M\u2113\u2212\u2192s detail the conversion from the rotations about the {x\u2113, y\u2113, z\u2113} system into the goniometer axes, {\u03c9,\u03c7 ,\u03c6} , as is inspired by Busing and Levy31.\nAs in previous work, DFXM can collect image series\u2019 along scans that sample reciprocal space while rotating the crystal about \u03c9 , \u03c7 or \u03c6 ; by translating the lens and detector along 2\u03b8 and \u03b7 ; or by translating the sample along zs . It is worth noting that, while only 2 rotation stages are technically required to access the full sphere of rotation, the precision of this experiment\u2019s high sensitivity necessitates rotation stages about 4 axes for accurate\u00a0scanning. As described in Poulsen et\u00a0al.27,29 a bottom rotation stage, \u00b5 , is required to orient the 3-axis Eulerian cradle ( \u03c9,\u03c7 ,\u03c6 ) to align the \u03c9 rotations to the Qhk\u2113 vector. The vector defining the relationship between each coordinate system is given for the XFEL coordinate system in Table\u00a01. We note that in contrast to the previous work, \u03c7 does not rotate about the incident beam axis, z\u2113 , but instead rotates about an axis that is rotated by an angle of \u03b8 with respect to ki , to ensure the rotations occur about the principal axes of reciprocal space. We note that 2\u03b8 describes the scattering angle probed by the diffracting plane, while 2\ufffd\u03b8 describes the strain scanning axis required to probe the material via \u03b8-2\u03b8 scans."

The PAL-XFEL experiment used a\u00a09.7-keV X-ray pulse\u00a0with \u223c 1011 photons per 32-fs duration\u00a0pulse at a 30-Hz repetition rate; we prefocussed the beam to a 30\u00d710-\u03bcm2 spot at the sample. Our DFXM experiment at LCLS used\u00a0a 10.1 keV photon-energy beam with 1012 photons per 50-fs per pulse at a repetition date of\u00a030 Hz. The energy of each XFEL pulse was calibrated using the Intensity-Position Monitors (IPMs) installed into the XCS hutch, as described in32. The LCLS beam was prefocused using a stack of 1D and 2D Be Compound Refractive Lenses (CRLs) with varied radii of curvature (focusing power), placed 3.435-m upstream of the sample to horizontally focus the beam into a vertical line beam at the sample position. From front to back, the 9-lenslets in the stack were: of two 2D lenses of R = 100-\u03bcm, two 2D lenses of R = 500-\u03bcm, one 1D lens of R = 200-\u03bcm, three 1D lenses of R = 300-\u03bcm, and one 1D lens of R = 500-\u03bcm. In both experiments, the photon flux was calibrated for each pulse\u00a0and\u00a0used to normalize the resulting images to correct for beam fluctuations. Since our first experiment at PAL-XFEL informed our full design for the refined DFXM microscope designed for XFELs, we focus our instrumentation descriptions\u00a0on the setup in full for the latter experiment at LCLS.\nAt the LCLS, our experiment used a channel-cut Si monochromator to reduce the bandwidth to \ufffdE/E \u223c 10\u22124 , with a beam\u00a0divergence of 1.1\u00d7 1.1 \u03bcrad2 . A monochromatic beam with a stable spectrum is essential to be able to acquire interpretable results with DFXM because fluctuations in the incident beam\u2019s photon energy change the d-spacing and orientation that are imaged by DFXM29,30, as we discuss fully in \u201cAlignment strategy\u201d Section. After passing through prefocusing lenses, the resulting beam was apertured further with power slits and then cleanup slits to reduce the size of the focused line beam to its minimum 3.4 \u00d7 3805-\u03bcm dimensions at the sample (as measured via curve fitting of BFXM\u00a0images). To observe the beam positioning and pump-probe overlap, we installed a\u00a0removable scintillator at the sample position and a viewing camera in reflection mode on the upstream side of the sample.\nWhen selecting prefocusing lenses, it is important to\u00a0achieve the narrowest beam waist at the sample position to ensure minimal integration over the observation plane that\u00a0comprises the image. Placing condenser lenses with low focal length near the entry-surface of the crystal achieves the narrowest waist in the x-direction, but can shorten the depth of focus, making the Rayleigh range over which the beam is a constant size much smaller. In general, we have found that at XFELs, the longer prefocusing distances tended to be required due to space constraints, however, this does limit the interpretability of the results in some systems."

Along the transmitted (direct) beam, TXM was installed. The imaging objective was a stack of N = 17 Be 2D CRLs (radius of curvature, R = 50-\u03bcm, distance between lenslet centers, T = 2-mm), corresponding to an effective focal length of 42 cm and a pupil aperture (FWHM) of 261 \u03bcm. The working distance (sample to entry of CRL) was set to d1 = 47-cm while the distance from the\u00a0exit-surface of the CRL\u00a0to the\u00a0detector was d2 = 8.437 -m (total sample-to-detector distance dtot = 8.941-m). From this follows a theoretical magnification of the X-ray beam of M = 18.4\u00d7 . The relevant formalism for calculating the optical parameters are given in27. The stray\u00a0unfocused light was blocked with 600-\u03bcm diameter pinholes at the front and exit surfaces of the CRL stack, cut from 1-mm thick copper.\nFor the DFXM imaging system, the CRL comprised N = 33 Be 2D CRLs ( R = 50-\u03bcm, T = 2-mm), corresponding to an effective focal length of 20 cm and a pupil aperture (FWHM) of 370\u00a0\u03bcm. This objective was aligned with the center of the {111} diffracted beam. With d1 = 23-cm and d2 = 6.532 -m (and total sample-to-detector distance dtot = 6.832-m), the calculated magnification is M = 27\u00d7 . As the larger N stack for the DF imaging system\u00a0produced a smaller effective aperture, we used smaller Cu pinholes of 300-\u03bcm diameter (1-mm thick) at the front and back faces of the stack to remove stray\u00a0unfocussed light.\nLong d2 distances along both imaging systems attenuates the beams significantly if propagating through air. Attenuation was therefore\u00a0mitigated using vacuum beam-tubes that\u00a0spanned the longest possible extent of the d2 beam path, though there was slight attenuation from the 125-\u03bcm thick kapton windows at each end. We placed a 50-\u03bcm thick sheet of aluminium foil at the front surface of our vacuum tube along the BFXM imaging\u00a0arm to avoid saturating the detector with the unattenuated XFEL beam. In our case, the 2\u03b8 = 35\u25e6 limited the need to account for the polarization factor in our microscope design ( P = 0.84 ), however, the coherence of the XFEL beam requires consideration for the polarization factor to ensure optimal signal to noise in the experiment33.\nDiamond single crystals cut with surface normals of [110] were placed into the interaction point with the XFEL beam; the 660-\u03bcm thick crystals were oriented to an angle of 37.5\u25e6 about the Ry\u2113 axis (i.e. rotated about y\u2113 from being normal to the incident X-ray beam) in the direction opposite of the diffracting beam to meet the Bragg condition for the {111} plane. The 1D X-ray beam thus illuminated an angled but nearly planar sheet of 3.4\u00d73805\u00d71151-\u03bcm3 volume in the sample, with the FWHM of the line focus of 3.4 \u03bcm.

At synchrotrons, this is often done either using resolution targets (e.g. Siemens stars, US Air Force Targets, TEM grids, etc.), or by moving translation motors to observe translation of the features on pixels. We note that at XFELs, the motorized approach is often highly inaccurate, as the precision, accuracy, and reproducibility of all motors are not always\u00a0reliable down to the sub-\u03bcm length scales required by this experiment, and are subject to change based on the setup at any given implementation of the setup. As such, we strongly encourage the use of resolution targets, and used TEM grids (200- and 1500-mesh) for this work. Finally, we note the importance of understanding the orientation of the observation plane. As in X-ray topography (XRT), the contrast mechanism giving rise to image signal in DFXM arises from scattering along the\u00a0diffraction vector of the lattice, Qhk\u2113 . That said, the spatial plane that is imaged by DFXM is always rotated by an angle of \u03b8 with respect to the observation plane (as shown in Fig.\u00a03b)."

We used a 12-axis goniometer, using (from top to bottom): 2 piezo motor translation stages (x,\u00a0y) to position each sample of interest into the center of rotation for the rotation stages, 3 rotation stages to mimic an Eulerian cradle with rotation about the z, x, and y axes (i.e. Rx , Ry , Rz ), 3 linear translation stages to center the pre-defined center of rotation into the center of rotation for the CRL carousel, and finally, a 2-axis linear translation stage (x,z) to position the goniometer\u2019s center of rotation into the XFEL interaction point.\nTo simplify CRL alignment and strain scans, we used a motorized 2\u03b8 rail that could independently rotate 3 carriages about its center, as shown in Fig.\u00a02. The radius of this circle was selected based on the imaging distances for 10 keV photon energies and \u223c 33 imaging CRLs, and the baseplate for each carriage was planned to integrate radial translation stages for further focusing of each lens stack. Each carriage was fitted with stage stacks to position the BF and DF stacks of CRLs along their respective ( xi , yi ,Rxi ,Ryi ) axes, as shown in Fig.\u00a02b. The third carousel was used for the near-field alignment camera, though in future this could be used for 2-phase DFXM (i.e. diffractive imaging for a second phase).\nAt the top of the goniometer, we required resolution targets, alignment guides, calibration standards,\u00a0and single crystals for our measurements. For facile motion between these, we used a sample holder with interchangeable custom cartridges that could affix onto a sample holder frame that was stationed at\u00a0the image plane of the microscope; cartridges were designed to hold targets\u00a0either at an arbitrary geometry, or at a\u00a0pre-aligned Bragg condition, depending on the intended use of the samples it intended to hold. The cartridges in our case were machined for high precision positioning, but in future we anticipate they could be 3D printed before or during an experiment for unexpected sample/diffraction\u00a0geometries. Pre-positioning the samples in this way simplified the goniometer design and alignment needs because it limited the range of angular sweeps to \u00b15\u25e6 required to orient the crystals."

Indirect X-ray detection (i.e. conversion of X-ray to optical light\u00a0via scintillator crystals) offers the highest spatial resolution, as the magnification may be amplified by a relay visible-light imaging system\u00a0that offers higher\u00a0fidelity/magnification lenses and smaller pixels sizes on\u00a0the visible-light cameras. However, this comes at the cost of a much lower\u00a0photon detection\u00a0efficiency. The experiments in this work used home-built indirect detectors (similar to those employed in34) for the far-field (FF)\u00a0cameras along both TXM and DFXM arms, using 50-\u03bcm thick Ce:LuAG scintillator crystals (thicker crystals correspond to decreased spatial resolution). Each scintillator crystal was placed into the X-ray image plane, then was relay imaged with \u223c1\u00d7 magnification to form an optical image on the\u00a0visible-light camera. We used an Optem 34-11-10 zoom-lens attached to an Andor Zyla 5.5 sCMOS camera for both detectors, with scintillator-to-lens distances of 285-mm\n8 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:17573 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35526-5\nalong the TXM arm and 130-mm along the DFXM arm. This resulted in an optical magnification of 0.71\u00d7 for the TXM arm and 0.75\u00d7 optical magnification for the DFXM arm. A turning mirror was placed between the scintillator and zoom lens to avoid burning the detector and lens with\u00a0unconverted X-rays. We used both cameras at full resolution, but over a limited ROI that spanned the spatial extent of the scintillator screen to achieve\u00a0detector readout rates of 30-Hz to match the XFEL. Since the light under-filled the\u00a0active area of each detector, this did not limit our field of view in the material.\nFor all detectors in this work, we calibrated the spatial resolution and magnification using TEM grids. For each detector, we placed a TEM grid (200-mesh) at the upstream surface of the scintillator crystal to calibrate the optical magnification based on comparisons to the pixel sizes of each camera. We then calibrated the magnification of each imaging system using an illuminated TEM grid placed at the sample position. As the sample holder (Fig.\u00a02c) held all calibration and imaging samples at the same z-position defining the object plane, we were able to calibrate the BF imaging systems with a bare TEM grid held at normal incidence to the sample, and the DF imaging systems using a TEM grid affixed to the exit surface of a single-crystal of diamond.\u00a0The exit surface was important to avoid effects from dynamical diffraction from hindering the measurement of the diffraction image.\nIndeed beyond the image magnification, the processing of images collected with\u00a0DFXM and XRT require image stretching to account for their projection\u00a0angles. Because diffraction-contrast images are measured along the X-ray diffracted beam, they map the (z,\u00a0y) components of the sample by projecting the illuminated observation plate at the angle 2\u03b8 . While the line-beam simplifies image interpretation, it also necessitates careful calibration of image stretching to correct for this scattering projection, as shown in Figure\u00a03.\nBecause the LADM detector is oriented at normal incidence to the diffracted XFEL beam, the stretch in the images differs from what\u00a0has been described for imaging at ID06 at ESRF (shown in Fig.\u00a03 as z\u0302det2)29. If we consider that the detector orientation at the XFEL is perpendicular to the Bragg-scattered beam ( det1 ), and that the standard detector orientation at ID06 is normal to the direct beam ( det2 ), the appropriate expressions relating the pixel size on the detector pdet to the effective pixel size p0 in the observation plane along z\u2113 is\nas shown graphically in Fig.\u00a03. The effective pixel size along\u00a0the non-stretched direction, y\u2113 , retains\u00a0the equation, pdet = p0y \u00b7M , in both cases. We note that the TEM grids affixed to the exit surface of the diamond crystals necessitate that the resolution calibrations be performed with an additional stretch of the image by a factor of cos \u03b3 to account for the orientation of the crystal\u00a0(also annotated in Fig.\u00a03a).\nFinally, we note the importance of understanding the orientation of the observation plane. As in XRT, the contrast mechanism giving rise to image signal in DFXM arises from scattering contrast along the Qhkl diffraction vector of the lattice. That said, the spatial observation plane that gives rise to DFXM images is always rotated by an angle of \u03b8 about the scattering plane normal with respect to the reciprocal lattice vector of the\u00a0crystal\u2019s diffracting plane. The crystallographic notation in legends for all acquired\u00a0images shown in this work are all offset by the \u03b8 rotation for simplicity, but careful analyses of DFXM images requires calibration for the observation-plane\u2019s orientational offset\u00a0for accurate interpretation."

We detail the steps required for efficient\u00a0alignment that we perfected after\u00a0experiments at PAL-XFEL and then at LCLS below:\n1. With the full 2D beam, align the direct beam to the FF detector to align, position, and calibrate the beam size & optical magnification of the home-built BF detector. 2. Align the CRL assemblies along the x\u2113 and y\u2113 axes (dark-field, DF then bright-field, BF) using the IF alignment camera, with each lens stack placed along the direct-beam to avoid spatial jitter in the beam positioning during alignment. 3.

Align the 1D prefocusing CRLs to achieve the narrowest possible beam waist for the 1D vertical line beam at the sample position (calibrated using a TEM grid at the sample position). Calibrate beam size with magnified and unmagnified images (i.e. with and without the objective) along the direct beam. (Comparison of the magnified and unmagnified images allows one to calibrate the divergence of the XFEL beam) 5. Orient the crystal of interest (or grain of interest in a polycrystal) into optimal Bragg condition along \u03c7,\u03c6 ,\u03c9 directions (intrinsic motor rotations of Rys ,Rxs ,Rzs from bottom to top) using a photodiode, then a NF camera at the DF angle. 6.

Rotate the laterally pre-aligned DF CRLs into the diffracted beam; adjust lateral alignment as needed for accurate positioning on the IF then FF cameras. 8. Focus the DFXM imaging system by translating the DF CRL stack along the z\u0302i direction while monitoring on the DFXM FF camera. Once aligned, calibrate the resolution, field of view, and distortions on the DFXM images using a crystal with a TEM grid affixed to the exit surface of the crystal. 9.

Lateral alignment of DFXM CRLs is particularly challenging at XFELs because of the microscope\u2019s sensitivity; the high X-ray flux and strong interactions can thermally distort the material21. Since DFXM\u2019s high sensitivity to lattice distortions is amplified by the coherence and monochromaticity at XFELs30, even subtle thermal expansions and creep deformations can completely alter the material attributes resolved in DFXM images (by deflecting the diffraction condition). To simplify alignment, we thus performed lateral alignment for both the BF and DF CRL stacks along the more stable direct beam, using a custom circular carousel translation stage that independently rotates three separate carriages about a concentric 2\u03b8 arc around the sample position. This allowed us to easily translate each lens stack between the diffracted and transmitted beams without changing the lateral alignment."

            "text": "The stability of the XFEL beam is important to this experiment because of the sensitive alignment of the microscope and the connection between goniometer angles and contrast mechanism. There are four aspects of the stability of XFEL beams: (1) the Poynting, (2) the spatial mode, (3) the timing, and (4) the spectrum. We detail these points below.\n1. Deviations in the Poynting vector of the incident beam must be < 10% of the beam\u2019s spatial profile; poynting stability is essential to define precise alignment of the < 500-\u03bcm apertures of the CRLs35. For cases with poor spatial stability, we have used a large beam size with a smaller aperture, which converts the spatial instabilities to intensity instabilities. 2. Spatial mode stability is important to ensure that the interpretation of features in images arises from the material and not from the beam. This has been challenging for many XFEL imaging studies36, especially for experiments whose features of interest span a wide range of intensity gradients. The setup described in this work uses the simultaneous images from TXM to self-calibrate for spatial mode and intensity jitter known to be prevalent at XFELs. This effect may in some cases by mitigated by demagnifying the source, but can also be sensitive to aberrations along the undulator and X-ray optics halls. 3. While timing jitter is known to be a challenge at XFELs for sub-100-fs measurements37, the timing stability required for DFXM at XFELs usually would not require the use of those specialized\u00a0timing tools. The time resolution required for each DFXM experiment is dictated by the physics of the material studied and specifically by the velocity of the dynamics as compared to the image\u2019s spatial resolution. For example, to image a 10 km/s wave would traverse a 0.4-\u03bcm pixel in 40-ps, dictating a timing stability of <40-ps would be required to image this wave with a spatial resolution of 400-nm. 4. The spectral stability is perhaps the single most important point for DFXM\u00a0image interpretability. Since dictates the strain states that give rise to contrast in DFXM, the random fluctuations in the photon energy inherent to\u00a0the source causes different d-spacings to diffract through the stationary\u00a0lenses\u2014changing the materials information inherent to the measurement. The high brightness at XFELs stems\u00a0from the\u00a0Stimulated Amplification of Spontaneous Emission (SASE)\u00a0process, which amplifies spontaneous emissions and therefore fluctuates its spectral content\u00a0pulse to pulse across the entire range of the 0.3% bandwith. This significant photon-energy jitter is greater than the 18 eV required to entirely shift (in the present system) the d-spacing that accounts for the image out of the the 286-\u03bcm aperture of the imaging CRL, since 2\u03b8 = f ( , d) . In general, we find that DFXM experiments at XFELs require either a monochromator or a seeded monochromatic beam (i.e. filtering the SASE beam before amplification38) are best to ensure high sensitivity. In highly deformed systems (e.g. shock waves, fracture), the very wide range of strain states present in the material would\u00a0make it advantageous to use the full SASE spectrum to ensure that a sufficient range of strain states are represented to resolve the system. Reversible systems (i.e. those that are feasible to measure with pump-probe experiments) may use signal averaging over many XFEL pulses to mitigate the spectral jitter, though this imposes an unchangeable minimum strain-resolution that would be set by the bandwidth of the SASE spectrum."

When probing reversible dynamics, the range of timescales accessible with XFEL-DFXM is from \u223c50-fs through 1-ms, based on the tools for short-time calibration (minimum \u0394t) and the repetition rate of the XFEL (maximum\u00a0\u0394t). To probe irreversible dynamics requires single-shot acquisitions in a bunch train, and is thus dependent on the inter-pulse spacing available at the XFEL and the detector readout rate. The range of lengthscales is more complex; the spatial resolution of the microscope is \u223c1-\u03bcm in this work, but will likely be higher by using higher magnification focusing elements, as has been demonstrated at up to 30-nm resolution\u00a0at synchrotrons39. As noted in Beam Stability, the lengthscale of the information that must be\u00a0resolved by the technique depends on the velocity and/or rate of the\u00a0dynamics in material being studied.\nSingle\u2011frame images with ultrafast high\u2011resolution X\u2011ray microscopy (U\u2011HXM) instrument For every pulse generated by the XFEL, the U-HXM instrument\u2019s data acquisition (DAQ) system saves the: (1) pulse energy, (2) goniometer\u00a0stage positions, (3) TXM image of the line beam, and (4) DFXM image related to the elastic distortion states. As DFXM is a full-field microscope, each pulse produces a full real-space\u00a0image on the camera; with beam tubes in place, we found that\u00a0generally, a \u223c1-mJ pulse energy gave DFXM and TXM images with appropriate signal-to-noise for single-shot\u00a0acquisition.\u00a0A full comparison of the different types of images collected along the BF and DF imaging arms is shown in Fig.\u00a04, illustrating the change in resolution vs field of view afforded by each imaging modality.\nThe pulse energy measured from the upstream monitors\u00a0informs the incident intensity required to normalize the\u00a0signal intensity, while the goniometer angles catalogue the information required to interpret the microstructure and displacement states being sampled by each DFXM image. It is most effective to monitor the pulse energy with a monitor downstream of the monochromator\u00a0due to the spectral jitter of the incident pulse (see Beam Stability section above). If the energy monitor is downstream of the monochromator, it may be used to calibrate the DFXM signal; if the intensity monitor is upstream of the monochromator, an in-line spectrometer is required, or conservation of intensity must be assumed across many averaged pulses between the BF and DF\nFigure\u00a04. Sample images from each detector in the BF (above) and DF (below) imaging\u00a0configurations. The general schematic for BF and DF are shown, with sample images collected in the NF\u00a0(brown), IF (dark green) and FF (light green) shown for each position. NF and IF images are important for validation of the alignment\u00a0of optics along the (x\u2113, y\u2113) plane for BF to complement the (z\u2113, y\u2113) observation\u00a0plane along the DF imaging arm. The FF for each imaging line\u00a0show representative images collected in the weak-beam and strong-beam conditions to illustrate the feature contrast (DF) and Borrmann fan (BF), respectively. The BF images at the NF and IF positions show the 2D square beam, while the FF image for BF shows the line beam. We note that the IF image\u00a0along BF is a screenshot and should thus\u00a0only be considered qualitatively.\n12\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:17573 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35526-5\nimages in the FF. We note that future DFXM experiments may benefit from the new seeded monochromatic capabilities at XFELs, which produce low-bandwidth pulses with higher photon flux38.\nAs described above, images collected in the FF along the BF may comprise information on density variations but are also important to calibrate the DFXM images. As shown in Fig.\u00a04, the line beams collected from the BF camera can provide information about the spatial mode of the XFEL beam, the amount of dynamical diffraction occurring in DFXM, and context about the non-diffracting regions of the crystal (e.g. beam damage, phase transitions, etc.). In samples with no significant density variation, the TXM images can calibrate the fluctuations in the spatial mode of the XFEL, allowing one to correct for artifacts from the illumination. The TXM can also be helpful as a guide to quantify the amount of dynamical diffraction that occurs in a given diffraction condition (see TXM in Strong-Beam in Fig.\u00a04). For nearly perfect crystals of sufficient thickness, dynamical diffraction (multiple scattering) causes the line-beam to scatter multiple times; for even numbers of scattering, the beam remains along the kd wavevector, while an odd number of scattering events returns the beam back to\u00a0the ki\u00a0wavevector. In both cases, the beam is translated from its initial position due to these multiple scattering events. This effect, termed the Borrmann effect40, makes the TXM line beam spread out laterally, as ghost-fringes appear next to the primary beam. Information about the extent of dynamical diffraction can be helpful in understanding how to interpret image features with DFXM, as they also complicate signal in DFXM images. Finally, the TXM images give important information about the structure and its evolution in the entire illuminated region of the sample. Notably, DFXM is designed to image the specific part of the crystal that gives rise to scattering over a narrow range of reciprocal space, giving it very high resolution\u00a0in real and reciprocal space. In general it does not provide any information on other material phases and grains that are\u00a0oriented differently, as there is\u00a0either no diffraction signal or the diffraction occurs at angle not compatible with the DFXM settings. With simultaneous density contrast that images these \u201cmissing regions,\u201d TXM gives a complementary view of the material, giving important context for interpretation of the\u00a0DFXM images.\u00a0At the PAL-XFEL, we also measured simultaneous wide-angle X-ray diffraction on the side opposite from the DF beam (mirrored across the BF beam), however, we do not include this in the presentation in this work, as that data was not meaningful without a phase transition or breakup of the crystal grains to observe. In future experiments, simultaneous diffraction can be helpful for interpretation of multi-phase and/or polycrystalline changes to the material.\nAs described in Poulsen et\u00a0al.29, each raw DFXM image contains bright and dark features that map specific components of the crystallography, detailing components of the strain and orientation states along the lattice plane being measured, hk\u2113 . The content of these images is related to the spatial derivatives of the elastic displacement fields, which includes information about defects in materials and distortion waves like phonons, shock waves, and heat41.\nOverview of DFXM scanning modalities While significant insights may be gathered by time-resolving single-frames with DFXM,\u00a0full information about dynamics of interest with DFXM\u00a0require\u00a0scans along the parameters outlined in Table\u00a02. A full DFXM scan is collected by measuring images at a series of different motor positions, photon energies, and/or times as described in Table\u00a02. Strain and orientation scans probe different populations of reciprocal space in a region around the diffraction vector; alternatively this is presented in terms of axial strain and orientation (a local pole figure). The 3D and time scans capture the same structural information as a function of position and time, respectively (without changing the contrast mechanism). In most experiments, a combination of these scans are performed, where some combination of structure and dynamics are measured at a series of positions across different axes of a crystal\u2019s diffraction extent (rocking or rolling curve).\nFor strain and orientation scans, each image spatially maps the populations of displacement fields that\u00a0meet the Bragg condition at that position in reciprocal space, within the reciprocal-space resolution function of the microscope (as shown in Fig.\u00a01b). As described fully in Jakobsen et\u00a0al.16 images collected at the brightest point of a rotational scan display the entire extent of the undeformed grain of the crystal\u00a0domain, and define the strong-beam condition. Images collected at microscope settings at the edges of the rotational\u00a0scan only describe specific anomalous\u00a0types of distortions in the lattice, showing the\u00a0defects or other sparse structural features in the sample; these images define the weak-beam condition. The nomenclature in this terminology was selected in analogy to dark-field TEM experiments in electron microscopy. At XFELs, the time-resolved scanning capabilities introduce another set of displacement states not described in previous DFXM work: temporally weak-beam states. We use this term to denote new weak-beam distortion states that populate during the transient dynamics probed by the experiment, but that are not populated at t < 0 , before the pump pulse.\nStrain scans are typically acquired at the synchrotron by collectively moving\u00a0the detector and CRL stages coherently along the 2\u03b8 arc of the diffracting crystal. While the dedicated instruments at synchrotrons make this approach viable, the extra setup requirements at XFELs make it simpler to hold the entire experiment stationary, scanning the d-spacing with small changes to the photon energy for . For the case of probing diamond (111) planes by an X-ray pulse of E = 10.1 keV and \ufffdE/E = 10\u22124 , a single X-ray pulse with a bandwidth of E = 1 eV covers a narrow range of \u03b4d = 2\u00d7 10\u22125-nm and 2\u03b4\u03b8 = 0.004\u25e6 .

This range of strain scanned by changing photon energy is equivalent to that scanned by changing scattering angle for 2\ufffd\u03b8 = 0.03\u25e6.\u00a0Strain scans were not performed in this work, but we include this description for future users\u2019 benefit in planning experimental capabilities.\nThe reciprocal-space resolution function for DFXM is highly anisotropic, with the beam divergence accounting for the highest sensitivity in q ; this effect is amplified by\u00a0the coherence of the\u00a0 XFEL30. To map different strain components, it is\u00a0thus important to consider the orientation of the lattice in relation to the axis of the resolution function, as is discussed fully in28,29, to ensure the appropriate match between the microscope\u2019s resolution and material\u2019s displacement fields.\nDifferent types of dynamics are more suitable to study in the strong-beam or weak-beam condition based on the grain sizes and the spatial population of states present. In past, we have found defect measurements in low-defect density materials are easiest to interpret in the weak-beam conditions. For highly\u00a0deformed crystals, the local orientation changes are typically much larger than the Darwin width and the diffracted signal can be interpretable when acquired in the strong-beam condition. At the XFELs, the temporally-weak condition will be most helpful to study dynamics\u00a0in many samples and conditions. While the temporally-weak beam condition is usually the easiest data to interpret during an experiment, however,\u00a0those data often lack sufficient information about the initial microstructural features in the sample that inform\u00a0how\u00a0and why those dynamics\u00a0began. As such, we suggest a balance between strong, weak, and temporally-weak conditions when planning for XFEL-DFXM studies.\nWhen studying dynamics at the XFEL, it is important to consider the tradeoffs between different approaches. For irreversible processes, real-time images must be collected to capture the dynamics of a material as it changes\u2014this approach will always be limited by the camera acquisition speeds (frame rate and shutter speed), the inter-pulse separations for timing sequences, and the data transfer rates that are possible for the data acquisition system. Optical fibers for rapid\u00a0data transfer are essential to achieve sufficient data transfer rates for the high-resolution and high dynamic range detectors required to acquire the full content of DFXM images (>12 bit-depth per pixel). From our experience, the U-HXM instrument performs best when each camera is connected to its own data-transfer line to enable parallel data transfer capabilities. From our experience, the 1012 photons per pulse available at the XFEL are indeed able to acquire sufficient signal-to-noise for single-shot acquisitions, however, for weak-beam conditions, this can introduce significant challenges in interpretation (e.g.\u00a0Fig.\u00a05b). Our experiments at the PAL-XFEL observed damage bands appearing in diamond after 20,000 pulses of the XFEL ( \u223c14.3 Gy of radiation absorbed, assuming 0.1-mJ/pulse), however, the low intensity at the DFXM detector presented challenges in distinguishing this signal from burns to the Kapton tape behind it.\nBy contrast, for crystals exhibiting reversible dynamics, a pump-probe modality may be employed. In that modality, an optical pump laser drives reversible dynamics in the same sample region illuminated by the XFEL probing laser, at a series of time delays, \u03c4pp , that can be stepped through the full dynamics of the system. This approach enables signal averaging over hundreds or thousands of pulses,\u00a0giving results like the image in Fig.\u00a05a, offering much higher signal to noise. The pump-probe approach often requires longer than anticipated acquisition times, as the XFEL pulse may require attenuation to avoid sample damage\u00a0over the long duration scans. The example image in Fig.\u00a05a showing a strain wave propagating in diamond, generated by laser irradiation of the gold surface transducer layer\u00a0as discussed in41.\nFigure\u00a05. Raw data showing DFXM images captured\u00a0at (a) LCLS using pump-probe acquisition mode, and (b) the PAL-XFEL using\u00a0real-time image acquisition. The image in (a) shows an integrated image of a strain wave traversing a diamond single-crystal, while (b) shows the incipient beam damage after 20,000 pulses from the XFEL at PAL-XFEL. We note that the crystallographic legends shown in all images are rotated by an angle of \u03b8 = 17.5\u25e6 about the vertical axis from the orientations shown. For description of the dynamics of the strain wave images and measurements, see Holstad et\u00a0al.41.\n14\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:17573 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35526-5\nFinally, as presented above, one DFXM image probes a single observation plane in the specimen. A spatial 3D map may therefore be acquired by collecting image stacks while stepping the sample along the x\u2113 axis, though this was beyond the scope of our initial study. We note that the sensitivity of the DFXM microscope requires that the images in such (x,\u00a0y,\u00a0z) scans are collected with rotational scans of at least one tilt axis for each observation\u00a0plane\u00a0to correct for motor drift ( > 0.0005\u25e6 ) or spatial\u00a0changes to the microstructure over the scan\u00a0 volume11. As the reciprocal space resolution function is thinnest in direction \u03c6 , it is natural to perform this additional scan along \u03c6.\nAs an alternative to layer-by-layer mapping, the condenser may be removed an the specimen therefore illuminated by a square shaped beam. The DFXM images then represent a projection, though along a more complex geometry due to the tilted angle of the projection. Similar to classical tomography, 3D mapping may then be facilitated in a tomographic fashion by rotating in \u03c9 around the diffraction vector. This so-called topo-tomographic DFXM modality can give faster 3D information but is more complicated in terms of sampling42.\nIn large crystalline materials, combined analysis of the NF, the IF and FF images is quite helpful. The large difference in the field of view provides context as the NF and IF\u00a0detectors can capture global dynamics occurring in volumes that are outside the field-of-view of DFXM\u00a0(over mm-lengthscales). Changes to the real-space sample (e.g. thermal expansion, fatigue, etc.) would be evident in the NF and IF cameras, showing images that clearly demonstrate a change in the strong-beam image. New components of reciprocal space that populate are most evident at the IF camera, where satellite images may begin to appear to indicate new strain/orientation components that could also be of-interest to DFXM but would require realignment to the new 2\u03b8 and \u03b7 positions.\u00a0In our experiment, we observed images along the IF that showed the strong-beam and the temporally-weak beam signals to identify the position of the temporally weak-beam signal (image not saved)."

For a detailed overview of the analysis, we encourage the reader to explore more thorough guides of specific analysis tools developed in darfix43 and elsewhere11.\nAs in classical XRD, the diffraction condition in DFXM is determined by the conservation of momentum criteria that arise from the sum of the momentum vector for the incident, ki , and diffracted, kd , beams being equal to a lattice vector, Qhk\u2113 . While a perfect crystal would diffract only at a specific value of Q0 , the defects and distortions within the lattice cause additional Qi states to populate as well, mapping the vectors characteristic of the subtle distortions in the lattice spacing and orientation, i.e., the displacement gradient tensor field44. The specific components of the displacement gradient tensor field that contribute to the diffracted signal arise from the crystal\u2019s orientation and the position of the detector. For a full derivation of the contrast mechanism for DFXM, we refer the reader to recent work using ray optics29 and wavefront propagation45 with synchrotron radiation, and XFEL sources30.\nExperimentally, DFXM crystallographic scans are collected by capturing images produced by the crystal when it is rotated to each point along the rocking curve. The corresponding stack of images then has coordinates of (z, y,\u03c7 ,\u03c6, 2\u03b8) (assuming \u03c9 = \u00b5 = 0 ), and may be reconstructed into a single mosaicity map by constructing an image for which each pixel ( zi , yi ) has an intensity, I(zi , yi) , that corresponds to the maximum intensity observed at that pixel throughout the scan, I(zi , yi) = max\u03c7 ,\u03c6,2\u03b8 (I(zi , yi ,\u03c7 ,\u03c6)) , and is plotted with a color, C(zi , yi) , that encodes the \u03c7 ,\u03c6, 2\u03b8 orientation that diffracted with that maximal\u00a0intensity. A schematic is shown in Fig.\u00a01 displays the scanning procedure and associated image sequences, with experimental data to show the characteristic images and reconstructed results\u00a0(collected at the ESRF).\nWe note that the above description of the Center-of-Mass (COM) images is relevant when measuring the average properties of the lattice locally, e.g. measuring the orientation of a local domain. When studying the distortion fields surrounding single defects, the average properties typically wash out the lower intensity signal from defect structures,\u00a0causing\u00a0single images of the weak-beam conditions to be preferable11,16.\nFor static or reversible systems, the detailed mapping accessible from reconstructed DFXM scans along \u03c6 , \u03c7 , and 2\u03b8 would be most important to fully characterize an unknown defect structure that is not well understood. For irreversible systems (e.g. fracture, radiation damage), a crystal grain with sufficiently well-understood defect structures may be measured in real-time, using simulations of all possible defect structures to evaluate the image features appearing in DFXM images collected at only a single crystal orientation. This may be done manually19, or using Bayesian inference for physics-informed image interpretation46.\nGuide for image reconstruction from DFXM scans In this section, we introduce the general approach we used for the image processing treatments, and reconstructions to measure the observables for the basic rotational scans."

For the XFEL beam, we account for the intensity variation on a shot-to-shot basis by integrating DFXM and TXM images over all images for a given microscope condition.

If the BFXM shows a complementary Gaussian curve to the DFXM rocking curve, this confirms that intensity loss arose from only the change in intensity of the XFEL beam, and the multiplier may be deduced from curve-fitting of the integrated intensity rocking-curve functions. If the BFXM shows a complementary Gaussian curve to the DFXM rocking curve, this confirms that intensity loss arose from only the change in intensity of the XFEL beam, and the multiplier may be deduced from curve-fitting of the integrated intensity rocking-curve functions. Because of the noise subtraction, there were pixels with a negative intensity, requiring that all negative values be thresholded to 0 before subsequent processing.\u00a0We note that when plotting these images, it is important to ensure that the minimum and maximum color limits are set carefully, as hot pixels in the image make python/matlab choose poor colormap limits if not set manually. The 1 st and 99th percentile are normally a good choice for the limits of the colormap."

Before starting the comparison between different motor positions of the scan, we first normalize the summed images to account for the intensity variation of the XFEL. Noise in the images collected at angles far from the center of the rocking curve have an outsized impact on the center of mass (COM) calculation, and will bring the COM towards the center of the scan. We reduce the impact of this by setting the intensity of pixels below the nth percentile to zero, or alternately subtracting a fixed value from all pixels before normalization.\u00a0Finally, we then calculate the center of mass by fitting the Ix,y(\u03c6,\u03c7 , 2\ufffd\u03b8) function for each pixel to a Gaussian and taking the weighted average of each pixel for each scanning parameter, as mentioned in the Analysis for U-HXM data section.

The XRT image is highly pixelated, showing a significantly lower spatial resolution, but maps the contextual structure of the crystalline domain across the entire extent of the domain (that passed through the CRL). In this way, XRT provides context at the IF detector for the full crystal information\u2014guiding the imaging alignment and the interpretation of the microstructure in the DFXM images that follow.\nFigure\u00a06b\u2013c show the representative images that may be collected in the FF in the magnified DFXM geometry, showing rotational scan reconstructions from the \u03c7 ( Rx ,Rz ) and the \u03c6 ( Ry ) directions, respectively. Both images map the exact same region of the diamond (though a different one than in XRT) - with a low-angle boundary bisecting the left and right regions of the crystal by an angle that maps between the two rotational directions. While Fig.\u00a06c shows the Ry rotations that map directly to the \u03c6 rotational axis described above, the reconstructed results in Fig.\u00a06b included rotational offsets in Rz to correct for the fact that the Rx rotation shown in Fig.\u00a01 includes components of rotation in \u03c7 and \u03c9 . The Rz corrections were performed by ensuring that the same TEM-grid fiducial appeared over the same pixels in each frame of the rotational scan. As such, the image in Fig.\u00a06b approximates a \u03c7 scan.\nThe results from Fig.\u00a06b\u2013c indicate that the misorientation of the diamond across the boundary in its center is \u223c 5\u00d7 10\u22121 degrees in the \u03c7 direction, and \u223c 6\u00d7 10\u22123 degrees in the \u03c6 direction.

            "text": "Our results in this work demonstrate a new capability for X-ray science that holds opportunities to enhance DFXM from the 0.1 s timescale all the way to the 100-fs timescales. Using the instrument design we describe here, this setup allows for simultaneous multi-beam imaging experiments that can probe multiscale dynamics in materials under a range of different conditions. Using the simultaneous DF and BF imaging (DFXM and TXM, respectively), we have demonstrated a new opportunity to explore the reciprocal space components that underlie a specific feature captured by a TXM image of the material. This is important in applications like fracture or amorphization, in which materials begin to \u201ccloud\u201d in an image collected along the direct-beam because the transmitted beam attenuates from Fresnel and/or Bragg scattering as voids begin forming that instigate the fracture process48. While the BF TXM spatially maps a material\u2019s density by imaging along the transmitted beam (magnified version of radiography), DFXM resolves the local lattice distortions that underlie those density variations. Together, these techniques hold the opportunity to resolve snapshots of how defects and domains (and their associated strain fields) grow, propagate and interact as they cascade into large-scale material dynamics. This work sets the stage for a new host of experiments to study how mesoscale defects deep beneath a material\u2019s surface initiate phase transitions, strengthen materials, modify their physical properties, and beyond, as they respond to external stimuli.\nBeyond the impact of this technique, we also stress the sensitivity of this microscope, and the importance to consider the full scope of preparations required to effectively sample materials with DFXM. We note that effects like dynamical diffraction and phase transformations can introduce uncertainties to the interpretation of the data in ways that require complementary probing methods to be able to interpret.\u00a0We anticipate that future theory papers may explore this interpretation explicitly, enabled by the additional coherence available at XFELs.\u00a0We additionally comment that our choice of CRLs as the focusing optic for the microscopes also holds opportunity for future directions.\u00a0To capture enough of reciprocal space to avoid imaging artifacts, DFXM requires the largest possible numerical aperture, which is limited by the pupil aperture available with X-ray lenses. wWe selected CRLs as the best compromise between flexible effective focal lengths, relatively high pupil apertures, relatively high\u00a0sample-to-lens\u00a0distances, and ease of alignment.\u00a0We note that alternative focusing optics have been explored in the synchrotron DFXM and are a viable future option for XFEL DFXM.\nFinally, we also emphasize that beyond the challenges to building a DFXM instrument from scratch, there are additional considerations required for these experiments at XFELs due to the unique attributes of the source. In the sections above, we have detailed how the XFEL\u2019s polarization, photon energy jitter, and nonuniform spatial modes can add complexity to interpretation if not properly controlled during the experiment. In addition, we also emphasize the importance of considering the damage threshold of the material carefully when designing experiments. Our work did not need to consider beam damage for the pump-probe and static measurements because we used diamond samples for the proof-of-concept measurements, which has the highest known X-ray damage threshold. For other samples, the material\u2019s damage threshold must be compared against the power density of the X-ray beam. As DFXM often is used to resolve dynamics in long-range microstructural features, we often enlarge the microscope\u2019s field of view to lower the power density, however, attenuators may be used for sufficiently high efficiency detectors and/or highly scattering samples.\nThe use of DFXM at XFELs offers new insights into mesoscale materials science, offering complementary information to the current state of the art in XFEL imaging. Current XFEL imaging along the X-ray diffracted beam has been performed for X-ray ptychography and Bragg XCDI49. While X-ray ptychography is often used at synchrotrons to enhance the resolution of XCDI, at XFELs it has been employed primarily for full nano and micro beam characterization50,51. Coherent diffraction imaging has been used extensively at XFELs to image ultrafast structural dynamics in nanomaterials, including acoustic phonons in zinc oxide52, melting in nanoparticles53,\n17\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2023) 13:17573 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35526-5\nand deformations in catalysts54. At synchrotrons, both techniques are leveraged for providing both the amplitude and phase of the diffracted beams, which can give more subtle information about phase-contrast from fine features. Ptychographic analysis and reconstruction was recently extended to DFXM studies55, and may be able to provide this type of information in future implementations of XFEL-DFXM."
