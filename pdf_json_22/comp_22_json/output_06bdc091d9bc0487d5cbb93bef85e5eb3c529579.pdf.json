Introduction. We consider the double saddle-point problem\n(1.1) Aw :=\n  A BT CT\nB 0 0 C 0 \u2212D\n    x y z   =   f g h   =: b,\nwhere A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n and D \u2208 Rp\u00d7p are symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, B \u2208 Rm\u00d7n has full row rank, and C \u2208 Rp\u00d7n. Linear systems like (1.1) arise from many practical applications, such as mixed and mixed-hybrid finite element approximation of the liquid crystal director model [17] and coupled Stokes-Darcy flow [6, 12, 13, 8], and interior methods for quadratic programming problems [19, 9, 10]. We emphasize that (1.1) is importantly different from the block 3\u00d7 3 systems considered by Huang et al. in [15, 14].\nIn principle, (1.1) can be treated as the block 2\u00d72 saddle-point problem\n(1.2)\n( H ET\nE \u2212W )( x y ) = ( f g ) ,\nwhich has been studied for decades [5]. We focus here on splitting iterative methods for (1.1) by fully utilizing the special structure of A. The generalized successive overrelaxation (GSOR) method of Bai et al. [1] is for (1.2) with W = 0. We extend GSOR to (1.1) by introducing three parameters. The convergence analysis of this new GSOR method is quite different from that of stationary methods; we derive convergence conditions based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for all roots of a real cubic polynomial to have modulus less than one. We also analyze a class of block lower triangular preconditioners induced from GSOR and show that all eigenvalues\n\u2217Department of Applied Mathematics, College of Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.

[6] proposed preconditioning techniques by treating (1.1) as system (1.2) with W = 0. Ramage and Gartland Jr. [17] studied a preconditioned nullspace method for solving systems (1.1) that arise from discretizations of continuum models for the orientational properties of liquid crystals, in which they also partitioned A into a block 2\u00d72 form. Recently, based on the special structure of A in (1.1), several preconditioners were proposed to accelerate Krylov subspace methods. Beik and Benzi [2, 3] analyzed several block diagonal and block triangular preconditioners and derived bounds for the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrices. An alternating positive semidefinite splitting (APSS) preconditioner and its relaxed variant were proposed by Liang and Zhang [16] to solve double saddle-point problems arising from liquid crystal director models. The improved APSS preconditioner of Ren et al. [18] and the two-parameter block triangular preconditioner of Zhu et al. [21] were also constructed to deal with the same saddle-point problem. However, the latter preconditioners either do not fully exploit the special structure of A or need to solve several complicated and dense linear systems at each iteration.\nIt is generally difficult to analyze the spectral properties of a \u201cfull\u201d block three-bythree matrix; i.e., one that cannot be reduced to a block 2\u00d72 matrix. Little literature exists on iterative schemes for (1.1). Uzawa-like methods based on the splitting\n(1.3) A =   A 0 0 B \u2212 1\u03b1Q 0 C 0 M  \u2212   0 \u2212BT \u2212CT 0 \u2212 1\u03b1Q 0 0 0 N  \nwere studied by Benzi and Beik [4], where \u03b1 > 0 and the SPD matrix Q are given, and D = N \u2212 M with M negative definite. In addition, given a parameter \u03c9 6= 0, they split A into\nA = 1 \u03c9\n \nA BT 0 B 0 0 \u03c9C 0 \u2212D\n \u2212 1\n\u03c9\n  (1 \u2212 \u03c9)A (1\u2212 \u03c9)BT \u2212\u03c9CT (1\u2212 \u03c9)B 0 0\n0 0 \u2212(1\u2212 \u03c9)D\n \nand proposed a generalized block successive overrelaxation (GBSOR) method. The convergence analysis of these two methods is similar to that of stationary iterative schemes for block 2\u00d72 linear systems, where convergence conditions are derived from a quadratic polynomial equation of the eigenvalues of the iteration matrix. Moreover, GBSOR needs to solve four linear systems at each step: two of the form Ax = r1, one BA\u22121BTy = r2, and one Dz = r3. By partitioning A into system (1.2) with H = A, Dou and Liang [7] construct a class of block alternating splitting implicit (BASI) iteration methods. At each step, BASI needs to solve several linear systems of the form \u03b1I +A+ aBTB + bCTC and \u03b1I +D+ cCCT, where I is the identity and \u03b1, a, b, c are real scalar constants.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present the generalized successive overrelaxation method. In section 3, convergence of GSOR is established under reasonable assumptions. Preconditioners are analyzed in section 4. Numerical experiments are reported in section 5. Conclusions are summarized in section 6.\nNotation. For any S \u2208 Rr\u00d7r, its spectral radius, inverse and transpose are denoted \u03c1(S), S\u22121 and ST , respectively. For any s \u2208 Cr, its conjugate transpose is denoted s\u2217.\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\n2. The generalized successive overrelaxation (GSOR) method. In this section, we present GSOR for solving the double saddle-point problem (1.1). We consider the equivalent unsymmetric system\n(2.1) A\u0302w :=\n  A BT CT\n\u2212B 0 0 \u2212C 0 D\n    x y z   =   f \u2212g \u2212h   =: b\u0302.\nAlthough A\u0302 is unsymmetric, it has certain desirable properties: 1. A\u0302 is semipositive real: vTA\u0302v \u2265 0 for all v \u2208 Rn+m+p. 2. A\u0302 is positive semistable; i.e., its eigenvalues have nonnegative real part. These properties enable convergence of the classical successive overrelaxation (SOR) method [20]. To improve efficiency, we modify the classical SOR method and propose a generalized version that extends the GSOR method considered in [1].\nBy introducing the three matrices\n(2.2) D =   A 0 0 0 P 0 0 0 D   , L =   0 0 0 B 0 0 C 0 0   , U =   0 \u2212BT \u2212CT 0 P 0 0 0 0   ,\nwhere P \u2208 Rm\u00d7m is SPD, we can split A\u0302 as A\u0302 = D \u2212 L \u2212 U .\nLet \u03c9, \u03c4 , and \u03b8 be three nonzero reals, In, Im, and Ip be identity matrices of appropriate order, and\n\u2126 =   \u03c9In 0 0 0 \u03c4Im 0 0 0 \u03b8Ip   .\nConsider the following iteration for (1.1):\nwk+1 = (D \u2212 \u2126L)\u22121[(I \u2212 \u2126)D +\u2126U ]wk + (D \u2212 \u2126L)\u22121\u2126b\u0302(2.3) =: T wk + (D \u2212 \u2126L)\u22121\u2126b\u0302.\nFrom (2.2),\nD \u2212 \u2126L =\n \nA 0 0 \u2212\u03c4B P 0 \u2212\u03b8C 0 D\n  ,(2.4)\n(I \u2212 \u2126)D +\u2126U =\n  (1 \u2212 \u03c9)A \u2212\u03c9BT \u2212\u03c9CT\n0 P 0 0 0 (1\u2212 \u03b8)D\n  .(2.5)\nSubstituting (2.4) and (2.5) into (2.3), we obtain GSOR as stated in Algorithm 2.1. At each step, GSOR needs to solve only three SPD systems (of order n, m, and p). This is easier than in GBSOR [4], which solves four linear systems involving A, A, BA\u22121BT, and D.\nIteration scheme (2.7) can also be deduced from the splitting\n(2.6) A = M\u2212N :=\n \n1 \u03c9A 0 0 B \u2212 1\u03c4 P 0 C 0 \u2212 1\u03b8D\n \u2212   ( 1\u03c9 \u2212 1)A \u2212BT \u2212CT\n0 \u2212 1\u03c4 P 0 0 0 (1\u2212 1\u03b8 )D\n  .\nTherefore, GSOR is a splitting method. In particular if \u03c9 = 1, GSOR reduces to the Uzawa-like schemes studied in [4], where M = \u2212 1\u03b8D and N = ( 1\u2212 1\u03b8 ) D in (1.3).\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\nAlgorithm 2.1 The GSOR method\n1: Choose (x0, y0, z0) \u2208 Rn+m+p, P \u2208 Rm\u00d7m SPD, and \u03c9, \u03c4 , \u03b8 > 0. 2: for k = 0, 1, . . . do 3: Compute (xk+1, yk+1, zk+1) according to the iteration\n(2.7)\n   xk+1 = xk + \u03c9A \u22121(f \u2212Axk \u2212BTyk \u2212 CTzk), yk+1 = yk + \u03c4P \u22121(Bxk+1 \u2212 g),\nzk+1 = zk + \u03b8D \u22121(Cxk+1 \u2212Dzk \u2212 h).\n4: end for\n3. Convergence analysis for GSOR. First, the following two lemmas give readily verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for all roots of a real polynomial of degree two or three, respectively, to have modulus less than one.\nLemma 3.1. [11, Theorem 1.3] Consider the second-degree polynomial equation\n(3.1) \u03bb2 + a1\u03bb+ a0 = 0,\nwhere a0 and a1 are real numbers. A necessary and sufficient condition for both roots of (3.1) to lie in the open disk |\u03bb| < 1 is\n|a1| < 1 + a0 < 2.\nLemma 3.2. [11, Theorem 1.4] Consider the third-degree polynomial equation\n(3.2) \u03bb3 + a2\u03bb 2 + a1\u03bb+ a0 = 0,\nwhere a0, a1, and a2 are real numbers. A necessary and sufficient condition for all roots of (3.2) to lie in the open disk |\u03bb| < 1 is\n|a2 + a0| < 1 + a1, |a2 \u2212 3a0| < 3\u2212 a1, a20 + a1 \u2212 a0a2 < 1.\nGSOR is convergent if and only if the spectral radius of T is less than 1; i.e., \u03c1(T ) = \u03c1((D \u2212 \u2126L)\u22121[(I \u2212 \u2126)D + \u2126U ]) < 1. From this point of view, we can now study the convergence properties of GSOR.\nTheorem 3.1. Assume that A and D are SPD, and that B has full row rank. Let the maximum eigenvalues of A\u22121BTP\u22121B and A\u22121CTD\u22121C be \u00b5max and \u03bdmax, respectively.

Let \u03bb and v = (x, y, z) be an eigenvalue and eigenvector of T . Then\n[(I \u2212 \u2126)D +\u2126U ]v = \u03bb(D \u2212 \u2126L)v.\nSubstituting (2.4) and (2.5) gives\n(1\u2212 \u03c9)Ax\u2212 \u03c9BTy \u2212 \u03c9CTz = \u03bbAx,(3.3) Py = \u2212\u03bb\u03c4Bx + \u03bbPy,(3.4) (1\u2212 \u03b8)Dz = \u2212\u03bb\u03b8Cx+ \u03bbDz.(3.5)\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\nTo continue the proof, we consider sufficient conditions to guarantee |\u03bb| < 1. If \u03bb = 1\u2212 \u03b8, we have |\u03bb| < 1 if and only if 0 < \u03b8 < 2. In the following, we assume that \u03bb 6= 1\u2212 \u03b8 and 0 < \u03b8 < 2. Note that we must have \u03bb 6= 1; otherwise, (3.3)\u2013(3.5) give\nAx+BTy + CTz = 0, Bx = 0, Dz = Cx,(3.6)\nwhich imply that 0 = xTAx + xTBTy + xTCTz = xTAx + zTDz. Given that both A and D are SPD, we have xTAx = 0 and zTDz = 0, which further means x = 0 and z = 0. With B having full row rank, the first equality in (3.6) gives y = 0. This contradicts the fact that v is an eigenvector.\nIt follows from \u03bb 6= 1, \u03bb 6= 1\u2212 \u03b8, and (3.4)\u2013(3.5) that\ny = \u03bb\u03c4\n\u03bb\u2212 1P \u22121Bx, z =\n\u03bb\u03b8\n\u03bb+ \u03b8 \u2212 1D \u22121Cx.\nSubstituting these into (3.3), we obtain\n(1\u2212 \u03c9)Ax\u2212 \u03bb\u03c9\u03c4 \u03bb\u2212 1B TP\u22121Bx\u2212 \u03bb\u03c9\u03b8 \u03bb+ \u03b8 \u2212 1C TD\u22121Cx = \u03bbAx.\nNote that x 6= 0; otherwise, we have Py = 0 and Dz = 0, which implies v = 0 because P and D are SPD. This contradicts the fact that v is an eigenvector. Therefore, premultiplying both sides by x\u2217/(x\u2217Ax) gives\n(3.7) 1\u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c9\u03c4 \u03bb\u2212 1\u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03bb\u03c9\u03b8 \u03bb+ \u03b8 \u2212 1\u03d5(x) = \u03bb,\nwhere\n\u03c6(x) = x\u2217BTP\u22121Bx\nx\u2217Ax , \u03d5(x) =\nx\u2217CTD\u22121Cx\nx\u2217Ax .\nFirst, we consider the case x \u2208 null(B). Clearly, \u03c6(x) = 0. If x \u2208 null(C) as well, it follows from (3.7) that \u03bb = 1 \u2212 \u03c9. To guarantee |\u03bb| < 1, we can assume that 0 < \u03c9 < 2. If x /\u2208 null(C), with \u03c6(x) = 0, (3.7) reduces to the quadratic polynomial equation \u03bb2 + (\u03c9 + \u03b8 + \u03c9\u03b8\u03d5(x) \u2212 2)\u03bb+ 1 + \u03c9\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b8 = 0. By Lemma 3.1, both roots \u03bb of this real quadratic equation satisfy |\u03bb| < 1 if and only if |\u03c9 + \u03b8 + \u03c9\u03b8\u03d5(x) \u2212 2| < 2 + \u03c9\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b8 < 2. If 0 < \u03c9 < 2 and 0 < \u03b8 < 2, we have \u03c9 + \u03b8 \u2265 2 \u221a \u03c9\u03b8 > \u03c9\u03b8 \u21d2 \u03c9 + \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8 > 0. This, along with \u03d5(x) \u2265 0 yields\n0 < \u03c9 < 2(2\u2212 \u03b8)\n2\u2212 \u03b8 + \u03b8\u03d5(x) \u2264 2 .(3.8)\nNext, we consider the case x /\u2208 null(B). Then \u03c6(x) > 0 and (3.7) can be rewritten as a cubic polynomial equation \u03bb3 + a2\u03bb 2 + a1\u03bb+ a0 = 0, where\na2 = \u03b8 + \u03c9 + \u03c9\u03c4\u03c6(x) + \u03c9\u03b8\u03d5(x)\u2212 3, a1 = 3+ \u03c9\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03c9 \u2212 2\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9\u03c4(1\u2212 \u03b8)\u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8\u03d5(x), a0 = \u03c9 + \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8 \u2212 1.\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\nBy Lemma 3.2, all roots \u03bb of the above real cubic equation satisfy |\u03bb| < 1 if and only if\n\u2223 \u2223 2\u03c9 + 2\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8 + \u03c9\u03c4\u03c6(x) + \u03c9\u03b8\u03d5(x)\u2212 4 \u2223\n\u2223 < 4 + \u03c9\u03b8 \u2212 2\u03c9 \u2212 2\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9\u03c4 (1\u2212 \u03b8)\u03c6(x)\u2212 \u03c9\u03b8\u03d5(x),(3.9) \u2223\n\u2223\u03c9\u03c4\u03c6(x) + \u03c9\u03b8\u03d5(x)\u2212 2\u03c9 \u2212 2\u03b8 + 3\u03c9\u03b8 \u2223 \u2223 < 2\u03c9 + 2\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8 + \u03c9\u03c4 (1\u2212 \u03b8)\u03c6(x) + \u03c9\u03b8\u03d5(x),(3.10)\n\u03b8(\u03c9\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03b8) (1 + \u03d5(x))\u2212 \u03c9\u03c4 (1\u2212 \u03b8)\u03c6(x) < 0.(3.11)\nNote that with \u03c6(x) > 0, \u03d5(x) \u2265 0, and 0 < \u03b8 < 2, (3.9) leads to \u03c4 > 0 and\n(3.12) 0 < \u03c9 < 4(2\u2212 \u03b8)\n4\u2212 2\u03b8 + \u03c4(2 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03c6(x) + 2\u03b8\u03d5(x) \u2264 2.\nIt follows from (3.10) that\n(3.13) \u03c9\u03c4\u03b8\u03c6(x) < 4(\u03c9 + \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8),\nand\n(3.14) \u03c9\u03c4(2 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03c6(x) + 2\u03c9\u03b8\u03d5(x) + 2\u03c9\u03b8 > 0.\nIf \u03c9 > 0, \u03c4 > 0 and 0 < \u03b8 < 2, as \u03c6(x) > 0 and \u03d5(x) \u2265 0, clearly (3.14) holds. This together with (3.13) implies that (3.10) holds if\n0 < \u03c4 < 4(\u03c9 + \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8)\n\u03c9\u03b8\u03c6(x) .(3.15)\nInequality (3.11) holds if 0 < \u03b8 \u2264 1 because \u03c9, \u03c4 > 0.

Combining with (3.16)\u2013(3.18) completes the proof.\nRemark 3.2. We emphasize that parameters \u03c9, \u03c4 and \u03b8 can be chosen to satisfy the conditions derived in Theorem 3.1. Indeed, as 0 < \u03c9 < 2 and 0 < \u03b8 < 2, we get\n4(\u03c9 + \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b8) \u03c9\u03b8\u00b5max = 4 \u03b8\u00b5max\n( 1 + \u03b8\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b8\n) > 4\n\u03b8\u00b5max\n( 1 + \u03b8\n2 \u2212 \u03b8\n) =\n2(2\u2212 \u03b8) \u03b8\u00b5max .\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\nThus, we can first choose \u03b8 satisfying 0 < \u03b8 < 2, and then choose \u03c4 in the open interval ( 0, 2(2\u2212\u03b8)\u03b8\u00b5max ) . Finally, we choose \u03c9 satisfying\n0 < \u03c9 < 4(2\u2212 \u03b8)\n(2 \u2212 \u03b8)(2 + \u03c4\u00b5max) + 2\u03b8\u03bdmax .\nRemark 3.3. If \u03c9 = 1, (3.7) can be simplified as\n\u03bb2 + (\u03b8 \u2212 2 + \u03c4\u03c6(x) + \u03b8\u03d5(x))\u03bb + 1\u2212 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c4\u03c6(x) + \u03c4\u03b8\u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03b8\u03d5(x) = 0.\nIt follows from Lemma 3.1 that |\u03bb| < 1 holds if and only if\n|\u03b8 \u2212 2 + \u03c4\u03c6(x) + \u03b8\u03d5(x)| < 2\u2212 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03c4\u03c6(x) + \u03c4\u03b8\u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03b8\u03d5(x) < 2.\nAfter some algebra, we see that GSOR with \u03c9 = 1 is convergent if\n0 < \u03b8 < 2\n1 + \u03bdmax , 0 < \u03c4 < 2(2\u2212 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u03bdmax) (2 \u2212 \u03b8)\u00b5max .\nRemark 3.4. If \u03c9 = 1 and \u03b8 = 1, GSOR is the same as the Uzawa-like method studied in [4, section 2.2]. In this case, (3.7) reduces to\n\u03bb2 + (\u03c4\u03c6(x) + \u03d5(x) \u2212 1)\u03bb\u2212 \u03d5(x) = 0.\nBy Lemma 3.1, we know that |\u03bb| < 1 holds if and only if \u2223\u2223\u03c4\u03c6(x) + \u03d5(x)\u2212 1 \u2223\u2223 < 1\u2212 \u03d5(x) < 2.\nThis implies that, for any \u03c4 , GSOR diverges when \u03bdmax \u2265 1. Therefore, for this special case, GSOR is convergent provided\n\u03bdmax < 1, 0 < \u03c4 < 2(1\u2212 \u03bdmax)\n\u00b5max .\nThis result is the same as [4, Theorem 3], which is the convergence theorem of the Uzawa-like method. However, we emphasize that the condition \u03bdmax < 1 is strong. In fact, as shown in section 5.2 below, the saddle-point problems from the mixed Stokes-Darcy model in porous media applications do not satisfy this condition. With Remark 3.3, this shows that it is necessary to introduce another parameter.\n4. The GSOR preconditioner. We develop and analyze a class of block lower triangular preconditioners to accelerate Krylov methods for (1.1).\nThe splitting in (2.6) can induce a preconditioner M for (1.1). The corresponding preconditioned matrix M\u22121A has the form\n \n\u03c9I \u03c9A\u22121BT \u03c9A\u22121CT\n(\u03c9 \u2212 1)\u03c4P\u22121B \u03c9\u03c4P\u22121BA\u22121BT \u03c9\u03c4P\u22121BA\u22121CT (\u03c9 \u2212 1)\u03b8D\u22121C \u03c9\u03b8D\u22121CA\u22121BT \u03b8I + \u03c9\u03b8D\u22121CA\u22121CT\n  .\nWhen \u03c9 = 1, M\u22121A has at least n eigenvalues equal to 1. As clustered eigenvalues are desirable, we consider the block lower triangular preconditioner\nP =   A 0 0 B \u2212 1\u03c4 P 0 C 0 \u2212 1\u03b8D   . Cahier du GERAD G-2022-35\nWhen P is used to precondition Krylov subspace methods, each step needs to solve three linear systems involving A, P , and D. This is more practical than the block preconditioners of [3, 2] and the (relaxed) APSS preconditioners of [16], which need to solve several dense linear systems involving matrices like BA\u22121BT, D+CA\u22121CT , A+BTB/\u03b1, and D + CCT /\u03b1, where \u03b1 is a positive number.\nTo illustrate further the efficiency of our preconditioner P , we derive explicit and sharp bounds on the spectrum of the preconditioned matrix P\u22121A. By direct calculations, we have\nP\u22121A =\n  I A\u22121BT A\u22121CT\n0 \u03c4P\u22121BA\u22121BT \u03c4P\u22121BA\u22121CT 0 \u03b8D\u22121CA\u22121BT \u03b8I + \u03b8D\u22121CA\u22121CT\n  ,\nwhich is similar to   I B\u0302T C\u0302T\n0 \u03c4B\u0302B\u0302T \u03c4B\u0302C\u0302T 0 \u03b8C\u0302B\u0302T \u03b8I + \u03b8C\u0302C\u0302T\n  ,\nwhere B\u0302 = P\u22121/2BA\u22121/2 and C\u0302 = D\u22121/2CA\u22121/2. Thus P\u22121A has eigenvalue 1 with multiplicity n, and the remaining eigenvalues are the same as those of\nK =\n( \u03c4B\u0302B\u0302T \u03c4B\u0302C\u0302T\n\u03b8C\u0302B\u0302T \u03b8I + \u03b8C\u0302C\u0302T\n) .\nWe can now establish the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.1. Assume that A and D are SPD, and B has full row rank. Let the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of P\u22121BA\u22121BT be \u00b5min and \u00b5max. Let the maximum eigenvalue of D\u22121CA\u22121CT be \u03bdmax. Then P\u22121A has eigenvalue 1 with multiplicity at least n, and the remaining eigenvalues lie in the interval\n  \u039b\u2212 \u221a \u039b2 \u2212 4\u03c4\u03b8\u00b5min\n2 , \u039b + \u221a \u039b 2 \u2212 4\u03c4\u03b8\u00b5max 2   ,\nwhere\n\u039b = \u03b8(1 + \u03bdmax) + \u03c4\u00b5min, \u039b = \u03b8(1 + \u03bdmax) + \u03c4\u00b5max.(4.1)\nProof. We need to estimate spectral bounds for K. Let \u03bb be an eigenvalue of K and (yT, zT)T be a corresponding eigenvector. With \u03c4 > 0 and \u03b8 > 0 we see that K is similar to a symmetric matrix, and hence \u03bb is real. Also,\n\u03c4B\u0302B\u0302Ty + \u03c4B\u0302C\u0302Tz = \u03bby,(4.2)\n\u03b8C\u0302B\u0302Ty + \u03b8z + \u03b8C\u0302C\u0302Tz = \u03bbz.(4.3)\nWe obtain estimates of \u03bb by considering two cases separately. Case I: z \u2208 null(C\u0302T ). Clearly, \u03c4B\u0302B\u0302Ty = \u03bby and \u03b8C\u0302B\u0302Ty = (\u03bb\u2212 \u03b8)z. This implies that \u03bb = \u03b8 or \u03bb is an eigenvalue of B\u0302B\u0302T. Note that B\u0302B\u0302T = P\u22121/2BA\u22121BTP\u22121/2 is similar to P\u22121BA\u22121BT, so that \u03bb = \u03b8 or \u03c4\u00b5min \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 \u03c4\u00b5max.\nCase II: z /\u2208 null(C\u0302T ). We only consider the case \u03bb /\u2208 [\u03c4\u00b5min, \u03c4\u00b5max], so that \u03bbI \u2212 \u03c4B\u0302B\u0302T is nonsingular. With (4.2), this leads to y = \u03c4(\u03bbI \u2212 \u03c4B\u0302B\u0302T )\u22121B\u0302C\u0302Tz.

Theorem 4.1 shows that the preconditioned matrices P\u22121A = P\u0302\u22121A\u0302 are positive stable.

As shown in section 5 below, \u03bdmax of the saddle-point systems from the liquid crystal directors model and the mixed Stokes-Darcy model in porous media applications is 0.1750 and 1.0057, respectively.\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\n5. Numerical experiments. We present the results of numerical tests to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of GSOR. All experiments were run using MATLAB R2015b on a PC with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.8GHz and 16GB of RAM. The initial guess is taken to be the zero vector, and the algorithms are terminated when the number of iterations exceeds 105 or\nRes := \u2016b\u2212Awk\u20162/\u2016b\u2016 \u2264 10\u22128,\nwhere wk is the current approximate solution. We report the number of iterations, the CPU time, and the final value of the relative residual, denoted by \u201cIter\u201d, \u201cCPU\u201d and \u201cRes\u201d, respectively.\nFor our GSOR method, we tried just a few values of the parameters \u03c9, \u03c4 and \u03b8. We compared our method with the Uzawa-like method (denoted \u201cUzawa\u201d) and the generalization of the block SOR method (denoted \u201cGBSOR\u201d) studied in [4, Section 2.2 and Section 3], respectively. We emphasize that the Uzawa method is a special case of our GSOR method with P = Q, \u03c9 = 1, and \u03b8 = 1. For GBSOR, based on [4, Theorem 5], we chose \u03c9 = s/4, s/2, 3s/4 (denoted \u201cGBSORa\u201d, \u201cGBSORb\u201d, \u201cGBSORc\u201d, respectively), where s = 2/(1+ \u221a \u03bdmax) is the upper bound of the convergence interval for the parameter \u03c9. We used the function \u201ceigs\u201d to compute \u03bdmax. We also tested Krylov methods for (1.1) or (2.1), such as MINRES, GMRES, and BICGSTAB. For preconditioned MINRES (denoted \u201cBPMINRES\u201d), we use the block diagonal preconditioner\n  A 0 0 0 BA\u22121BT 0 0 0 D + CA\u22121CT   .\nFor D = 0, this block diagonal preconditioner has been studied in [3]. For preconditioned GMRES, we test the GSOR preconditioner P with \u03c4 = \u03b8 = 1 (denoted \u201cGPGMRES\u201d) and the block triangular preconditioner [3] (denoted \u201cBPGMRES\u201d)\n  A BT CT\n0 \u2212BA\u22121BT 0 0 0 \u2212(D + CA\u22121CT)\n  .\n5.1. Saddle-point systems from the liquid crystal directors model. Continuum models for the orientational properties of liquid crystals require minimization of free energy functionals of the form\n(5.1) F [u, v, w, U ] = 1 2\n\u222b 1\n0\n[(u2z + v 2 z + w 2 z)\u2212 \u03b72(\u03b2 + w2)U2z ]dz,\nwhere u, v, w, and U are functions of z \u2208 [0, 1] subject to suitable end-point conditions, uz, vz, wz, and Uz denote the first derivatives of the corresponding functions with respect to z, and \u03b7 and \u03b2 are prescribed positive parameters. By discretizing with a uniform piecewise-linear finite element scheme with N + 1 cells using nodal quadrature and the prescribed boundary conditions, we minimize the free energy (5.1) under the unit vector constraint. We apply the Lagrange multiplier method to solve this discretized minimization model, and Newton\u2019s method to solve the nonlinear equations from the first-order conditions of the Lagrangian. Each step involves the solution of a linear system of the form (1.1) with n = 3N and m = p = N . For more details, we refer to [17].\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\nIn our numerical experiments we set \u03b7 = \u221a 3\u03c0/4 and \u03b2 = 0.5, which is known as the critical switching value. The discretized matrix A is tridiagonal, so in all algorithms we solve systems Ax = r directly by the function \u201c\\\u201d, which uses a tridiagonal solver. We set P = BA\u22121BT and solve systems Py = r using Cholesky factorization. Numerical results are listed in Tables 1 and 2 with N = 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, 16383, where the parameter choices for GSOR and the corresponding notation are as follows:\nMethod GSORa GSORb GSORc GSORd (\u03c9, \u03c4, \u03b8) (1, 1, 1) (0.95, 0.95, 0.95) (0.9, 0.8, 1) (0.95, 1, 0.95)\nFor this problem, A\u2212CTD\u22121C is SPD, which guarantees convergence of the Uzawalike method [4, Theorem 3]. We set Q = BA\u22121BT and \u03b1 = 1 \u2212 \u03bdmax, where \u03bdmax = 0.1750 is the maximum eigenvalue of A\n\u22121CTD\u22121C. MINRES, GMRES and BICGSTAB without preconditioning failed to solve this problem. (For GMRES, we set the restart frequency to 100.) BICGSTAB hit an error condition. Therefore in Table 2 we only report results from preconditioned MINRES and preconditioned GMRES.\nTo see the role of the parameters in the convergence behavior of GSOR, Figure 1 shows the region of the parameters where GSOR satisfies Res \u2264 10\u22128 within 5, 000 iterations, and the characteristic curves of the number of iterations versus the parameters for N = 1, 023. In Figure 2, we plot the eigenvalue distributions of the original matrix and the GSOR preconditioned matrix P\u22121A with different \u03c4 and \u03c9.\n5.2. Saddle-point systems from the mixed Stokes-Darcy model in porous media applications. Fluid flow in \u2126f \u2282 R2 coupled with porous media flow in \u2126p \u2282 R2 is governed by the static Stokes equations\n(5.2) \u2212 \u03c5\u2206uf +\u2207 pf = f , and divuf = 0, x \u2208 \u2126f ,\nwhere \u2126f \u2229\u2126p = \u2205 and \u2126f \u2229\u2126p = \u0393 with \u0393 being an interface, \u03c5 > 0 is the kinematic viscosity, and f is the external force.\nIn the porous media region, the governing variable is \u03c6 = pp \u03c1fg , where pp is the pressure in \u2126p, \u03c1f is the fluid density, and g is the gravity acceleration. The velocity up of the porous media flow is related to \u03c6 by Darcy\u2019s law and is also divergence free:\n(5.3) up = \u2212 \u01eb2\nr\u03c5 \u2207\u03c6 and \u2212 divup = 0, x \u2208 \u2126p,\nwhere r is the volumetric porosity, and \u01eb the characteristic length of the porous media. Applying finite element discretization to the mixed Stokes-Darcy model (5.2)\u2013 (5.3) with the Dirichlet boundary conditions leads to linear systems of form (1.1) [6]. In our numerical experiments, we set \u03c5 = 1, r = 1, and \u01eb = \u221a 0.1. The computational domain is \u2126f = (0, 1) \u00d7 (1, 2), \u2126p = (0, 1) \u00d7 (0, 1) and the interface is \u0393 = (0, 1)\u00d7{1}. We use a uniform mesh with grid parameters h = 2\u22123, 2\u22124, 2\u22125, 2\u22126\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\nto decompose \u2126f , P2\u2013P1 elements in the fluid region, and P2 Lagrange elements in the porous media region.\nFor this problem, P is the pressure mass matrix discretized from the decoupled problem of (5.2)\u2013(5.3) [6]. In all algorithms we use Cholesky factorization to solve the systems Ax = r, Py = r and BA\u22121BTy = r. Numerical results for saddle-point systems from the mixed Stokes-Darcy model (5.2)\u2013(5.3) are listed in Tables 3 and 4, where the parameters choices for GSOR and the corresponding notation are as follows.\nMethod GSORa GSORb GSORc GSORd (\u03c9, \u03c4, \u03b8) (0.5, 1.5, 1.0) (0.5, 1.7, 0.8) (0.5, 1.6, 1.2) (0.6, 1.5, 1.0)\nFor this problem, \u03bdmax = 1.0057. The matrix A \u2212 CTD\u22121C is no longer SPD, so convergence of the Uzawa-like method cannot be guaranteed [4, Theorem 3]. We tested several \u03b1 ranging from 0.005 to 0.5 for h = 2\u22123. Uzawa failed in all cases. Thus, we do not report results for Uzawa in Table 4. As MINRES and GMRES worked only for systems with h \u2265 2\u22125, we again do not report their results.\nTo see the role of the parameters in the convergence behavior of GSOR, Figure 3 shows the region of parameters for which GSOR satisfies Res \u2264 10\u22128 within 5, 000 steps, and the characteristic curves of iteration numbers versus parameters for h = 2\u22123. In Figure 4, we plot the eigenvalue distributions of the original matrix and the GSOR preconditioned matrix P\u22121A with different \u03c4 and \u03c9.\nTables 1 to 4 and Figures 1 to 4 illustrate that GSOR is a practical method, and its advantages increase with the problem size. We see from Tables 1 to 4 that BPMINRES and BPGMRES are not practical in terms of CPU times. Figures 1 and 3 indicate that the convergence rate of GSOR depends strongly on \u03c9, \u03c4 and \u03b8. Figures 2\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\nand 4 show that P greatly improves the eigenvalue distribution of the original A. 6. Conclusions. We presented a theoretical and numerical study of the GSOR method for solving the double saddle-point problem (1.1). GSOR is convergent with suitable parameters \u03c9, \u03c4 , and \u03b8. Unlike existing work, our proof is based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for all roots of a real cubic polynomial to have modulus less than one. We analyzed a class of block lower triangular preconditioners P induced from GSOR and derived explicit and sharp bounds for the eigenvalues of preconditioned matrices. The numerical results presented are highly encouraging. GSOR requires the least CPU time, and especially for larger problems, its advantages are clear. A shortcoming is the need to choose the three parameters. A practical method to choose them is a topic for future research.\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\nCahier du GERAD G-2022-35\nAcknowledgments.
