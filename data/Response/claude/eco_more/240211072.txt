 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the effect of different types of temptations (e.g. money, food, entertainment) on awareness of self-control problems and demand for commitment devices. The paper used food temptation, but other temptations may produce different results.

2. Investigate the relationship between individual characteristics (e.g. age, gender, personality traits) and degree of sophistication/awareness of self-control problems. The paper did not analyze this, but individual differences could impact the findings. 

3. Develop methods to quantify the implicit welfare loss (Vf) from losing flexibility when committing to an option. The paper noted the complexity of measuring Vf but estimating it could improve the model.

4. Test the model in real-world settings like health behaviors (diet, exercise) or finances (saving, spending) to see its applicability beyond experimental conditions. The paper was limited to a lab experiment.

5. Explore policy implications, such as how insights on partial naivete and demand for commitment could inform the design of programs and incentives to help people address self-control problems. The paper suggested policy relevance but did not provide analysis.
