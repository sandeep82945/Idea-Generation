Limited prospective data exist on real-world performance of pulse oximeters in critically ill patients. The objective of this study was to assess accuracy and bias of the SpO2 values measured by several oximeters in hospitalized subjects. METHODS: We included stable adults in the ICU with an arterial catheter in place. Main exclusion criteria were poor SpO2 signal and SpO2 > 96%. In each subject, we simultaneously evaluated 4 oximeters: Nonin (Plymouth, Minnesota) embedded in the FreeO2 device (OxyNov, Qu\u00e9bec City, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada), Masimo (Radical-7, Masimo, Irvine, California), Philips (FAST, Philips, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and Nellcor (N-600, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota). Arterial blood gases were drawn and simultaneously each oximeters\u2019 SpO2 values were collected. SpO2 values were compared to the reference (arterial oxygen saturation [SaO2] value) to determine bias and accuracy. The ability for oximeters to detect hypoxemia and the impact of oximeters on oxygen titration were evaluated. RESULTS: We included 193 subjects (153 male, mean age 66 y) in whom 211 sets of measurements were performed. The skin pigmentation evaluated by Fitzpatrick scale showed 96.2% of subjects were light skin (types 1 and 2). One oximeter overestimated SaO2 (Philips, +0.9%), whereas the 3 others underestimated SaO2 (Nonin 23.1%, Nellcor 20.3%, Masimo 20.2%). SaO2 was underestimated with Nonin oximeter in 91.3% of the cases, whereas it was overestimated in 55.2% of the cases with Philips oximeter. Moderate hypoxemia (SaO2 86\u201390% or PaO2 55\u201360 mm Hg) was detected in 92, 33, 42, and 11% of the cases with Nonin, Nellcor, Masimo, and Philips, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant bias and moderate accuracy between the tested oximeters and the arterial blood gases in the studied population. These discrepancies may have important clinical impact on the detection of hypoxemia and management of oxygen therapy.",

Limited prospective data exist on real-world performance of pulse oximeters in critically ill patients. The objective of this study was to assess accuracy and bias of the SpO2 values measured by several oximeters in hospitalized subjects. METHODS: We included stable adults in the ICU with an arterial catheter in place. Main exclusion criteria were poor SpO2 signal and SpO2 > 96%. In each subject, we simultaneously evaluated 4 oximeters: Nonin (Plymouth, Minnesota) embedded in the FreeO2 device (OxyNov, Que\u0301bec City, Que\u0301bec, Canada), Masimo (Radical-7, Masimo, Irvine, California), Philips (FAST, Philips, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and Nellcor (N-600, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota). Arterial blood gases were drawn and simultaneously each oximeters\u2019 SpO2 values were collected. SpO2 values were compared to the reference (arterial oxygen saturation [SaO2] value) to determine bias and accuracy. The ability for oximeters to detect hypoxemia and the impact of oximeters on oxygen titration were evaluated. RESULTS: We included 193 subjects (153 male, mean age 66 y) in whom 211 sets of measurements were performed. The skin pigmentation evaluated by Fitzpatrick scale showed 96.2% of subjects were light skin (types 1 and 2). One oximeter overestimated SaO2 (Philips, +0.9%), whereas the 3 others underestimated SaO2 (Nonin 23.1%, Nellcor 20.3%, Masimo 20.2%). SaO2 was underestimated with Nonin oximeter in 91.3% of the cases, whereas it was overestimated in 55.2% of the cases with Philips oximeter. Moderate hypoxemia (SaO2 86\u201390% or PaO2 55\u201360 mm Hg) was detected in 92, 33, 42, and 11% of the cases with Nonin, Nellcor, Masimo, and Philips, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant bias and moderate accuracy between the tested oximeters and the arterial blood gases in the studied population. These discrepancies may have important clinical impact on the detection of hypoxemia and management of oxygen therapy.

It has been shown that small variations in SpO2 target greatly affect the oxygen flow required, which may have a relevant impact on clinical decisions.16-19 Furthermore, SpO2 is frequently\nused to detect hypoxemia and assess the severity of patients with pneumonia. SpO2 and oxygen support also have an impact on clinical decision-making such as the initiation of corticosteroid treatment, intubation, or transfer to an ICU. For all these reasons, pulse oximeter accuracy is desirable. Although modern pulse oximetry was described 50 years ago, basics of this technology have not evolved significantly. Main evaluations of accuracy of these devices are carried out in healthy volunteers, with the exception of a few studies conducted in subjects.20-24 For certification purpose, studies are conducted in healthy subjects,25 whereas a number of common clinical conditions encountered in patients can reduce pulse oximetry accuracy. The conditions that may alter oximeters\u2019 precision include skin pigmentation,20,26-30 skin temperature, skin thickness, nail polish, movement artifacts,20,21,31-33 and poor peripheral\nRESPIRATORY CARE MAY 2023 VOL 68 NO 5 565\nperfusion.34,35 The impact of the oximeter brand used on measurement accuracy has been poorly evaluated in subjects with currently available devices.21,22,26,27,31,36\nNo recent study has simultaneously compared SpO2 values from multiple oximeters to the reference standard SaO2. As a\nresult, the assessment of agreement between SpO2 and SaO2 with currently available oximeters is required. The objective of this study was to describe the accuracy and bias of the SpO2 value measured by several oximeters (Nonin, Nellcor, Masimo, and Philips) frequently used in clinical practice compared to the reference value, SaO2, measured by arterial blood gases in stable subjects admitted in an ICU."

The study was approved by the IUCPQ Research Ethics Committee with a waiver of consent.\nTo be eligible, adult subjects (age $ 18 y) were to be stable in terms of oxygen administration parameters (no change in FIO2 and O2 flow for the last 30 min) and hospitalized in the ICU with an arterial catheter in place. Exclusion criteria were instability requiring frequent ventilator parameter modifications, poor SpO2 signal (based on the pulse oximetry\nwaveform), recent ICU admission (considered unstable), infectious isolation, SpO2 > 96%, methemoglobinemia > 1.5%, and presence of dark nail polish.33 Subjects could not be studied more than once per day.\nThe evaluated oximeters were Nonin (Plymouth, Minne-\nsota) embedded in the FreeO2 device (OxyNov, Que\u0301bec City, Que\u0301bec, Canada), Masimo (non\u2013touch screen Radical-\n7, Masimo, Irvine, California), Philips (FAST, Amsterdam,\nthe Netherlands), and Nellcor (N-600, Medtronic, Minne-\napolis, Minnesota). The slowest moving average time for\nSpO2 display was set on each of the oximeters (Nonin, 4 beats; Nellcor, 5\u20137 s; Masimo, 4 s; Philips, 5 s). Reusable\ndigital sensors for all oximeters were used.\nBefore scheduled arterial blood gases, the oximeter sensors were placed on fingers in random order.32 The fingers were randomized for the 4 tested oximeters (Nonin, Nellcor, Masimo, and Philips). The fingers used were the index, middle, and ring fingers of each hand.\nOnce all oximeters were in place, 2 min passed before the measurements were taken to ensure stability of the values. We used the pulse oximetry waveform to determine a signal quality for all oximeters. Four different technicians evaluated the pulse oximetry waveform for the included subjects. They all required mutual agreement on the quality of waveform. Then, each oximeter\u2019s SpO2 values were collected simultaneously to the arterial blood gas. SaO2 was used as the reference standard since it is commonly used as the reference in multiple previous studies (functional saturation was reported as recommended).20-24 It was determined by multiwavelength oximetry (ABL800 FLEX, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark).\nQUICK LOOK\nCurrent knowledge\nAn accurate SpO2 value is critical in order to optimally titrate oxygen delivery to patients and to follow oxygenation guidelines. Oximeters\u2019 accuracy has not been well evaluated in subjects, although real-life conditions may reduce pulse oximetry accuracy in comparison with evaluations conducted in healthy volunteers with hands wrapped in a warming pad.\nWhat this paper contributes to our knowledge\nThe present study shows that bias and accuracy of oximeters were variable in these medical instruments. We found significant bias and moderate accuracy between the tested oximeters and the arterial blood gases in the studied population. Oximeters are not all similar and provide different information. These discrepancies may have important impact on management of oxygen therapy and on clinical decision-making related to oxygenation.\nDrs Blanchet, Delobel, Nayet, Bouchard, and Lellouche and Dr Mercier and Mr Simard are affiliated with Department of Medicine, Centre de recherche, Institut Universitaire de Cardiologie et de Pneumologie de Que\u0301bec, Universite\u0301 Laval, Que\u0301bec, Canada.

At a global significance level of 5% and applying the Bonferroni criteria for multiple comparisons, 210 records were required to detect a mean difference of 0.5% using a power of 95%. Using 35 randomization blocks, 210 participants could be enrolled. Continuous variables are reported as mean6 SD or median with interquartile range as appropriate. Nominal variables are reported as frequencies. The primary outcome evaluates the accuracy (random error) and bias (systematic error) of the SpO2 value measured by different oximeters frequently used in the clinical practice compared to the reference value of SaO2 measured by arterial gases in subjects managed in the ICU. The first approach was the use of Bland-Altman plot to analyze the agreement between values of SaO2 measured by arterial gases and values of SpO2 measured by oximeters. We reported mean bias, precision, and 95% CI. Mean bias was calculated as SpO2 SaO2 from each oximeter\u2019s value and the corresponding arterial blood value. Precision was calculated as SD of the bias. We reported root mean square error (RMSE), a parameter required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for pulse oximeters\u2019 certification. RMSE is derived from calculations involving bias and precision.\nIntra-class correlations were reported for assessing agreement between the reference values for SaO2 and pulse oximetry values from oximeters separately. Relationships between the reference values for SaO2 and pulse oximetry values from oximeters were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient. The linear mixed model was performed on a Latin-square design using an unrestricted covariance structure to compare oximeters (fixed factor). Blocks were linked to the random effect. The normality assumption was verified with the Shapiro-Wilk tests using residuals from the statistical model and transformed by the Cholesky\nmetric. The Brown and Forsythe variation of Levene test statistic was used to verify the homogeneity of variances. Test was performed at 5% level.\nFactors that modified the SpO2 SaO2 gap for each tested oximeter were analyzed using a linear regression model. Multivariable linear regressions were performed to determine independent predictors. Continuous variables were checked for the assumption of linearity. The final model was selected on the smallest Akaike criteria. The statistical analysis was not planned for multiplicity in test for secondary outcomes. All reports estimates are expressed using mean and 95% CI. Some baseline characteristics were used to investigate if any may explain the variability among oximeters by adding interaction terms between oximeters and variables. The hypoxemia detection was analyzed for each oximeter. The areas under the curve were compared using univariable models. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) and R package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)."

Subjects could only be included once a day in the study. The mean age was 66 6 11 y. The skin pigmentation, using the Fitzpatrick scale, was of type 1 or 2 in 96.2% of subjects. Sixty-four subjects had diabetes; 32 had peripheral vascular disease; 24 had left heart failure; 60 subjects received vasopressors or inotropes at time of measurement; 22 subjects received invasive ventilation (mean FIO2 was 0.37 6 0.09); 15 received high-flow oxygen therapy; 3 received noninvasive ventilation; 87 received conventional oxygen therapy (mean O2 flow was 2.9 6 4.8 L/min), and 83 did not have respiratory support (Table 1 and study flow chart Figure S1, see related supplementary materials at http://www.rcjournal.com). Thirty-one subjects had tachycardia (heart rate > 100 beats/min); 15 were hypotensive (systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg), and none were hypothermic (core temperature< 35 C). Mean SaO2 value was 93.6 6 2.2%. There was positive bias of +0.9% for the Philips oximeter. There was negative bias for the oximeters Nonin, Nellcor, and Masimo, with bias of 3.1, 0.3, and 0.2%, respectively (Table 2). A BlandAltman plot was drawn for each oximeter to illustrate agreement between SpO2 and SaO2. Mean bias6 precision and 95% CI were 3.1 6 2.1 ( 7.2 to 11.0) for Nonin, 0.3 6 1.7 ( 3.6 to 3.1) for Nellcor, 0.2 6 1.9 ( 4.0 to 3.6) for Masimo, and 0.96 1.9 ( 2.9 to 4.7) for Philips (Fig. 1). The Nonin oximeter underestimated SaO2 in 90.3% of SpO2 values, whereas Philips overestimated SaO2 in 55% of the cases (Table 2). Overall, the frequency of differences $ plus or\nRESPIRATORY CARE MAY 2023 VOL 68 NO 5 567\nminus 4%were present in 35.2, 2.4, 8.6, and 9.5% of the pairs with Nonin, Nellcor, Masimo, and Philips, respectively.22 Bias $ plus or minus 10% was present in 1.5% of the pairs with the Nonin oximeter (Table 2). The impact of several clinical and biological parameters on the bias was assessed (peripheral arterial disease, heart failure, type of ventilation, vital signs, diabetes mellitus). There was only a minimal impact for the parameters tested. The impact of skin pigmentation could not be adequately assessed given the low number of subjects with dark-skin pigmentation (Table S1 and S2, see related supplementary materials at http://www.rcjournal. com).\nIn terms of accuracy, the tested oximeters all showed large random errors. The coefficient of determination (r2) for each oximeter expressed moderate correlation between SpO2 values and SaO2 values (Figs. 1 and S2). The Nellcor oximeter had an r2 coefficient that expressed a slightly greater accuracy than the other oximeters, with an r2 value of 0.51. The 3 other oximeters r2 coefficients were, respectively, 0.43, 0.43 and 0.44 for Nonin, Masimo, and Philips. The RMSE for each oximeter was of 3.73, 1.72, 1.95, and 2.13 for Nonin, Nellcor, Masimo, and Philips, respectively.\nOximeters frequently show diverging values for the same measurement. Nonin and Philips oximeters have shown the most significant bias, with mean bias of 4.0% (Table S3, see related supplementary materials at http:// www.rcjournal.com). Masimo and Nellcor oximeters have shown concordant results, as the mean bias between these 2 oximeters\u2019 SpO2 values was of 0.1% (Table S3). The relationship between oximeters was represented by point clouds with poor determination coefficient (r2), as shown on the Figure S5 (See related supplementary materials at http://www.rcjournal.com).\nSaO2 and PaO2 values allow detection of hypoxemia commonly defined as SaO2 < 90% and PaO2 < 60 mm Hg. 20 The ability to detect hypoxemia was variable between the tested oximeters. In the included subjects, 19 had a PaO2 value from 55\u201360 mm Hg, and 12 had an SaO2 value from 86\u2013 90%, suggesting moderate hypoxemia. The Nonin oximeter was the most sensitive of the 4 tested oximeters for detection of hypoxemia. It detected 100% of the states of\nTable 1.

            "text": "Our study showed that in our population of stable subjects hospitalized in ICUs tested pulse oximeters had moderate accuracy (random error). In addition, each oximeter had significant differences for bias (systematic error) when compared to the reference standard, SaO2. The largest bias was shown with Nonin oximeter, with a mean bias of 3.1%, followed by Philips oximeter with a mean bias of +0.9%. Masimo and Nellcor oximeters did not show a significant bias, but, as for all tested oximeters, the correlation between SpO2 and SaO2 showed a moderate accuracy. Indeed, in about 14% of the subjects, the bias between pulse oximeters saturation and SaO2 was $ 4%; and in 0.4% of the measures, the bias reached $ 10%. Large bias was more frequent with the Nonin oximeter due to its systematic negative bias. These\ncharacteristics explain the clinical impact of the tested oximeters. Nonin oximeter was able to detect 100% of hypoxemia, whereas the Philips oximeter only detected 11%. In opposition, the oxygen weaning was much more frequent with the Philips oximeter in comparison with Nonin oximeter when usual SpO2 targets were utilized. The characteristics of the oximeters should be known by the users to adequately define the SpO2 target for patients based on the oximeter used. To our knowledge, this is the most recent study that compared several oximeters to concomitant SaO2 in ICU subjects.\nThe data presented in this study revealed that oximeters had a larger bias when tested critically ill subjects rather than healthy subjects. Previous studies conducted in healthy subjects found bias of 0.21% for Nonin, and 0.27% for Nellcor, on light-skinned healthy subjects (pigmentation similar to our population).26 Another study conducted on healthy subjects found bias of about +1.0 to 1.5% for Nonin oximeter, of about 1 to +1% for Masimo, and of about 0.5% to +1% for Nellcor on light-skinned subjects.27 In the present study, Nonin oximeter bias found in subjects was much greater than those found in previous studies conducted on healthy subjects, which might in part be related to the light-skin pigmentation (> 95% of the subjects included in the study). Pulse oximetry has been shown to overestimate SaO2 in dark-skin patients. 20,36 Therefore, with the Nonin oximeter, the bias might be lower (less underestimation) on dark-skinned patients, whereas for the Philips the bias would likely be greater.36 Several other conditions that may affect arterial perfusion and oximeter accuracy were present in the subjects included in the\nTable 2.

In\naddition, studies that were carried out in healthy subjects were conducted under somewhat artificial conditions with subjects sitting still with each hand wrapped in a warming pad to ensure a good circulation to the fingers.26,27,31\n570 RESPIRATORY CARE MAY 2023 VOL 68 NO 5\nIt has been recently highlighted that the bias between SaO2 and SpO2 related to skin pigmentation is more pronounced in studies conducted in subjects compared with studies conducted in healthy volunteers.39 This is probably also true for the evaluation of oximeters, where the differences are greater in patients.\nA limited number of studies comparing several oximeters have been recently conducted in subjects.21,22,38 In those studies, none have made a systematic comparison of 4 oximeters with simultaneous arterial blood gases. A\nmulti-center study in New Zealand/Australia collected 400 pairs of SpO2 and SaO2, but only one oximeter was evaluated for each subject.22 Another study, conducted on mechanically ventilated subjects in the ICU in India, only compared 2 oximeters, Nonin and Philips.21 Results from this study slightly diverge from our results, probably as a consequence of the skin pigment of the subjects. In comparison to our data, the bias found in this study was of similar amplitude between oximeters (+2.49 6 2.99 for Philips and 0.46 6 1.68 for Nonin) but shifted by +2\u20133%. The impact of\nRESPIRATORY CARE MAY 2023 VOL 68 NO 5 571\nskin pigmentation on oximeters\u2019 bias has already been described.20,26,36 Oximeters potentially overestimate SaO2 in patients with dark-skin pigmentation, which can explain the difference in the bias found in Singh et al21 study and in our study. One recently published study evaluated oximeters\u2019 accuracy according to skin pigmentation but did not compare different oximeters and did not specify which oximeter was used.36 However, it highlighted greater overestimation of SaO2 in dark-skinned subjects. Moreover, a recent study has shown that skin pigmentation was associated with the risk of hidden hypoxemia and increased mortality.40\nOximeters characteristics, such as the tendency to underestimate or overestimate, may have a clinical impact, and this should be taken into account in clinical practice. In the present study, the Nonin oximeter underestimated SaO2 in 91.3% of the measurements. For clinicians, this means that the SaO2 of the patient is probably above the displayed SpO2. With other tested oximeters, it is more difficult for the clinician to conclude if the SaO2 is above or below the displayed SpO2.\nThe Nonin oximeter has the largest bias but in return is more sensitive for the detection of hypoxemia. However, an oximeter that underestimates SaO2 can lead to exposing patients to hyperoxemia, which can also be deleterious.5-12 Therefore, clinicians need to decrease SpO2 targets when using this type of oximeter to avoid hyperoxemia.\nOn the other hand, an oximeter that mainly overestimates SaO2, such as the Philips oximeter, lowers the risks of exposing patients to hyperoxemia. However, the main objective of oximeters (ie, to detect hypoxemia) may be missed. Therefore, clinicians may need to increase SpO2 targets when using this type of oximeter to avoid hypoxemia.\nConcerning the oximeters that have low biases, as Nellcor and Masimo, SpO2 targets should not be adjusted, but clinicians must be aware of the weak accuracy of oximeters. This means that for a given SpO2 value displayed SaO2 may be as frequently both above or below expected.\nThere are potential clinical impacts that arise from a 2\u2013 3% bias between SaO2 and oximeters and from an even larger gap with several oximeters. Discrepancies related to skin pigmentation leading to occult hypoxemia in patients with dark skin have been described with potential impact on outcomes.36,40-42 In addition, the clinical decision to titrate oxygen may differ when using different SpO2 target recommendations13-15,43 and when using different oximeters. Our findings highlight the need for clinicians to be aware of the characteristics of the oximeter they use in their unit to avoid hypoxemia and hyperoxia and to adjust their SpO2 target. Current recommendations for SpO2 targets do not consider the variability related to oximeters used.13-15 However, the present study tends to show that the variability between the oximeters and the difference between the current SpO2 recommendations have a synergistic effect on the oxygenation parameters. Indeed, the O2 needs of a patient monitored with Philips oximeter following SpO2\ntarget recommendations of 90\u201394%15 would be greatly underestimated when compared with the O2 needs of a patient monitored with Nonin oximeter following SpO2 target recommendations of 94\u201398%.13 It has been shown that small variations of SpO2 targets may have a major impact on oxygen requirements.16,18,19 A secondary analysis is currently underway to further analyze the impact of the oximeters\u2019 inaccuracy on O2 management and on multiple clinical scores that use SpO2. In patients with ARDS, there is a potential risk of occult hypoxemia with an oximeter that overestimates SaO2 (Philips). This was shown to be potentially deleterious in severe subjects with shock.44 On the contrary, there is a risk to use unnecessary high FIO2 with oximeters that underestimate SaO2 (Nonin), with potential risk of denitrogenation atelectasis and delayed oxygen weaning. If the SpO2 target is adjusted to the oximeter used, these risks may be reduced. Another clinical consequence is that SpO2 targets with automated oxygen titration are now decreased to 90% (and 88% in patients with COPD) in our institution as a Nonin oximeter is used with this device.16\nOur findings suggest that targets used for the titration of O2 should be adapted to the oximeter used. Moreover, oxygen-free days has recently been proposed as a possible outcome marker in clinical trials,45 and this parameter may be influenced significantly by the type of oximeter used.46\nOur study has a number of limitations. The number of subjects included was relatively low compared to large databases.40 However, our method assured that the SpO2 values and the SaO2 values were taken exactly concomitantly, in subjects who had been stable for several minutes, whereas in studies using large databases the SaO2 value was matched with the SpO2 value within 5\u201310 min. 36,40-42 Knowing that oxygenation may vary within seconds after activity the only rigorous comparison of SaO2 and SpO2 requires concomitant measurements of SpO2 and SaO2 as we designed the study. Moreover, in the present study, the sampling made it possible to answer the main hypothesis: to demonstrate a difference of 0.5% between SaO2 and oximeters SpO2.\nOur study\u2019s main limitation is the low diversity of skin pigmentation of our subjects. More than 96% of the subjects had a Fitzpatrick score of 1 or 2, which reflects the local population but limits the applicability of our results to this specific population. Similar comparisons are required on patients with darker-skin pigmentation given the significant potential impact.36,40 In terms of detection of hypoxemia, we had a limited number of subjects with SaO2 < 90%, and these results must be confirmed. The absence of perfusion index value can also be raised as a limitation. However, our subjects were stable, thus not in shock, and a member of the research team made sure each patient had good perfusion before the measurements were taken. The RMSE was higher for the Nonin oximeter in the present study. However, even if it is required by the FDA, RMSE\n572 RESPIRATORY CARE MAY 2023 VOL 68 NO 5\nis not the best measure of oximeter accuracy and is unintelligible for most bedside clinicians. It is likely that the oximeters\u2019 bias are shifted in patients with dark pigmentation. It was around +0.5 with Nonin and +2.5% with Philips oximeter, as shown in Singh study conducted in India, leading to higher RMSE for Philips. Consequently, the RMSE value is probably more representative when included subjects have balanced skin pigmentations, which is not the case here. It should be reported for each subjects\u2019 subgroups of skin pigmentation as recently proposed.47"

            "text": "The present study shows that bias and accuracy of oximeters are variable. Each oximeter behaves differently; some overestimate the oxygenation (Philips FAST); some underestimate the oxygenation (Nonin embedded in the FreeO2), and others have mean SpO2 values close to the mean SaO2 value (Nellcor N-600 and Masimo Radical-7) but with significant inaccuracy. With the latter, it is thus difficult for clinicians to determine whether these overestimate or underestimate oxygenation. All 4 of the tested oximeters showed a moderate correlation with SaO2. Therefore, oximeters should be used knowing their limits; and when SpO2 is used by clinicians to target the oxygen flow or FIO2, the oxygenation targets should probably be adapted based on the oximeter and skin pigmentation. For example, with guidelines that recommend a target SpO2 between 92\u201396%, on a population with the same characteristics as studied in this paper, this target might be increased to 93\u201397% with the Philips oximeter tested in the study and decreased to 89\u201393% with the Nonin oximeter tested in the study. More values could be required to assess these guidelines modification suggestions.\nThese marked differences may partly explain the major variations in recent recommendations for oxygen therapy: from 90\u201394%15 to 92\u201396%14 to 94\u201398%.13,43,48 Despite the fact that the first pulse oximeters were described 50 years ago, and as these devices are now used daily by clinicians around the world, their characteristics should be better known to optimize their utilization for titrating and monitoring oxygen therapy."
