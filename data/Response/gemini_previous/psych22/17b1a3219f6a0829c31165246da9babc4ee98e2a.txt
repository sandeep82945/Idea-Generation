1. **Investigate the longitudinal effects of emotional intelligence (EI) on adolescent life satisfaction over a longer period.** This study only examined the effects of adolescent life satisfaction over a six-month period. It would be beneficial to examine these effects over a longer period, such as one year or two years, to see if the results are consistent.


2. **Examine the effects of different types of friendship quality on adolescent life satisfaction.** This study only looked at the overall quality of friendship, but it would be interesting to see how different types of friendship quality, such as the quality of friendships with family members, friends, or romantic partners, affect life satisfaction.


3. **Investigate the effects of optimism on adolescent friendship quality and life satisfaction.** This study found that optimism was a significant predictor of friendship quality and life satisfaction, but it did not examine the effects of optimism on these variables over time. It would be beneficial to examine these effects over time to see if optimism has a lasting impact on friendship quality and life satisfaction.


4. **Examine the effects of different types of emotional intelligence training programs on adolescent life satisfaction.** This study did not examine the effects of different types of emotional intelligence training programs on adolescent life satisfaction. It would be beneficial to examine the effects of different types of programs, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, or positive psychology interventions, to see which programs are most effective in improving adolescent life satisfaction.


5. **Investigate the effects of cultural factors on the relationship between emotional intelligence, friendship quality, optimism, and life satisfaction.** This study was conducted in China, and the results may not generalize to other cultures. It would be beneficial to examine the effects of cultural factors on the relationship between these variables in different cultures to see if there are any differences.
