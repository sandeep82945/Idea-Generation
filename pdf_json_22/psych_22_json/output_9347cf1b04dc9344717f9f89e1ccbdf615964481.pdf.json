In this research, instead of using gestational age criteria, we study attachment in infants born with very low birthweight. Although the collinearity between gestational age and birthweight is high, infants born with very low birthweight for their gestational age tend to stay more days in NICU and to have more comorbidities than other infants with the same gestational age. Thus, we wonder about the impact of low gestational birth (per se) in infants\u2019 regulatory behavior, the quality of mother-infant interactions, and attachment security. The participants are 71 infants with gestational weight lower than 1599 g (varying between 23 and 34 gestational weeks) and their mothers. Dyads were observed in free play and during Face to Face Still-Face paradigm with infants at 3 months of corrected age. At 12 months of corrected age, mother-infant attachment was observed during Strange Situation. Results indicate that infants with low/very low gestational birthweight have high levels of insecure attachment (70%) and nonpositive patterns of regulatory behavior (65%). Maternal and infant interactive behavior is highly associated with infant attachment. In turn, maternal interactive behavior is associated with gestational age, birthweight, and number of days in NUCI.",

            "text": "Attachment is the emotional bond that evolves between an infant and their consistent\ncaregivers (Bowlby, 1969). Infant securely attached use their caregivers as a secure base to explore from and a source of comfort and reassurance in the presence of challenges or perceived threats. In contrast, insecurely attached infants fail in their attempt to obtain protection to explore or to be comforted after stressful events by caregivers (Ainsworth & Eichberg, 1991). In cross-cultural research with full-term infants at low biological or social risk, the incidence of secure attachment varies between 63% and 77% (van Ijzendoorn & Sagi-Schwartz, 2008). However, these values drop in samples with preterm infants (PT, infants born before completing 37 weeks of gestation), particularly in those with sequels, comorbidities or at social risk \u2013 varying between 33% and 61% (revision in Fuertes et al., 2022). Yet, PT are more vulnerable to neurological abnormalities, physiological immaturities, and health comorbidities, and their families are more likely to face social and economic risks (McCormick et al., 2011). Therefore, it is possible to argue that prematurity itself is not a significant risk factor for attachment security. Still, by the propensity of risks associated with premature birth, it is likely that this condition contributes to a higher prevalence of insecure attachments compared with samples of infants born at term.\nInfants born with very low birthweight (less than 1500 g; VLBW) may be at higher risk to\ndevelop an insecure pattern of attachment with their mothers than other prematurely born infants, considering that this group (compared with others very preterm with higher birthweight) stays more days in NICU and have more neonatal risk factors (e.g., lack of oxygen). Such conditions lead to more comorbidities, developmental impairments and survival risk (Fanaroff et al., 2007; Neubauer et al., 2008). Thereby, mothers of VLBW experience more distress, trauma, and postnatal depression (Ionio et al., 2017). Moreover, resulting from their neurological immaturity,\ninfants with very low birthweight present more reactivity, more negativity, and less self-control than other infants (Wolf et al., 2002).\nAttachment and their determinants: studies with infants born with very low birthweight\nOnly a few studies were performed with infants born with very low birthweight (see table\n1) regardless of their prematurity status (i.e., number of gestational weeks at birth). Two studies were performed exclusively with infants born under 1500 g of gestational weight. Brisch et al. (2005) found 60% of security at 14 months of age in VLBW at low social risk. Another study found that attachment security drops from 55% at 14 months to 47% at 19 months of age (Mangelsdorf et al., 1996). Overall, these two studies indicate a lower incidence of secure attachment in VLBW than in infants born at full-term. It is also noteworthy that the incidence of avoidant attachment is above 20% in these two studies. Other studies included VLBW (revision in table 1), but not exclusively, and presented more dispersed results (e.g., attachment security varied between 75% and 30%).\nConsidering the characteristics of the samples (studies on table 1), it seems that security\nprevalence varies according to mothers\u2019 years of education and family SES (Social Economical Status). Also, it appears that infants\u2019 health status aggravates insecurity.\n(Plunkett et al., 1988)\nN=48 Two samples High Risk (sic or health sequels) \u2013 N= 30 Mean of BW = 1399 g (SD= 389) Mean weeks of GA = 30.6 (SD= 2.6). 58 days of hospitalization Low Risk (healthy infants N = 18) 10 days of hospitalization Mean of BW = 2134 g (SD= 245) Mean weeks of GA = 33.8 (SD= 1.9).\nStrange Situation Age of assessment: 36 months\nhigh-risk B \u2013 53 % A- 10% C - 37% low-risk B \u2013 67 % A- 28% C - 5%\nWhen looking for causes to explain the lower prevalence of secure attachment in samples\nwith VLBW, some studies found that mothers were more intrusive, controlling, and less sensitive, while infants presented less cooperative behavior (Ionio et al., 2017; Singer et al., 2010). Research performed in the context of Face to Face Still-Face (FFSF) experimental paradigm found that VLBW tends to present less self-directed and self-comforting behaviors during these experiences (Provenzi et al., 2017). Studying patterns of regulatory behavior in infants born with less than 32 weeks of gestational age (very/extreme preterm - VEP), Antunes et al. (2022) showed that SocialPositive Oriented regulatory pattern was associated with secure attachment, the DistressedInconsolable pattern was associated with insecure-ambivalent attachment, and the Self-Comfort Oriented pattern was associated with avoidant attachment. Moreover, this study indicates a much lower incidence of a Social-Positive Oriented regulatory pattern in VEP than full-term counterparts (Barbosa et al., 2018). Nevertheless, infants with a Social-Positive regulatory behavior can maintain positive states during maternal unavailability or easily recover after. These infants also engage in positive and reciprocal interactions during non-stressful interactions. According to our best knowledge, no study about infant patterns of regulatory behavior included exclusively VLBW.\nPresent Study. We add to this body of research a study about attachment security and their\ndeterminants in dyads with infants born exclusively with very/extremely low birthweight. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the attachment security, maternal and infant interactive behavior, and patterns of infant regulatory behavior at 12 months of corrected age in dyads with VLBW. Moreover, in this study, we are not excluding dyads at social and family risk, and we wonder how biological and social factors combined will affect our results."

Dyads were followed longitudinally from infants\u2019 birth to 12 months postpartum (corrected for gestational age).\nRecruitment of the sample took place over a two-year period before covid-19. Two research\nassistants contacted potential participants in the maternity wards and NICUs of Lisbon and Porto metropolitan hospitals and explained the study\u2019s purpose and procedures to them. To be eligible to participate in the present study, infants and mothers had to meet the following inclusion criteria. Infants had to have (a) birth weight less than 1500 g. Mothers had to be (a) at least 18 years old at the time of the infant\u2019s birth; (b) their infant\u2019s primary caregiver; and (c) free of any record of severe mental health or drug/alcohol addiction problems, as determined by medical record review and maternal self-report. Although we meant to include only infants with birthweight less than 1500 grams, we also included seven dyads with slightly heavier infants (but lighter than 1550 g) and one with 1595 g because infants tend to lose weight in the first days of life.\nPerinatal and Demographic characteristics. All information regarding infants\u2019 perinatal\ncharacteristics and demographic information were collected from hospital records (detailed information in table 2). No infants had sensory or neuromotor disabilities, serious illnesses, or congenital anomalies. Forty-three infants had infectious diseases and consumed antibiotics (60.6% of the sample) by medical prescription during the first year of their life.\nAbout 57.7 % of the mothers (N=41) were Portuguese-Caucasian from urban, employed,\nworking-class, and middle-class socioeconomic backgrounds and had more than nine years of formal education. Also, 28.2% Portuguese parents (mother or father, N=20) were unemployed (Portuguese unemployment rate is 6%). Around 15.5% (N=11) of the participants were from very low SES backgrounds, unemployed, less than nine years of education, and of African nationalities. Seven mothers were single mothers. Descriptive statistics for the perinatal and demographic characteristics of participants are provided in Table 2."

            "text": "All procedures in the present study were conducted according to the ethical guidelines\npresented in the Declaration of Helsinki, with written informed consent obtained from all participants or their legal guardians in the study before any assessment or data collection took place. All procedures were approved by the Ethics Committees of all Health Units and Hospitals involved, as well as by the Portuguese Data Protection Commission.\nAt 3 and 12 months postpartum (corrected age), mothers were contacted to schedule a\nfollow-up visit to the laboratory. Mother-infant dyads were videotaped during one free-play\nsituation and two laboratory paradigms: (1) the FFSF paradigm (Tronick et al., 1978) when infants were 3 months old and (2) the Strange Situation procedure (Ainsworth et al., 1978) when infants were 12 months old.\nFace-to-Face Still-Face paradigm (FFSF, Tronick et al., 1978). The FFSF paradigm\nincludes three successive three-minute episodes: (a) a face-to-face baseline interaction during which mothers were instructed to play with their infants as they normally would at home without using toys or pacifiers; (b) a still-face perturbation, during which mothers were instructed to keep a \u201cpoker face\u201d while looking at the infants, and to refrain from smiling, talking, or touching the infant; and (c) a reunion episode, during which mothers were instructed to resume their normal play interaction with the infant. To mark the beginning and the end of each episode more clearly for scoring purposes, each episode was separated by a 15-second interval during which the mother was asked to turn away from the infant.\nMothers and infants were videotaped during the FFSF using two cameras, one focused on\nthe mother\u2019s face and upper torso, and the other focused on the infant\u2019s face and body. Both cameras were connected to an image mixer software that generated a time-synchronized splitscreen image of each partner on a single video record.\nMother-infant free play interactions were assessed with Child-Adult Relationship\nExperimental Index (CARE-Index). According to the Care-Index manual (Crittenden, 2003), maternal sensitivity is any pattern of behavior that pleases the infant, increases the infant\u2019s comfort and attentiveness, and reduces his/her distress and disengagement. The CARE-Index was used to score qualitative dimensions of infant-adult interaction during free play at the 9-months lab visit. The CARE-Index system assesses seven aspects of mother-infant interactive behavior: facial\nexpressions, verbal expressions, position and body contact, affection, turn-taking contingencies, control, and choice of activity. Each adult and infant are evaluated separately in each of these seven dimensions of interactive behavior.\nThe points for each dimension are added to yield seven scale scores, three adult independent\nscales, namely Sensitivity, Control, Unresponsiveness and four independent infant scales, namely, Cooperative, Compliant-compulsive, Difficult, and Passive, behaviors (Crittenden, 2003). The videotaped free play interactions were scored by two trained and blind (against the study) coders on the CARE-Index. Intercoder reliability was evaluated by comparing the two coders\u2019 ratings using ICC-intraclass correlation coefficients (Cicchetti, 1994). The obtained overall average ICCs was .86. According to manual instructions, each interaction lasted five minutes (Crittenden, 2003).\nThe Strange Situation (Ainsworth et al., 1978) is a 21-minute laboratory-based\nobservational paradigm involving a sequence of eight brief (3-minutes) episodes (or less if the infant is distressed) of increasing stress for the infant, including being introduced to an unfamiliar playroom, interacting with an unfamiliar adult stranger, and two mother-infant separations and reunions."

This coding system describes three patterns of infants\u2019 regulatory behavior: Social-Positive Oriented pattern (i.e., infants exhibit predominantly positive social engagement and fully recover after maternal unavailability in the last episode of FFSF), Distressed-Inconsolable pattern (i.e., infants\ndisplay conspicuous negative affect that persists or increases across FFSF episodes), and SelfComfort Oriented pattern (i.e.., infants primarily engage in self-comforting behaviors and are uncomfortable during all episodes of FFSF), that were derived from four dimensions of infants\u2019 behavior and affective facial expressions across the three episodes of the FFSF paradigm: (a) behavior organization (e.g., the infant exhibits predominantly positive social behavior, distressed behavior, or self-comforting behavior, or a mixed-pattern behavior); (b) intensity of exhibited behavior (e.g., the infant displays prolonged and intense crying); (c) quality of behavior (e.g., the infant reacts by displaying signals denoting pleasure such as smiles, laughter, and reciprocal neutral or positive vocalizations); and (d) infants\u2019 ability to recover from negative affect during the reunion episode of the FFSF.\nThe FFSF videotapes were scored for infant regulatory patterns by three trained, reliable\ncoders. The intercoder agreement was calculated by Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficient. Results indicated\ngood agreement for all regulatory patterns (M = .74). Following the assessment of intercoder\nreliability, discrepant classifications were discussed and resolved in conference.\nAttachment Classifications. Videotapes of infants\u2019 attachment behavior during the Strange\nSituation were scored by two trained, reliable coders following the procedures developed by Ainsworth et al. (1978). Infants were classified as either securely attached (B), insecure-avoidant\n(A), insecure-ambivalent (C), or insecure-disorganized (D). Cohen\u2019s kappa coefficients (M = .89)\nindicated excellent intercoder reliability. Because only five cases (6.9% of the sample) were scored as D, there are not enough cases to present reliable results with disorganized attachment.\nAnalytic plan\nThree sets of statistical analyses were conducted to address the goals of the current study.\nFirst, the distribution of regulatory behavior patterns and attachment patterns were obtained using univariate frequency analysis. Second, cross-tabulations were performed to investigate the prevalence between the regulatory behavior patterns at 3 months and attachment patterns at 12 months. The chi-square test was used to determine group differences in prevalence. Additionally, the Bonferroni test correction was used as a measure of proportional reduction in error type I to predict patterns of attachment at 12 months based on patterns of regulatory behavior at 3 months. Third, bivariate statistics were used to evaluate the association between perinatal and demographic variables and (a) the three infant regulatory patterns at 3 months and (b) attachment classifications at 12 months. Fourth, correlational statistics were performed to study the association between perinatal and demographic variables and maternal and infant interactive behavior."

In the group of insecurely attached infants, 35.8% 33.8% (N=24) are avoidant, and 36.6% (N= 26) are ambivalent/resistant.\nMother-Infant Quality of Interaction in dyads with infants born with very low birthweight\nAccording to table 3, the means of maternal sensitivity and infant cooperativity in dyads\nwith infants born with very low birthweight are of moderate to low quality (less than 6 out of 14 points of maternal security/infant security means that dyads are at risk for interactive problems), while maternal control and infant cooperativity are the second most prevalent maternal and infant behaviors.\nPatterns of regulatory behavior and patterns of attachment Our findings, described in table 4, indicate a strong association between infants' regulatory behavior patterns and their attachment patterns (Fisher-Freeman-Halton = 42.146, p < 0.001,\nCramer\u2019s  = 0.579). In fact, most infants with a secure attachment at 12 months presented a Social\nPositive Oriented pattern of behavioral regulation at 3 months of age (71%), whereas infants classified as ambivalent attached presented Distressed Inconsolable patterns three months before (73%), and infants classified as avoidant at 12 months presented a Self-comfort Oriented pattern (67%) at 3 months (Figure 1).\nMother-infant interactive quality according to infant attachment\nOur results indicate differences in maternal and infant interactive behaviors according to\nattachment patterns (table 5). The values of maternal sensitivity and infant cooperativity are higher in dyads with infants securely attached, while maternal control and infant compulsivity are higher among avoidant attached infants, and maternal unresponsivity and infant difficulty are higher among infants ambivalent attached.\nDemographics according to infant patterns of regulatory behavior, mother-infant quality of interaction, and attachment\nNo association was found for Gestational age, Birthweight, Apgar at the first minute, Apgar\nat the fifth minute, Maternal age, Maternal years of education, and Number of Siblings, according to infant patterns of behavioral regulation observed at 3 months or to infant attachment patterns observed at 12 months (corrected age) in Strange Situation.\nHowever, maternal control was correlated with infant Gestational age (r=-.251; p =.035)\nand maternal passivity was correlated with infant Gestational age (r=-.304; p=.01) and Birthweight (r=-.254; p=.032). Infants who stayed more days in NICU had mothers with high scores of passivity (r= .309; p =.009). We also found that 51.1% (23/45) of the secure and avoidant attached\ninfants consumed antibiotics in the first 12 months of life, against 76.0% (19/25) of ambivalent attached infants [\u03c72(1) = 4.148; p =.042]."

            "text": "VLBW infants are very immature in terms of motor, mental, behavioral, and emotional\ndevelopment and have a high risk for survival. This study adds to the body of research about attachment security of preterm, an investigation about mother-infant attachment and their possible determinants in dyads with infants born with very low birthweight. For that purpose, we studied 71 infant-mother dyads in free play, during the Face to Face Still-Face paradigm when infants were 3-months old of corrected age, and in Strange Situation at 12 months of corrected age.\nOur findings indicate an impressive high prevalence of insecure attachment (70%). Other\nPortuguese studies (Antunes et al., 2022) with infants born very or extremely preterm have also found critical levels of insecurity (around 60%). Research performed with VLBW in other European countries and in the USA (Brisch et al., 2005; Mangelsdorf et al., 1996) also found a lower incidence of secure attachment than in infants born at full-term (47%-60%). Indeed, these values contrast with the findings obtained in Portuguese dyads with full-term infants from middleclass households, where attachment insecurity drops to 30% or less (Barbosa et al., 2021; Fuertes et al., 2016, 2022).\nIn the case of this study, we can also explain the lower levels of attachment security with\nthe presence of social risks (e.g., Low SES, Parents unemployment, Low maternal education). Indeed, the incidence of attachment security in PT tends to decrease in the presence of other social risks factors, such as low SES (Wille, 1991) or low parental education (Fuertes et al., 2009; Pederson & Moran, 1996; Ruiz et al., 2018). Such findings corroborate the premises of the\nTransactional Model of Sameroff & Fiese (2000), which proposes that \u201cthe development of the child is a product of the continuous dynamic interactions of the child and the experience provided by his or her social settings\u201d (p.1). The transactional model emphasizes the bidirectional and interdependent effects of the children\u2019s contribution, their social partners\u2019 feedback, and experiences in life contexts. Preterm, particularly those with very or extremely low birthweight, are prone to greater risks during their stay in the NICU (e.g., infections or cerebral hemorrhage), leaving the parents anxious and concerned with their survival. Furthermore, parents feel detached and separated from their infants, as they cannot interact as freely with their infants as they would at home (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2020). At the same time, VLBW struggles to respond and react to their parents\u2019 stimulus resulting from their altered health and neurofunction status. Adding parents worries to infants\u2019 difficulties, the interaction evolves from transactional processes to disengagement or persistent negative states. Corroborating this perspective, we found lower maternal sensitivity and infant cooperative behavior in this sample compared with FT (Barbosa et al., 2019).\nAs it has been documented (both with full-term and preterm infants), the secure attachment\nwas positively associated with infant Social-Positive Oriented regulatory pattern during FFSF and with maternal sensitivity and infant cooperative behavior in free play interactions (Barbosa et al., 2019, 2021; Fuertes et al., 2022). The insecure-ambivalent attachment was positively associated with infant Distressed-Inconsolable regulatory pattern, maternal unavailability/passivity in free play, and Antibiotic uptake during the first year of life. Finally, the avoidant attachment was positively associated with the infant Self-Comfort Oriented pattern regulatory pattern in FFSF, and in free-play interactions with maternal control and infant compliance. Moreover, avoidant attachment was negatively associated with infant difficult behavior in free play interactions.\nOverall, we found that infants exhibit coherent behavior patterns both in stressful situations observed in experimental paradigms such as Strange Situation or FFSF and at regular free play interactions.\nSupporting the significance of maternal behavior in this transactional process, we also\nfound that maternal passivity was negatively correlated with infant gestational age and gestational weight, and positively correlated with the number of days that infants stayed in NICU. We speculate that VLBW responses are affected by their health condition and neuroprocessing while the pos-natal maternal experiences affect maternal behavior. It is important to stress that some infants stayed more than 200 days in the NUCI, leaving mother-infant relationships on hold. Both (infant and maternal behavior) mutually affecting and affected by infant regulatory behavior and dyadic mutual regulation, may lead to the impressive amount of insecure attachment that we found.\nAlso, a tendency for higher prevalence avoidant attachment seems persistent in samples\nthat included VLBW compared with samples of infants born at full-term (Brisch et al., 2005; Mangelsdorf et al., 1996). It is possible that the very intrusive and painful healthcare provided in NUCI to newborns (although necessary) may shape infants\u2019 ability to cope with these experiences by withdrawing and self-managing. Another explanation, drawn from our results, is that infant compliance and ability to self-comfort facing maternal controlling and intrusive behavior lead to avoidant attachment.\nInterestingly, 76% of the ambivalent-attached infants took antibiotics in the first year of\ntheir lives (against 51% of secure and avoidant attached infants). Such contrasting proportions agree with past research, which shows that 90% of the infants classified as ambivalent attached took antibiotics in the first nine months of life against 35% of secure and avoidant (Fuertes et al., 2020). The authors of this study, performed with infant born at least with 32 weeks of gestation\nand more than 1500 g of birthweight, argued that ambivalent attached infants exacerbate their emotions (e.g., over-emotional angry and fear responses expressed by heavy crying, inability to self-soothe or strong motor reactions), eventually raising concern to their parents and health professionals, which may lead to higher antibiotic prescription.\nAlthough VLBW newborns\u2019 lives are in danger in the first days/months, it is also crucial\nto invest in parents\u2019 psychological support, reinforce parenting policies and practices during \u201cfamilies\u201d stay in NICU, and support parents during the home transition and after the hospital discharge. In Portugal, the general practice is to provide early intervention services only after infants\u2019 discharge form NICU. We propose that these services be available to families during the newborn\u2019s hospitalization in partnership health teams. Past research found that these interventions can effectively support parents\u2019 behavior and parents-infant relationships (Benzies et al., 2013) once provided in a continuous and individualized process during children\u2019s first years of life."

First, the sample size is relatively small, reducing statistical power when we analyze the distribution of groups. For instance, the distribution of infant regulatory patterns by attachment patterns has less than five occurrences in some categories. Second, this sample has multiple associated risks, as expected for samples with infants born with very low birthweight. Nevertheless, our results cannot be explained only in the light of one single factor (birthweight), but as the result of a complex array of risk factors that these infants face.\nStrengths of this study include its longitudinal, prospective design, the use of direct\nobservations of mother-infant interaction at 3months and attachment at 12 months (corrected age), the inclusion of an understudied group of infants born with very low birthweight, and careful\nevaluation of biological and demographic factors as potential covariates. Thus, we believe the current findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge about attachment in infants born preterm.\nConflict of interest statement: None of the authors have any conflicts of interest."
