    "abstractText": "Chagas disease is derived from the infection by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. In many countries, benznidazole is the only drug approved for clinical use despite several side effects and the emergence of resistant parasite strains. In this context, our group has previously pointed out that two novel aminopyridine derivatives complexed with Cu2+, namely, cis-aquadichloro(N[4-(hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-2-pyridinemethamino)copper (3a) and its glycosylated ligand cis-dichloro (N-{[4-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)pheny]lmethyl}-2-pyridinemethamino)copper (3b), are effective against T. cruzi trypomastigote forms. With this result in mind, the present work aimed to investigate the effects of both compounds on trypomastigotes physiology and on the interaction process with host cells. Apart from loss of plasma membrane integrity, an increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased mitochondrial metabolism were observed. Pretreatment of trypomastigotes with these metallodrugs inhibited the association index with LLC-MK2 cells in a typical dose-dependent manner. Both compounds showed low toxicity on mammalian cells (CC50 > 100 \u03bcM), and the IC50 values calculated for intracellular amastigotes were determined as 14.4 \u03bcM for 3a and 27.1 \u03bcM for 3b. This set of results demonstrates the potential of these aminopyridines complexed with Cu2+ as promising candidates for further antitrypanosomal drug development.",

Transmission is classically through triatomine insects, but other forms are also seen, such as blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and ingestion of contaminated food [2].

Around 30% of patients will develop some sort of chronic phase forms, such as chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), which is the biggest cause of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) in Latin America and can lead to sudden cardiac death (SCD) in most cases [3]. Chagas disease is considered one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) by the World Health Organization [4], which aims to eliminate these infections as a public health problem by 2030 [5]. The impact is even more important because of the current limited therapeutic arsenal. Only two therapeutic options are currently available to treat Chagas disease: the nitroheterocyclic compounds benznidazole (BZ) and nifurtimox. In many countries, including Brazil, BZ is used as the unique first-line treatment due to the great uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of nifurtimox [6]. The BZ therapy has a cure rate of 80% of patients in the acute phase, but only 20% in the chronic phase [7]. The low efficacy, emergence of new resistant strains, and many side effects make the only treatment option for this illness unsuitable [8,9]. In this regard, new compounds have been evaluated to seek an alternative to treatment for Chagas disease; however, none of the compounds tested in clinical trials so far has surpassed BZ efficacy [10\u201312]. Therefore, these treatment limitations compel the discovery of novel effective and safe molecules to combat this infection. In this scenario, the use of metal complexes associated with repurposed/novel drugs is a new line of research that is gaining attention, since many of these compounds can be bactericidal, fungicidal, and even present antiparasitic action [13\u201318]. In this sense, a previous study from our group showed that two aminopyridine derivatives complexed with Cu2+, namely, cis-aquadichloro(N-[4-(hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-2-pyridinemethamino)copper (3a) and its glycosylated ligand cis-dichloro(N-{[4-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosylox y)pheny]lmethyl}-2-pyridinemethamino)copper (3b), were effective against the infective form (trypomastigote) of T. cruzi, while non-toxic action was reported for RAW macrophages [19]. Based on these data, the present work aimed to evaluate the effects of both promising metal-based compounds on crucial biological processes of T. cruzi trypomastigotes, including plasma membrane integrity, mitochondrial physiology, intracellular redox status, and lipid storage. In addition, the action on the parasite-host cell interaction was evaluated in order to check the possible anti-amastigote effect."

            "text": "In the present work, two aminopyridine derivatives complexed with copper were assayed in T. cruzi trypomastigotes using a set of experiments: (i) analysis of cell viability; (ii) determination of mitochondrial functioning and ROS production; (iii) neutral lipid accumulation; (iv) inhibition of trypomastigote invasion in LLC-MK2 cells; (v) cytotoxicity to mammalian cells; and (vi) verification of the effects on intracellular amastigotes. The antiT. cruzi activity of the Cu(II) complex 3a and its glycosylated ligand 3b has been previously evaluated, showing significantly better efficacy toward trypomastigote forms (LD50 values of 1.7 and 1.8 \u00b5M, respectively) than the current clinical drug benznidazole (LD50 value 3.8 \u00b5M) [19]. The treatment of trypomastigotes with both compounds caused relevant morphological changes when compared to the typical appearance of non-treated parasites, including rounding in shape with reduced cell size, swelling of the cell body and shortening or loss of flagellum [19]. The significant increase in PI-labeling of cells after treatment with both compounds, as detected in the present work, indicates that these metallodrugs induced loss of parasite viability in a typical concentration-dependent manner, corroborating the morphological alterations previously observed by our group [19]. The alterations in mitochondrial dehydrogenase activities and \u2206\u03a8m loss findings in addition to ROS production, support the notion that the imbalance in mitochondrial functionality can strongly contribute to protozoal death induced by the metallodrugs 3a and 3b. A special characteristic of trypanosomatids is the presence of a single elongated mitochondrion in the cytoplasm; therefore, the proper function of this organelle, whose major role is energy production, is fundamental for survival [25]. Experimental studies about the mechanisms of action of conventional and novel antitrypanosomatid compounds point out that mitochondrion can be considered one of the most important targets for drug inhibitory action [25,26]. In response to changes in the intracellular environment by different stress signals, such as the presence of different molecules, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, mitochondria become producers of excessive ROS [27]. The mitochondrial damage observed in the results described herein relates to the fundamental role of this organelle in the overall metabolism of the parasite, which may lead to cell death. Neutral lipid accumulation was also tested in the present work, but only observed in cells treated with the highest concentration tested (2 \u00d7 LD50 doses). So, this may be considered a secondary effect of both compounds. Mammalian host cell recognition of T. cruzi trypomastigotes involves the interaction of numerous parasite and host cell membrane molecules and domains, and is a fundamental step for T. cruzi infection development [28]. Once the establishment of stable interactions of trypomastigotes with the vertebrate host relies on parasite\u2019s surface molecules, the reduced association indexes described herein suggest a possible interference of both compounds in the early steps of LLC-MK2 cells\u2019 infection, either through blockage of ligand/receptor binding or through suppression of ligand/receptor expression [28]. Our work continued through the determination of the CC50 values for both metallodrugs in LLC-MK2 cells: 125.7 \u00b5M for compound 3a and 175.2 \u00b5M for compound 3b. In comparison, these compounds exhibited low toxicity toward RAW macrophages as well, with CC50 values of 106.2 \u00b5M and 127.6 \u00b5M, respectively [19]. Based on the calculated CC50 values for LLCMK2 cells and the LD50 values for trypomastigote forms, attractive selectivity indexes (SI) were determined for compounds 3a (73.9) and 3b (97.3). The promising efficacy of both compounds, with higher toxicity to trypomastigotes compared with mammalian cells, stimulated the study of their effects on the replicative amastigote forms of the parasite. Our results showed that these metallodrugs were able to reduce the survival of intracellular amastigotes, but not at levels considered promising. The IC50 value for 3a was calculated as 14.4 \u00b5M, and that for 3b as 27.1 \u00b5M. Based on these IC50 values, both compounds showed a higher toxicity to T. cruzi amastigotes compared to LLC-MK2 cells, resulting in moderately satisfactory SI values: 8.73 for compound 3a and 6.46 for 3b. In general, only molecules with SI >10 are currently selected for in vivo studies [24]. Since amastigotes are present in an intracellular protective environment and\nTrop. Med. Infect. Dis. 2023, 8, 288 12 of 15\ntherefore are less exposed to direct contact with these compounds, this may explain the IC50 values calculated for this intracellular form being higher than those calculated for trypomastigotes. Altogether, these data point to the activity of these metallodrugs against the clinically relevant stages of T. cruzi, with emphasis on trypomastigote forms. Several authors have pointed to copper complexes as a promising alternative to fight tropical parasitic infections, such as Chagas disease [14,16,17,29\u201334]. Many are the ligands derived from organic compounds that have been used in coordination chemistry, and the antiparasitic activity is often considerably improved by the presence of the metal ion [18,34]. The combination of metal ions with drugs and organic ligands can enhance their activity while, at the same time, reduce the toxicity and undesired side effects that metal ions on their own could impart [18,19,35]. In this regard, the non-metalated ligands of compounds 3a and 3b showed significantly higher LD50 values (4.6 and 5.3 \u00b5M, respectively) than the corresponding copper complexes (1.7 and 1.8 \u00b5M, respectively) [19]. It is also clear that copper, per se, is not responsible for the studied anti-T. cruzi activity, since the simple salt CuCl2 did not show significant toxicity to the parasite [19]. Although it seems clear that Cu(II) coordination enhances the antiparasitic activity of these ligands, the moderate improvement detected for compounds 3a and 3b suggests that metal complexation does not prompt the synergistic effects as reported for some antitrypanosomal metal complexes [16\u201318,30]. In this case, it is proposed that Cu(II) provides additional affinity for the target binding sites [19]. Copper-containing coordination compounds were found to be promising antitumor therapeutic agents that act by various mechanisms, such as inhibition of proteasome activity, telomerase activity, ROS formation, DNA degradation, DNA intercalation, paraptosis, among others [34]. Some of the antitrypanosomal Cu(II) complexes reported in the literature bind to DNA [16\u201318,31]. However, the active compounds 3a and 3b were also screened previously for toxicity against larvae of Galleria mellonella, a model organism used as a surrogate to probe the response of the human innate immune system, and all the larvae treated with both compounds at concentrations as high as 100 \u00b5M kept their viability up to 48 h [19]. This result, together with the high SI values found for trypomastigotes, suggests that both compounds are not likely to affect high affinity DNA binding. In the present work, copper complexes induced significant alterations in the mitochondrial metabolism and ROS production, which may imply this organelle as one of the major targets of both compounds, as detected in many other antitrypanosomal molecules [25,26]. The fact that mammalian cells present multiple mitochondria allows a mechanism of compensation in the presence of altered organelles, which raises specificity [27]. The influence of the addition of a glucosyl moiety to 3a, originating in 3b, can be discussed. Although carbohydrate conjugation is an attractive means of improving the selectivity of bioactive molecules, the water-soluble character of saccharides can compromise their ability to cross cellular membranes. Therefore, the use of an acetylated sugar, as it occurs in compound 3b, with increased hydrophobicity and for which the acetyl groups would undergo hydrolysis after administration, is often preferred [19,36]. In this sense, compounds 3a and 3b showed a similar range of antitrypanosomal activity, as determined previously by the LD50 values calculated for trypomastigote forms [19] and in the present work by the equivalent action on the loss of parasite viability, mitochondrial metabolism, and interaction of trypomastigotes with LLC-MK2 cells. However, compound 3b, bearing a glycosylated ligand of 3a, was found to be less toxic to RAW macrophages [19] and LLCMK2 cells than its counterpart 3a. Since survival of intracellular amastigotes, on the other hand, was higher in the presence of 3b in comparison to 3a, this may confirm the trend observed for other classes of antiparasitic compounds where the increase in lipophilicity seems to favor the compound distribution to the intracellular target [37]."

A strategy used to decrease toxicity and increase the activity is through structural modifications; consequently, a series of derivatives generated through structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies need to be tested against both extracellular trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigotes in the future. Our results indicate that such compounds can be a useful platform for the design of new antichagasic drugs, since structural modifications may contribute to the improvement of the activity and safety of these molecules.\nAuthor Contributions: R.S.-O., L.S.S., A.R., T.V.-T., A.L.S.S. and M.H.B. conceived and designed the experiments.
