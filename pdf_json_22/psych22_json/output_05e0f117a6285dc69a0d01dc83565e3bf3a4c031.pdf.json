    "abstractText": "Albeit poverty reduction has been listed as an overarching objective in many countries\u2019 development plans, little is known about how development could shape poverty dynamics in disadvantaged groups. Guided by a modified capability framework, this study aimed to explore the long-term experiences of poverty dynamics in severe mental illness. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 20 caregivers who provided care for persons with severe mental illness in Chengdu, China. Their perceptions on development, the illness, and social security were addressed. Content analysis was employed to analyze data. Participants experienced an overall improvement of life quality due to changes on urban infrastructure and transformed lifestyle. However, they were more disadvantaged while facing ability-based opportunities. These families were hindered from transferring opportunities into incomes. Negative impacts of the illness were also reflected in multiple stigma and conversion difficulties. Additionally, the high threshold for payment made those inclusive social security policies not inclusive for them. Poverty associated with severe mental illness was unlikely to be alleviated automatically within the process of development. Social isolation and high caregiving burden had aggravated poverty for those disadvantaged families. Poverty alleviation should be closely linked to the improvement in social policies in China.",

There is also an increasing interest in understanding poverty dynamics shaped by development [2\u20134]. Studies show that development could be a double-edged sword on poverty reduction. On one hand, growth-led development has a trickle-down effect, which benefits poverty reduction through boosting income-earning opportunities and aggregating wealth for redistribution [5,6]. Development-oriented anti-poverty policies were highly favored and widely implemented around the world. Partly as a result, the international community has made remarkable achievements in reducing extreme poverty. On the other hand, new evidence has been acquired, which shows that development may not naturally lead to poverty reduction. Opportunities are less likely to be equally distributed throughout the whole population [7]. Some vulnerable groups have been structurally marginalized by the labor market, turning more disadvantaged within the development process. These groups include the elderly, the disabled, persons with severe mental illness, and many others [8,9]. Promoting development may be too simplified for a complicated issue like poverty, as it is still unclear about the form that development benefits might take, and the speed at which it might occur for disadvantaged groups [10].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 2351. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042351 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 2351 2 of 13\nDiscussions related to the social effect of growth-led development in China resulted in a fundamental paradigm shift on poverty reduction. For a long time, development was taken as a core strategy to combat poverty in China. The government launched a whole package of programs to stimulate economic development after the reform and openingup [11]. As a positive outcome of remarkable economic growth, China had contributed over 70% of the total global achievement on poverty reduction [12]. In recent years, more attention has been paid to disadvantaged groups that cannot \u2018be developed\u2019. Targeted poverty alleviation had dominated the anti-poverty discourse [13]. Guided by this new paradigm, appropriate anti-poverty responses should be varied according to the causes of poverty, the impoverished types, and specific development context. By the end of 2020, China had eradicated extreme poverty and stepped into a new era of alleviating relative poverty [14]. This targeted poverty alleviation paradigm is also applicable in the so-called post-poverty era. Whether, to what extent, and in what form disadvantaged groups can share the fruits of development constitute a series of fundamental questions for international poverty alleviation practices, as well as for China\u2019s \u2018common prosperity\u2019 campaign [15]. In the era of targeted poverty alleviation, it is necessary to learn from those disadvantaged groups, to understand their living experiences and decision-making processes that may have kept them in disadvantaged positions or lifted them out of poverty [16,17]. However, there were few such studies, particularly in the Chinese context, where a distinct group of people remain relatively poor despite extraordinary social prosperity [18]. To achieve an in-depth understanding on how development may have benefited poverty alleviation for disadvantaged groups, this study applied qualitative research methods to explore the experience of poverty dynamics in severe mental illness (SMI). SMI is characterized as mental, behavioral, or emotional disorders that can result in serious disability [19]. There were over 16 million persons with SMI in China by 2009 [20]. People with SMI are at an increased risk of drifting into or remaining in poverty due to reduced productivity, increased medical costs, and loss of employment-associated earnings [21]. Because of strong stigma associated with mental illness, evidence shows that they are more disadvantaged than most other vulnerable groups [22\u201324]. Negative impacts of SMI may also occur at the household level, especially in societies that rely on families to provide patient care and financial support. Having a family member with SMI is associated with treatment costs, caregiving, and income loss [25]. In general, those households are less likely to benefit from the trickle-down effect of external development [8]. Accordingly, a wider range of people could be affected by SMI. Given the representativeness, a study to explore the experience of poverty dynamics in SMI can provide a good example to show how development in China may have shaped the fates of disadvantaged people, as well as how the government and society should further respond. In this study, the capability approach, proposed by Amartya Sen, was modified to fit the research objectives and context. Guided by this framework, research questions addressed in this paper included: (1) How did people live in SMI make sense of development and interpret the impacts of changes; (2) How did SMI exert negative impacts and keep people in long-term disadvantaged positions; (3) What was the role of social security on poverty alleviation for them? This paper first introduced the modified capability framework and then presented findings on each question. Two family cases were further elaborated to show the interactions of different forces in shaping poverty dynamics. Albeit in the same context, one family fell into poverty and another escaped."

It was related to the Chengdu Mental Health Project (CMHP), a longitudinal project on mental illness and mental health services in Xinjin County, Chengdu [19]. Chengdu is the provincial city of Sichuan province. During the past few decades, Xinjin experienced huge development.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 2351 3 of 13\nDetails of its achievements were described elsewhere [8]. Briefly, it had shifted from a middle-income rural county to one of the most favored investment places in Western China. Previously, a study using follow-up data demonstrated the poverty transitions for persons with SMI (n = 308) living in Xinjin for over 20 years (1994\u20132015). Overall, a larger proportion of them had fallen into poverty rather than escaped from it. Nevertheless, there were still 17.8% percent of them that managed to escape [21]. Based on what was known, this study was designed to further learn the experience of poverty dynamics behind the statistical numbers presented in the previous study. The capability approach proposed by Amartya Sen was applied and modified accordingly [26,27]. The term \u2018capability\u2019 refers to the array of social functions that a person, in a certain social context, could perform. One\u2019s capability depends on the surrounding environment, the availability of resources (e.g., commodities from the market, public goods), and a set of personal characteristics (e.g., age, gender, and health status). Feasible utilization of these endowments forms the basic capability sets for individuals. Without the capabilities to convert potential endowments into commodities, one can be poor anytime [28]. Figure 1 shows the modified framework for this study. Three major forces were considered for interpreting poverty dynamics in SMI. One was the trickle-down effect of fast economic growth, which had formed the surrounding environment [6]. The other was the government\u2019s effort on social security, which may have improved the \u2018availability of resources\u2019 for persons with SMI and their families [29]. Social marginalization associated with SMI, as has been frequently mentioned [30,31], were viewed as the \u2018group characteristics\u2019, which had also played a role on shaping poverty dynamics.\nInt.

Participants and Data Collection Purposive sampling method was applied. Data collection was finished in three steps (Figure 2). First, a list of 80 out of 308 persons with SMI was created based on the CMHP dataset, with sufficient considerations on sampling diversity and confidentiality. Cases that never experienced poverty, experienced persistent poverty, escaped from poverty, and fell into poverty during 1994\u20132015 were all considered. Second, with the help from community health workers, the authors contacted the caregivers of listed persons with SMI. Caregivers were assumed to be more capable to share experiences on poverty dynamics, especially the negative impacts of caregiving. All interviews were arranged in local health-care centers. Given the distance, caregivers aged beyond 80 were excluded from the list of contacts. Some participants may fear losing face while being involved, and the confidentiality was considered. For each village, only one caregiver was recruited. Those who cannot communicate well were also excluded. Based on previous experience\ni r . o ifie ca ilit r c t i ter ret ert ics i I."

Their interpretations of development can be encoded into both changes on living environment and income-earning opportunities. When asked about development there, most participants first thought of a transformed city landscape, including visible changes on buildings, roads, and factories, which formed a typical picture of urbanization. For the last decade or two, a large proportion of farmlands there were claimed for urban construction or contracted for large-scale cultivation. Many people moved into settlement apartments provided by the government. Rural lifestyle changed. People were more reliant on the market. Those changes enabled them to experience an overall improvement of life quality, as they felt happier, safer, and more convenient:\nContracting land out not only reduced manual work, but also made me feel safe. Agricultural incomes can be greatly affected by the climate. Now, regardless of the climate, the income is more stable. That is the best part of becoming a city dweller. (No. 3).\nThere were also some identity-based income sources that had contributed to improving their economic status. By saying identity-based, it means that anyone with a registered permanent residence (i.e., Hukou) in Xinjin is eligible to share the dividends of development policies. For example, as compensations of land acquisition, previous farmers were provided with resettlement housing and a monthly stipend. Many families were allocated more than one apartment, adding them extra income from leasing. For those who remained living in rural areas, the large-scale cultivation also increased their income. These benefits may be icing on the cake for others, but they were of paramount significance for households of a person with SMI. As participant No.16 noted:\nAfter our farmlands were claimed, every month I can receive around three thousand CNY. For a family like ours, this was the biggest revenue. Without it, I cannot image how hard our life could have been. (No. 16)\nDevelopment in Xinjin also created more income-earning opportunities for local people. Compared with farming, these new opportunities required higher personal abilities. Because of functional impairment, persons with SMI were not fully capable of participating in the labor market. Their high demands on caregiving also hindered other family members\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 2351 6 of 13\nfrom learning new skills and seizing those emerging opportunities. As a result, those trickled down opportunities had little positive impacts on them. Instead, it increased their income gaps with others.\nThose opportunities are for others, not for us. No matter how much others have earned, that\u2019s their fates. I have a wife with schizophrenia. I must stay at home to provide care. Poverty is my fate. (No. 8)"

Apart from common recognized reasons such as income loss, medical costs, and caregiving burden, negative impacts of SMI were also reflected in multiple stigma and conversion difficulties for those families. Caregivers experienced strong stigma and social isolation due to the disease. Worried about safety, their neighbors avoided interacting with those persons with SMI, and were also negative for other family members. They were even isolated from important kinship relations because their relatives felt ashamed. In the Chinese society, maintaining a social network was of paramount significance in reciprocating favors and earning income. SMI had resulted in a sharp reduction of social network, restricting their capabilities to access resources."

Having a person with SMI made families more likely to be poor within the development process. Poverty, in turn, became another source of stigma. Poor families were viewed as hopeless ones. They were discriminated by richer ones. Self-stigma on poverty further resulted in social withdrawal.\nWe had richer relatives. I gave them gifts and was rejected. They despised me. They were afraid that I may ask them for help. I kept myself away from neighbors. Every time I visited them, I felt depressed to see them being better off. I had no social network. (No. 5)\nFamilies of persons with SMI also faced conversion difficulties. In case of having similar resources, they cannot achieve the same living standard as others. Instead, their weakness accumulated. For example, because of having a family member with SMI, a marriage-aged man with sufficient resources to start a normal family compromised to marry a disabled woman. It further increased the family dependency ratio and deteriorated the economic condition (No. 11). Another example was a school-aged man who was bullied by having a \u2018freaky\u2019 grandfather and dropped out. Without adequate education, he was not capable of getting a good job (No. 18). Overall, SMI ruined the sustainability of a family and made poverty pass down from one generation to the next. As Participant No. 7 noted:\nMental illness may affect at least three generations. The illness on my mother affected her generation, mine and my kids\u2019. When I was young, only my father worked to support the whole family. We lived in poverty and I dropped out from school early. As a result, I was not capable to find a well-paid job. I cannot work far away because I need to keep an eye on her. The current situation will inevitably affect my children. (No. 7)"

It had provided strong support for elderly life, and also partly relieved the younger generation. It should be noted that the endowment insurance did not shape poverty in a single direction. It had alleviated poverty for some families and aggregated it for others, at least in the short term. Benefiting from this scheme required payments in advance. Paying for insurance constituted a new poverty trap for some poor families, especially those where the family heads were in their 50s. They were less competitive in the labor market but pressured with insurance payment and other family duties. Instead of being protected, those families were even more vulnerable."

Albeit in the same context, the former fell into poverty while the latter managed to escape. By the time of conducting this interview, Participant No. 1 was a 42-year-old unemployed woman. She lived together with her husband, daughter, mother (the person with SMI), father, and mother-in-law. Based on her narratives, their economic status improved from the early 1990s when there were more working opportunities. After their farmlands were contracted, both she and her husband worked in nearby factories. Their living conditions improved steadily until her father died in 2012. After that, she quit her job to provide full-time care for her mother. Their family income decreased. Meanwhile, their expenditures on elderly care, education, and endowment insurance payments increased. All those pressures drove the family into poverty.

            "text": "This study offered a meaningful framework to interpret the experiences and conceptualizations of development from the perspective of caregivers for persons with SMI in China. It modified the capability approach, a guiding framework in poverty studies, according to a specific context. The trickle-down effect of economic growth, negative impacts of SMI, and government\u2019s effort to strengthen the social security system were examined from the participant\u2019s perspective. An inductive thematic approach was applied to analyze their narratives. In general, development was beneficial for improving their life quality. However, caregiving burden, stigma, and poverty associated with SMI hindered their abilities to convert trickle-down opportunities into real income. Social security was expected to further alleviate poverty for disadvantaged groups. In reality, it played a complex role in shaping poverty dynamics. Although much work has discussed the relationship between development and poverty reduction [7,34\u201336], little is known about whether and in what form development is beneficial for pulling disadvantaged people out of poverty, as it can do for others [11].\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 2351 9 of 13\nStudies showed that the burden of SMI was very high for Chinese families during a period of fast development [37]. Albeit their mean income increased sharply within the development process, the wealth distribution had also become more unequal, thus the proportion of poor households increased instead [8]. As the long-term evidence on social drift accumulated [21], in what way the burden of SMI may have interacted with external development forces to shape poverty dynamics became a new question. This study applied qualitative research methods, unveiling the experiences of people who live through it. Despite it being widely recognized that development can be beneficial for the poor [6], there were also numerous exceptions where it affected them negatively [1,7]. Drawing from experiences at the individual level, this study revealed that development did both good and harm to disadvantaged people. Development involved changes in infrastructure, lifestyle, and ways of earning income. The urbanization process had offered more identity-based income and improved the life quality for those persons with SMI and their family members. In this way, they were capable of sharing the dividends of development [38]. Nevertheless, a more developed society also required higher personal abilities, especially their work skills. The development context made employment an important arena in which SMI individuals and their families interacted [39]. SMI not only resulted in productivity and income loss for persons with SMI, but also their family members. They were called upon to provide care and thus were hindered from transferring income-earning opportunities into actual incomes. The bonus based on identities was far less than benefits from the market. Accordingly, although disadvantaged people can partly benefit from development, they lagged further behind. Social security was expected to alleviate poverty through income redistribution [40]. In reality, its role in shaping poverty was complex. The effectiveness of social security in poverty alleviation had been doubted in many studies [41,42]. This qualitative study provided more details on how different types of social security programs may have increased the income gap instead of narrowing it for households of persons with SMI. Consistent with previous research, those inclusive social security schemes may not be inclusive as they ignored the existing disadvantages of certain groups [43]. For the endowment insurance program, people received returns based on their ability to pay. A relatively high payment threshold contributed to drive people into, or at least increased, their vulnerability of falling into poverty. People without payment ability were squeezed out from later returns and became poorer in their old age. Although special considerations were given for schemes that targeted persons with SMI, in general, they were far behind the demands. In the Chinese context, a diagnosis of mental illness was a strong event for losing face, which could isolate a family from mutual help to maintain good life quality [44]. In addition to the stigma of mental illness, this study also highlighted the stigma of poverty. They mixed together, perpetuated, or at least amplified poverty in SMI in the long term. Guided by the modified capability approach, two cases were further elaborated in this study. Albeit in the same development context, case No. 1 fell into poverty while No. 19 escaped from it. Consistent with other studies [45,46], these two cases demonstrated the negative impacts of high caregiving burden on depriving the family from taking advantage of development opportunities. The illness did not necessarily lead to poverty. Instead, it increased the vulnerability of a household [43]. When it met other risk factors, such as excessive caregiving needs, accidents, and unemployment, those burdens may squeeze together and trap people deeply into poverty [47]. Chronic poverty is at the forefront of targeting poverty policy debates [2,48]. Compared to the past, current poverty reduction may be more difficult because those remaining in poverty are harder to reach. Further policy efforts to reduce poverty should not only focus on reducing the number of existing poor but also preventing the non-poor from becoming new poor in the later development process. The present study of poverty dynamics poses important implications for further targeted poverty alleviation practices. First, while it is still necessary to invest in creating opportunities for the poor, development policies should also focus on helping disadvantaged individuals to seize them. Policies on lowering caregiving burden associated with\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 2351 10 of 13\ndisadvantages could greatly enable family members to enjoy the trickle-down developmental opportunities [31]. Second, given that growth-oriented development was incapable of alleviating poverty associated with social marginalization, the role of social security should be further strengthened. Not only its coverage, but also the thresholds for disadvantaged groups should be reconsidered. Poverty alleviation should be closely linked to the development of social policy in China [31,46]. Third, findings on poverty dynamics suggest that the vulnerability of a household should be measured and poverty should be tackled in advance to reduce its intergenerational transmission. It calls for specific policy attentions on interventions to lower the stigma associated with SMI and poverty, allowing the family to build connections with others, develop support networks, and lift the next generation. Mental health issues have long been neglected in China\u2019s health and development policies. While the burden associated with physical illness has been well documented [49], less is known about poverty associated with SMI [19]. This study, together with other studies rooted in the same context [8,21], revealed how SMI had deteriorated poverty for households of persons with SMI within a period of social prosperity. Although there was an increasing policy supply of social security for persons with SMI [50,51], the capability loss still largely hindered these households from the trickle-down effect of external development and kept them in chronic poverty [19,52]. As China has moved into the post-poverty era, formulating intervention plans and policies to target relative poverty associated with SMI may be crucial for achieving China\u2019s new goals of inclusive development and common prosperity."

It was designed based on previous quantitative studies on the same study population [8,21], which may be better than most other independent-designed qualitative studies on its reliability. Nevertheless, there were still some limitations that should be mentioned. First, the research framework was modified based on strong highlights on economic growth, marginalization, and social security. Data collection and analysis were performed in an inductive thematic approach. Other potential significant forces in shaping poverty dynamics may have been neglected in this framework, for example, the development of social charity. Further studies may consider applying grounded theory to build a solid theoretical framework. Second, this study only recruited caregivers of persons with SMI as participants. The perceptions of social development and illness may vary from the patient\u2019s perspective. Both persons with SMI and caregivers should be included in further studies, particularly paying attention to interpreting their different conceptions and opinions. Third, in the recruiting period, caregivers were selected based on their suitability for participating interviews. Therefore, the presented findings may be limited to unveiling the living situation of those being excluded."

In order to capture the complex nature of poverty dynamics, it modified the capability approach, and applied the qualitative method to examine the roles of development, illness, and social security in shaping poverty dynamics. Poverty associated with SMI was unlikely to be alleviated automatically within the process of development. Instead, social isolation and high caregiving burden may aggravate poverty for families of persons with SMI.
