    "abstractText": "In this paper we study three-dimensional orbifolds by 2-groups with a triviallyacting one-form symmetry group BK. These orbifolds have a global two-form symmetry, and so one expects that they decompose into (are equivalent to) a disjoint union of other three-dimensional theories, which we demonstrate. These theories can be interpreted as sigma models on 2-gerbes, whose formal structures reflect properties of the orbifold construction.",

            "text": "Decomposition, the observation that a local quantum field theory is sometimes a disjoint union of other local quantum field theories, has by now been extensively studied since its initial observation in [1] in two-dimensional gauge theories with trivially-acting subgroups, see for example [2\u201326]. A few reviews can be found in [27\u201331]. Although decomposition was originally observed in two dimensional theories, it has also been observed in four-dimensional theories, see for example [7, 8]. The purpose of this paper is to discuss examples in three dimensions, where it has not previously been studied. Globally, decomposition is expected to take place in any theory in d spacetime dimensions with a global (d\u22121)-form symmetry (possibly realized noninvertibly) [7, 8]. One way to produce such a symmetry is via a suitable gauging. In broad brushstrokes, gauging a trivially-acting n-form symmetry results in a theory with a global (n + 1)-form symmetry (distinct from the quantum symmetry), so one can hope to produce a d-dimensional theories with a decomposition by gauging a trivially-acting (d\u2212 2)-form symmetry. For example, ordinary gauge theories with trivially-acting subgroups are a source of examples in two dimensions, as mentioned above, because such theories have a global oneform symmetry (distinct from the quantum symmetry, and tied specifically to the fact that the group acts trivially). In this paper, we study three-dimensional gauge theories with gauged trivially-acting one-form symmetries. Gauging the trivially-acting one-form symmetry leads to a global two-form symmetry, hence, in three dimensions, a decomposition. Specifically, in this paper we describe orbifolds of three-dimensional effective1 field theories by 2-groups, which are extensions of ordinary (here, finite) groups by one-form symmetries. (See for example [32] for a mathematical introduction to 2-groups. These structures have a long history in both math and physics, see for example [33\u201358] for a few older instances, and [59\u201372] for some more recent physics descriptions and applications of 2-groups.) When those one-form symmetries act trivially, gauging them results in a global two-form symmetry, hence a decomposition as above, which we will check explicitly. We begin in section 2 by reviewing two-dimensional orbifolds by central extensions of G by trivially-acting K, and how a decomposition arises in such orbifolds. In particular,\n1We emphasize that because we often discuss orbifolds of three-dimensional sigma models, we understand those sigma models as effective field theories, not necessarily renormalizable theories. Our methods also apply to more general three-dimensional theories, such as, for example, Chern-Simons theories.\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\ndecomposition implements a restriction on nonperturbative sectors. In an orbifold the nonperturbative sectors are the twisted sectors, and in these orbifolds those twisted sectors are restricted to those describing G bundles satisfying a condition. The restriction is implemented physically by a sum over G orbifolds, namely the decomposition, realizing a \u2018multiverse interference effect\u2019 between the constituent G orbifolds (\u2018universes\u2019). An important role in that decomposition is played by discrete torsion, so in section 3 we review three-dimensional analogues of discrete torsion, counted by H3(G,U(1)). In section 4 we turn to the main content of this paper: we define and study orbifolds by 2-group extensions of ordinary (finite) groups G by trivially-acting one-form symmetry groups BK. Just as in two-dimensional cases, the nonperturbative sectors correspond to G bundles satisfying a condition. We argue that, also just as in two-dimensional cases, that restriction implies (and is implemented by) a decomposition of the three-dimensional theory, with universes indexed by irreducible representations of K, which we study explicitly in several examples. In section 5 we interpret this structure formally in terms of a sigma model whose target is a 2-gerbe. In section 6 we outline higher-dimensional analogues and their interpretations. In section 7 we briefly outline analogous decompositions in Chern-Simons theories with gauged one-form symmetry group actions, which will be further addressed in other work to appear. In appendix A, we give mathematically rigorous derivations of statements about bundles of 2-groups. In appendix B we formally discuss decomposition as a duality transform, as a type of Fourier transform. Finally, in appendix C we collect some results on group cohomology that are used in computations in the main text. Higher-dimensional orbifolds by ordinary groups have also been discussed in e.g. [73, 74]. However, so far as we can determine, those papers do not discuss orbifolds by higher groups, and do not discuss decomposition. We believe our observations in this paper (regarding orbifolds by 2-groups and decomposition) are novel."

            "text": "In this section we will review decomposition of two-dimensional orbifolds in which a central subgroup of the orbifold group acts trivially. The fact that such orbifolds are equivalent to (\u2018decompose into\u2019) disjoint unions of other theories was worked out in [1]; however, our presentation of the phenomenon here has not been previously published, and is the prototype for our discussion of decomposition in 2-group orbifolds later. Let X be a space, and G a finite group acting on X. Let \u0393 be a central extension of G by a finite abelian group K:\n1 \u2212\u2192 K \u2212\u2192 \u0393 \u2212\u2192 G \u2212\u2192 1. (2.1)\nSuch extensions are classified by elements of H2(G,K). Briefly, the statement of decomposition here is that [1]\nQFT ([X/\u0393]) = \u2210 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 QFT ( [X/G]\u03c1(\u03c9) ) , (2.2)\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nwhere K\u0302 denotes irreducible representations of K, and \u03c1(\u03c9) \u2208 H2(G,U(1)) is the image \u03c1\u25e6\u03c9 of the extension class \u03c9 under \u03c1 \u2208 K\u0302. (Decomposition is also defined for more general orbifolds [1\u20133], but for our purposes in this paper, the special case of central extensions above will suffice.) Next, we establish this decomposition, by computing partition functions. First, recall that the extension \u0393 can be described set-wise as a product G\u00d7K, with product deformed by an element [\u03c9] \u2208 H2(G,K). Let \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, and write \u0393 set-wise as the product G \u00d7 K, then the product in \u0393 is defined by\n\u03b31\u03b32 = (g1, k1) (g2, k2) = (g1g2, k1k2\u03c9(g1, g2)) . (2.3)\nIn the partition function of a two-dimensional orbifold [X/\u0393] on T 2, we sum over commuting pairs of group elements in \u0393, but clearly the condition for \u03b31 and \u03b32 to commute is equivalent to g1 commuting with g2 and\n\u03c9(g1, g2) \u03c9(g2, g1) = 1. (2.4)\nDefine (g1, g2) =\n\u03c9(g1, g2) \u03c9(g2, g1) , (2.5)\nthen it is straightforward to demonstrate that\n(a, bc) = (a, b) (a, c), (2.6)\n(and symmetrically,) so as a consequence, is invariant under conjugation:2\n(hah\u22121, hbh\u22121) = (hah\u22121, h) (hah\u22121, b) (hah\u22121, h\u22121), = (hah\u22121, b), = (h, b) (a, b) (h\u22121, b), = (a, b). (2.7)\nIn particular, this descends to isomorphism classes of G bundles, which on T 2 are classified by Hom(\u03c01(T 2), G)/G. We can view as assigning a phase to each such bundle. Thus, the partition function of a two-dimensional [X/\u0393] orbifold looks like the partition function of a [X/G] orbifold but with a restriction on the allowed sectors. We can implement that restriction on allowed sectors by inserting an operator\n\u03b4( \u2212 1) = 1 |K| \u2211 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 \u03c1(g1, g2), (2.8)\nwhere \u03c1 is the image of \u03c9(g1, g2)/\u03c9(g2, g1) under \u03c1 : K \u2192 U(1). This is the origin of decomposition [1].\n2We restrict to the same h on each input because is only defined on commuting pairs.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nNow, let us assemble these pieces. The partition function of a \u0393 orbifold on T 2 is, universally,\nZT 2 ([X/\u0393]) = 1 |\u0393| \u2211 \u03b3\u03bb=\u03bb\u03b3 Z(\u03b3, \u03bb), (2.9)\nwhere the sum is over commuting pairs \u03b3, \u03bb \u2208 \u0393, and Z(\u03b3, \u03bb) is the contribution from a square with sides identified by \u03b3, \u03bb \u2014 known as the twisted sectors or partial traces. In the present circumstances, since K \u2282 \u0393 acts trivially,\nZ(\u03b3, \u03bb) = Z(g, h) (2.10)\nwhere g = \u03c0(\u03b3), h = \u03c0(\u03bb), for \u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 G the projection. Taking this into account, we then have\nZT 2 ([X/\u0393]) = |K|2 |\u0393| \u2211\ngh=hg, =1 Z(g, h),\n= |K| 2 |\u0393| |G| |K| \u2211 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 ZT 2 ( [X/G]\u03c1(\u03c9) ) ,\n= \u2211 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 ZT 2 ( [X/G]\u03c1(\u03c9) ) , (2.11)\nwhere ZT 2 ( [X/G]\u03c1(\u03c9) ) = 1 |G| \u2211 gh=hg \u03c1(g, h)Z(g, h) (2.12)\nis the partition function of the G orbifold on T 2 with discrete torsion \u03c1(\u03c9) \u2208 H2(G,U(1)). Thus, we see that partition functions are consistent with the prediction of decomposition (2.2). In passing, note that in the case G = Z2 = K, H2(G,K) = Z2 (and hence has nontrivial elements), but for all [\u03c9] \u2208 H2(G,K), and all commuting pairs,\n\u03c9(g1, g2) \u03c9(g2, g1) = 1. (2.13)\nThus, triviality of the ratio of cocycles can happen even if \u03c9 is a nontrivial cohomology class. Our analysis above was specific to the case that the worldsheet is T 2, but it generalizes easily to other genus. Before considering general genus, let us next walk through the case of genus 2. Let \u03b3i = (ai, ki) \u2208 \u0393, \u03bbi = (bi, zi) \u2208 \u0393, i \u2208 {1, 2}, obeying the condition\n[\u03b31, \u03bb1] [\u03b32, \u03bb2] = 1, (2.14)\nfor [g, h] = ghg\u22121h\u22121, (2.15)\nand define \u03be1 = [a1, b1] = a1b1a\u221211 b\u221211 . (2.16)\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nThen, using the fact that\n\u03b3\u22121i = ( a\u22121i , k \u22121 i \u03c9(ai, a\u22121i )\u22121 ) , \u03bb\u22121i = ( b\u22121i , z \u22121 i \u03c9(bi, b\u22121i )\u22121 ) , (2.17)\nit is straightforward to compute that\n[\u03b31, \u03bb1] = ( [a1, b1], \u03c9(a1, b1)\u03c9(a1b1, a\u221211 )\u03c9(a1b1a\u221211 , b\u221211 )\n\u00b7\u03c9(a1, a\u221211 )\u22121 \u03c9(b1, b\u221211 )\u22121 ) , (2.18)\n[\u03b31, \u03bb1] [\u03b32, \u03bb2] = ( [a1, b1][a2, b2], \u03c9(a1, b1)\u03c9(a1b1, a\u221211 )\u03c9(a1b1a\u221211 , b\u221211 )\n\u00b7\u03c9(\u03be1, a2)\u03c9(\u03be1a2, b2)\u03c9(\u03be1a2b2, a\u221212 ) \u00b7\u03c9(\u03be1a2b2a\u221212 , b\u221212 ) \u00b7\u03c9(a1, a\u221211 )\u22121 \u03c9(a2, a\u221212 )\u22121\n\u00b7\u03c9(b1, b\u221211 )\u22121 \u03c9(b2, b\u221212 )\u22121 ) , (2.19)\nso we see that the closure condition (2.14) holds if and only if both\n[a1, b1] [a2, b2] = 1 (2.20)\nand\n1 = \u03c9(a1, b1)\u03c9(a1b1, a\u221211 )\u03c9(a1b1a\u221211 , b\u221211 ) \u00b7\u03c9(\u03be1, a2)\u03c9(\u03be1a2, b2)\u03c9(\u03be1a2b2, a\u221212 )\u03c9(\u03be1a2b2a\u221212 , b\u221212 ) \u00b7\u03c9(a1, a\u221211 )\u22121 \u03c9(a2, a\u221212 )\u22121 \u03c9(b1, b\u221211 )\u22121 \u03c9(b2, b\u221212 )\u22121. (2.21)\nNext, we generalize to arbitrary genus. Consider a Riemann surface of genus g, with boundary conditions determined by \u03b3i = (ai, ki) \u2208 \u0393, \u03bbi = (bi, zi) \u2208 \u0393, i \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , g}. Define \u03bei = [ai, bi], and\nX = [\u220f i \u03c9(ai, a\u22121i ) \u220f i \u03c9(bi, b\u22121i ) ]\u22121 . (2.22)\nThe condition that the group elements must obey to define boundary conditions on the Riemann surface is that\n[\u03b31, \u03bb1] [\u03b32, \u03bb2] \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 [\u03b3g, \u03bbg] = 1, (2.23)\nwhich implies that [a1, b1] [a2, b2] \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 [ag, bg] = 1 (2.24)\n(which are required for ai, bi \u2208 G to close on the Riemann surface) as well as\n(ai, bi) = 1 (2.25)\nfor\n(ai, bi) \u2261 X\u03c9(a1, b1)\u03c9(a1b1, a\u221211 )\u03c9(a1b1a\u221211 , b\u221211 )\u03c9(\u03be1, a2)\u03c9(\u03be1a2, b2)\u03c9(\u03be1a2b2, a\u221212 ) \u00b7\u03c9(\u03be1a2b2a\u221212 , b\u221212 )\u03c9(\u03be1\u03be2, a3) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\u03c9(\u03be1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03beg\u22121agbga\u22121g , b\u22121g ).\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\n(This can be obtained either by direct multiplication or by triangulating the Riemann surface into simplices and associating a factor of \u03c9 with each simplex, as in [75].) Thus, as before, the data required to define a \u0393 orbifold on a genus g Riemann surface is a restriction on the combinatorial data used to define a G orbifold on the same Riemann surface, a restriction of the form (ai, bi) = 1. As for T 2, we can implement that restriction by inserting a projection operator \u03a0, of the same form as before, with \u03c1 that are the image of the genus-g under an irreducible representation \u03c1. The resulting phases are the same as the phases defining discrete torsion on a genus g Riemann surface (see ([75], eq. (15)), [76]), again for discrete torsion given by the image of H2(G,K) under the irreducible representation \u03c1 : K \u2192 U(1). Thus, we see the story for T 2 generalizes immediately to other Riemann surfaces. For later use, we note that the discrete torsion here can equivalently be understood as a coupling to a discrete theta angle, defined by a characteristic class x\u2217\u03c9, for x : \u03a3\u2192 BG a map defining the twisted sector, in the notation of appendix A. One can rewrite such a discrete theta angle coupling \u222b\n\u03a3 \u3008\u03c1, x\u2217\u03c9\u3009 (2.26)\nas a discrete torsion phase by triangulating the Riemann surface \u03a3 and associating phases to each simplex as reviewed above and in [75, 77]. So far we have considered central extensions. Decomposition also exists for orbifolds by non-central extensions, see e.g. [1, 2]; however, its form is more complex. In this paper we focus on (analogues of) central extensions."

Such analogues of discrete torsion were studied in [77] in the special case of orbifolds of points (forming Dijkgraaf-Witten theory), and more generally in [78].

Similarly, in three dimensions [77, 78], the analogue of discrete torsion in a G orbifold is classified by H3(G,U(1)), again with a trivial action on the coefficients. Furthermore, given [\u03c9] \u2208 H2(G,U(1)), one can derive coboundary-invariant phases that weight Riemann surfaces. For example, on T 2, a twisted sector is defined by two commuting elements g, h \u2208 G, and the corresponding coboundary-invariant phase is\n\u03c9(g, h) \u03c9(h, g) .

One construction [77] proceeds as follows. given a three-manifold Y , we pick a triangulation by simplices, and associate to each simplex a cocycle. We then take an alternating product of those associated cocycles (with exponent determined by orientation) to form a coboundary-invariant phase. For example, the triangulation of a cube into six simplices can be visualized by viewing the cube along a line through two corners, as\nand then taking the tetrahedra cut out by the six interior lines projected through the cube in the figure above. See also [78] for an alternative construction in terms of C field holonomlies. For example, on T 3, a twisted sector is defined by three commuting group elements g1, g2, g3,\ng1\ng3\ng2\nand here one multiplies Z(g1, g2, g3) by the phase ([77], eq.

In passing, a general expression for S1 reduction of such phases is discussed in ([79], supplementary section), ([80], section V). In two dimensions, discrete torsion phases obey multiloop factorization (target space unitarity), which is the following constraint. If \u03a3 is any Riemann surface, corresponding to a twisted sector of some orbifold, and \u03a3 can degenerate into a product of \u03a31 and \u03a32\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nconnected at one point (compatibly with the orbifold structure, in the sense that there are no twist fields at the connection), then the phase associated to \u03a3 must equal the product of the phases associated to \u03a31 and \u03a32.\nIn two dimensions, for the genus-one phase\n2(g, h) = \u03c9(g, h) \u03c9(h, g) , (3.10)\nthis is the property ([81], eq. (42))\n2(x, ab) = 2(x, a) 2(x, b), (3.11)\nwhich can be demonstrated simply using\n(d\u03c9)(x, a, b) (d\u03c9)(a, b, x) (d\u03c9)(a, x, b) = 2(x, ab) 2(x, a) 2(x, b)\n(3.12)\nfor x, a, b all mutually commuting. When combined with the fact that 2(1,\u2212) = 2(\u2212, 1) = 1, we see this means that 2 is a bihomomorphism from commuting pairs in G to U(1). In three dimensions, there is a simple analogue of multiloop factorization: if a threemanifold S1 \u00d7 \u03a3 can degenerate into S1 \u00d7 (\u03a31\n\u2210\u03a32), the phase assigned to S1 \u00d7 \u03a3 must match the product of the phases assigned to S1\u00d7\u03a31, S1\u00d7\u03a32. On such grounds, one then expects\n3(x, y, ab) = 3(x, y, a) 3(x, y, b). (3.13)\nIn fact, it is straightforward to check that this is a consequence of the identity\n(d\u03c9)(y, x, a, b) (d\u03c9)(x, y, a, b) (d\u03c9)(a, b, y, x) (d\u03c9)(a, b, x, y) (d\u03c9)(y, a, b, x) (d\u03c9)(x, a, b, y) (d\u03c9)(x, a, y, b) (d\u03c9)(y, a, x, b) (d\u03c9)(a, x, b, y) (d\u03c9)(a, y, b, x) (d\u03c9)(a, y, x, b) (d\u03c9)(a, x, y, b)\n= 1. (3.14)\n(See also ([77], section 6), where a different argument is given for the same result.) One can use multiloop factorization to argue that discrete torsion(-like) phases descend to conjugacy classes. For example, in the case of the genus-one phase 2, from (3.11), it is easy to show that3\n2(aga\u22121, aha\u22121) = 2(aga\u22121, a) 2(aga\u22121, h) 2(aga\u22121, a\u22121) = 2(aga\u22121, h), = 2(a, h) 2(g, h) 2(a\u22121, h), = 2(g, h). (3.16)\nComputing in exactly the same fashion, one can use (3.13) to show that\n3(aga\u22121, aha\u22121, aka\u22121) = 3(g, h, k). (3.17) 3In fact, formally both this expression and its three-dimensional analogue appear to generalize to inde-\npendent conjugation on the parameters, as\n2(aga\u22121, bhb\u22121) = 2(g, h). (3.15)\nHowever, 2(g, h) is only defined for commuting g, h, so we restrict to the case a = b. Identical remarks apply to 3.\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6"

            "text": "For completeness, let us also quickly outline the case of manifolds with boundary, that will be of use in our subsequent works. Let\u2019s begin with an overview of how this works in two-dimensional theories and ordinary discrete torsion, before describing an example in three dimensions. Consider a genus-one correlation function in an orbifold [X/G] with a single insertion of an operator associated to g \u2208 G. In effect, we have a T 2 with a puncture corresponding to g. If we let a, b \u2208 G denote group elements corresponding to the usual T 2 boundary conditions, then we can sketch the construction of the punctured torus as in the diagram below:\na\nb b\na g\nwith a hole cut out in the upper right corner, or equivalently,\na\nb b\na\nx\nax\nbx\nabx\nbax g\nIn the presence of the puncture, a and b no longer commute, but instead obey\nabg = ba. (3.18)\nAlternatively, we can say that if \u03a3 is a punctured T 2, then to specify an element of Hom(\u03c01(\u03a3), G) we can first assign a group element g to the loop circling the puncture, and then the group elements a and b assigned to the non-contractible cycles of the torus will need to satisfy (3.18), since the cycle associated to a\u22121b\u22121ab is homotopic to the cycle circling the puncture. Then bundles on \u03a3 are classified by Hom(\u03c01(\u03a3), G)/G, as usual. One more perspective comes from consideration of topological defect lines. The a and b twists on the T 2 are implemented by wrapping a and b lines around the cycles. Saying that our inserted operator is associated to g is equivalent to saying that it sits at the end of a defect line labeled by g. The other end of that line must terminate somewhere on the first two defect lines. The simplest possibility is to connect everything at a single junction of degree five. In order for that junction to remain topological (i.e. to avoid an extra nontopological insertion), we need the cyclic product of lines coming in to give the identity, which again leads to (3.18). In any event, the discrete torsion phase assigned to a punctured T 2 is not the same as that assigned to T 2 itself \u2014 the contribution to the boundary conditions from the\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\npuncture modifies the phase. Applying methods of [75], we see that the phase associated to this diagram is\n\u03be1,1 \u2261 \u03c9(a, b) \u03c9(b, a) \u03c9(ab, g). (3.19)\nNow, if we add a coboundary \u03b1, this phase changes:\n\u03be1,1 7\u2192 \u03be1,1 \u03b1(g). (3.20)\nThis is not quite invariant under coboundaries; however, the coboundary \u03b1(g) can be absorbed into the operator at the puncture, so taking that into account, the phase is welldefined. Proceeding in this fashion, one is led to correlation functions, see e.g. [82] for examples in the case of orbifolds of a point (Dijkgraaf-Witten theory). Now, let us turn to three-dimensional analogues. We consider a T 3 with a hole, of boundary T 2. If we let the three primary sides be related by g1, g2, g3, and the new edge defining the hole by k, then graphically,\ng1\ng3\ng2\nk\nThe cut-out corner, seen edge-on, is the square\ng3\nk k\ng3\nx\ng3x\nkx\ng3kx = kg3x\nIn order for the diagram to close, the four group elements g1, g2, g3, k \u2208 G obey\ng1g3 = g3g1, g2g3 = g3g2, g1g2k = g2g1, g3k = kg3. (3.21)\nApplying the same methods as [78], we find that the phase factor associated with this diagram is\n\u03c9(g1, g2, g3) \u03c9(g2, g1, g3) \u03c9(g3, g1, g2) \u03c9(g1, g3, g2) \u03c9(g2, g3, g1) \u03c9(g3, g2, g1) \u03c9(g1g2, k, g3)\u03c9(g3, g1g2, k) \u03c9(g1g2, g3, k) .

We interpret this as before, as a contribution that would be absorbed by a defect inserted at the puncture, precisely in the spirit of anomaly inflow (see e.g. [83]). It is also extremely reminiscent of the relationship between three-dimensional Chern-Simons theories and WZW models on boundaries, see e.g. [84].\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6"

In this section we will restrict to the analogue of a central extension, for which the map \u03b1 is trivial, and for which H3(G,K) is defined with trivial action on the coefficients.\nWe will describe 2-groups as extensions of the form\n1 \u2212\u2192 BK \u2212\u2192 \u0393\u0303 \u2212\u2192 G \u2212\u2192 1, (4.1)\nfor finite abelian K.

(1.10), (1.14)), implementing a Green-Schwarz mechanism, in which case one would not have for example precisely a path integral over ordinary K gerbes, but rather over slightly different objects forming a torsor under K gerbes.) Examples in which the K gerbe acts nontrivially (via the action of BK on line operators, for example) include the gauging that arose in [13], and also in discussions of gauging BK in Chern-Simons theories for K the center of the gauge group. In this paper, we will be focused on the case in which the one-form symmetry group being gauged acts completely trivially on the three-dimensional theory, meaning that line operators are invariant5 under BK, meaning for example that associated line operators have no braiding with one another or with any of the line operators in the theory being gauged. In this case, relevant for us in this paper, we will see that gauging a 2-group \u0393\u0303 means that the path integral (modulo mutual twistings subtleties as above),\n\u2022 sums over K gerbes, and for each K gerbe,\n\u2022 sums over ordinary G bundles \u2014 no longer twisted by K, as BK now acts trivially, but with a more subtle restriction on allowed G bundles, a shadow of the fact that we are gauging a nontrivial extension of G by BK.\n5For example, consider SU(2) Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions. This has a BZ2 one-form symmetry, inherited from the center of SU(2). However, that one-form symmetry multiplies Wilson lines by phases, and so we would not characterize SU(2) Chern-Simons as invariant under this BZ2. One could in principle consider a different BZ2, unrelated to the central Z2, which leaves all Wilson lines invariant.

(4.8)\nWe have that on a connected three-manifold M ,\nZM ( [X/\u0393\u0303] ) = \u2211 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 ZM ( [X/G]\u03c1(\u03c9) ) , (4.9)\nmatching the prediction of decomposition 4.3, with the sum over universes implementing the restriction to G bundles such that x\u2217\u03c9 = 1. Next, we specialize to the case of M = T 3. As everything can be computed explicitly in this case, we will walk through all the details in order to better explain the idea. Ordinarily, in a G orbifold on T 3, one would sum over commuting triples g1, g2, g3 \u2208 G. Here, however, because of the 2-group extension, only some triples are consistent, much as we saw in the case of ordinary central extensions in section 2. As mentioned above, and as described in detail in appendix A.2, the constraint on G bundles is that x\u2217\u03c9 = 1 \u2208 H3(T 3,K).\n6Our notations differ, but the procedure is identical. Specifically, the \u03b3 : M \u2192 BG used in [77] is the same as x : M \u2192 BG here, and the \u03b1 \u2208 H3(G,U(1)) used there coincides with \u03c9 \u2208 H3(G,K) here. Their analysis is done for U(1) coefficients, but essentially because K is abelian and in both cases, the group action on the coefficients is trivial, the argument is otherwise the same.\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nTo understand the result, we outline here a slightly sloppy computation for the special case of T 3, which will reproduce the T 3 result derived rigorously in appendix A.3. To make the 2-group \u0393\u0303 more concrete, we imagine associating K-valued wavefunctions \u03c8g to g \u2208 G, which can then be multiplied by K-valued cocycles, where associativity holds up to the cocycle \u03c9 as\n\u03c8g1g2\u03c8g3 = \u03c9(g1, g2, g3)\u03c8g1\u03c8g2g3 . (4.10)\n(Note that adding coboundaries to \u03c9 merely multiplies the products by phases.) Then, we can derive a consistency condition on commuting triples, as follows.\n\u03c8g1g2\u03c8g3 = \u03c8g2g1\u03c8g3 , = \u03c9(g2, g1, g3)\u03c8g2\u03c8g1g3 , = \u03c9(g2, g1, g3)\u03c8g2\u03c8g3g1 ,\n= \u03c9(g2, g1, g3) \u03c9(g2, g3, g1) \u03c8g2g3\u03c8g1 , = \u03c9(g2, g1, g3) \u03c9(g2, g3, g1) \u03c8g3g2\u03c8g1 . (4.11)\nIt also equals\n\u03c8g1g2\u03c8g3 = \u03c9(g1, g2, g3)\u03c8g1\u03c8g2g3 , = \u03c9(g1, g2, g3)\u03c8g1\u03c8g3g2 ,\n= \u03c9(g1, g2, g3) \u03c9(g1, g3, g2) \u03c8g1g3\u03c8g2 , = \u03c9(g1, g2, g3) \u03c9(g1, g3, g2) \u03c8g3g1\u03c8g2 , = \u03c9(g1, g2, g3) \u03c9(g1, g3, g2) \u03c9(g3, g1, g2)\u03c8g3\u03c8g1g2 , = \u03c9(g1, g2, g3) \u03c9(g1, g3, g2) \u03c9(g3, g1, g2)\u03c8g3\u03c8g2g1 , = \u03c9(g1, g2, g3) \u03c9(g1, g3, g2) \u03c9(g3, g1, g2) \u03c9(g3, g2, g1) \u03c8g3g2\u03c8g1 . (4.12)\nIn order for these two expressions to match, we must require\n\u03c9(g1, g2, g3) \u03c9(g1, g3, g2) \u03c9(g3, g1, g2) \u03c9(g3, g2, g1) \u03c9(g2, g3, g1) \u03c9(g2, g1, g3) = 1 (4.13)\nas an element of K, which is the same condition derived mathematically in appendix A.3. (We suspect it may also be possible to use topological defect lines to give a simple argument, but we leave that for future work.) We can therefore understand a \u0393\u0303 bundle as a collection of K gerbes and G bundles on T 3 defined by commuting triples (g1, g2, g3) subject to the constraint\n(g1, g2, g3) = 1 (4.14)\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nfor (g1, g2, g3) =\n\u03c9(g1, g2, g3) \u03c9(g1, g3, g2) \u03c9(g3, g1, g2) \u03c9(g3, g2, g1) \u03c9(g2, g3, g1) \u03c9(g2, g1, g3) . (4.15)\nFor the same reasons as discussed for H3(G,U(1)) in section 3, it is straightforward to demonstrate that\n(g1, g2, g3g4) = (g1, g2, g3) (g1, g2, g4) (4.16)\n(and symmetrically), hence using the same argument as in the two-dimensional case, is invariant under simultaneous conjugation,7\n(hg1h\u22121, hg2h\u22121, hg3h\u22121) = (g1, g2, g3). (4.17)\nThe partition function of the \u0393\u0303 orbifold on T 3 then takes the form8 [87]\nZT 3 ( [X/\u0393\u0303] ) = |H\n0(T 3,K)| |H1(T 3,K)| 1 |H0(T 3, G)| \u2211 z1,z2,z3\u2208K \u2211 g1,g2,g3\u2208G \u2032 Z(g1, g2, g3),\n= 1 |K|2|G| \u2211 z1,z2,z3\u2208K \u2211 g1,g2,g3\u2208G \u2032 Z(g1, g2, g3), (4.18)\nwhere the prime indicates that the sum over triples in G is constrained to commuting triples such that (g1, g2, g3) = 1.\nNow, we can enforce the condition that = 1 by inserting a projector\n1 |K| \u2211 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 \u03c1(g1, g2, g3) (4.19)\nwhere \u03c1 is the image of under \u03c1 : K \u2192 U(1). The partition function then has the form\nZT 3 ( [X/\u0393\u0303] ) = 1 |K|2|G| |K|3 \u2211\ng1,g2,g3\u2208G\n1 |K| \u2211 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 \u03c1(g1, g2, g3)Z(g1, g2, g3),\n= \u2211 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 ZT 3 ( [X/G] \u03c1) ) , (4.20)\nwhere ZT 3 ( [X/G] \u03c1) ) = 1 |G| \u2211 g1,g2,g3\u2208G \u03c1(g1, g2, g3)Z(g1, g2, g3), (4.21)\nusing a standard normalization (compare e.g. ([73], eq. (5.14))). Each factor \u03c1 is precisely a C field analogue of discrete torsion, as reviewed in section 3, and coincides with the quantity we earlier labelled \u03c1(\u03c9). Thus, we see that for the special case of T 3, partition functions are consistent with the decomposition conjecture 4.3. As outlined at the beginning, the same argument applies for\n7We restrict to the same h on each factor because is only defined on commuting triples, meaning each pair obeys gigj = gjgi.\n8The overall factor of 1/|G| is standard in orbifolds and ultimately reflects the fact that the sum is counting bundles with automorphisms, see e.g. ([73], eq. (5.14)). The factors involving K can be found in e.g. ([38], eq. (5.20)), ([88], eqs. (2.31), (2.32)) ([89], eq. (9.1)).\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nany three-manifold. The only real difference on other three-manifolds is that there may be dilaton-type Euler counterterm shifts, as discussed in e.g. [1], which vanish on T 3 as \u03c7(T 3) = 0. Modulo such trivial counterterms, on any connected three-manifold,\nZ ( [X/\u0393\u0303] ) = \u2211 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 Z ( [X/G] \u03c1 ) . (4.22)\nThis is precisely the statement of decomposition (4.3), at the level of partition functions. To summarize, we see that inserting a projection operator to enforce the constraint on G-twisted sectors makes manifest the statement that the partition function of the 2- group orbifolds equals the partition function for a sum of three-dimensional orbifolds, each twisted by an \u03c1 which is [78] a three-dimensional analogue of discrete torsion. In this fashion, we recover decomposition (4.3), at the level of partition functions, in close analogy with the description in section 2 of decomposition in two-dimensional orbifolds.\nAs an aside, previously in two-dimensional theories with a one-form symmetry given by a trivially-acting K, we saw universes enumerated by irreducible representations of K, see e.g. [1]. Here, since we have a 2-form symmetry and trivially-acting BK, one might have naively guessed that universes would be enumerated by representations of BK, at variance with the conjecture above. However, we examine decomposition for both 1-form and 2- form symmetries formally in appendix B, and observe there that in both cases, universes appear to be enumerated by representations of K, so the form of the conjecture above is consistent."

Let us briefly outline an analogous argument using local operators. In two dimensional orbifolds with trivially-acting subgroups, the twist fields associated to trivially-acting group elements form dimension-zero operators, and the projectors (onto universes) are constructed from linear combinations of those projectors. In three dimensions, when gauging a one-form symmetry, from the general theory of topological defect lines, the theory contains monopole operators, which play an analogous role. Briefly, the monopole operators are endpoints of real codimension two lines corresponding to the gauged one-form symmetry, just as gauging an ordinary (zero-form) symmetry results in real codimension one walls. Two-spheres surrounding the monopole operators have K gerbes, just as circles surrounding two-dimensional twist fields carry bundles.\nIn any event, given a trivially-acting gauged BK symmetry, the resulting threedimensional theory will contain monopole operators, which are closely analogous to twodimensional twist fields, and can be used to build projectors.\nFor example, in a gauged BZk, the monopole operators will generate Zk gerbes on S2, which are classified by H2(S2,Zk) = Zk. As those gerbes on S2 are all generated by powers of one gerbe, there will be one monopole operator which generates the others, call it z\u0302, and which obeys z\u0302k = 1.

A n-(G-)gerbe is essentially a fiber bundle whose fibers are \u2018groups\u2019 BnG of higher-form symmetries. As a result, a sensibly-defined sigma model with target such a gerbe should admit a global BnG symmetry, corresponding to translations along the fibers of the gerbe.\nBecause the \u2018group\u2019 BG = [point/G], a G-gerbe \u2014 a fiber bundle with fiber BG \u2014 can be locally presented as a quotient in which a subgroup acts trivially. This was utilized in the previous work [90\u201392] to construct sigma models on gerbes, presented as orbifolds and gauge theories with trivially-acting subgroups.\nNow, this glosses over a number of subtleties, including questions about non-uniqueness of presentations (dealt with by identifying a sigma model on a stack or gerbe with a universality class of RG flow), potential modular invariance and unitarity issues in orbifolds, seeming moduli mismatches, and most important for decomposition, violations of the cluster decomposition axiom, which were discussed in [1, 90\u201392].\nIn any event, from the same reasoning, orbifolds by 2-groups with trivially-acting oneform symmetries appear to be presentations of sigma models on 2-gerbes, just as sigma models on ordinary gerbes are realized in terms of gauge theories with trivially-acting (ordinary) subgroups [90\u201392].\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nAs discussed in ([22], section 2), a map f : Y \u2192 G, for G a (banded) G-gerbe over M (G assumed finite), defines9 a map f\u0303 : Y \u2192 M with a trivialization of f\u0303\u2217G. If dim Y = 2, this gives a restriction on the degree of f\u0303 . Explicitly, let \u03c0 : G \u2192 M be projection, then f\u0303 = \u03c0 \u25e6 f , and f\u0303\u2217G has a canonical trivialization. This trivialization may be clearer to the reader in the closely related case of bundles. Given a map g : Y \u2192 E for some bundle \u03c0 : E \u2192M , we can define g\u0303 = \u03c0\u2217g, and then as\ng\u0303\u2217E = {(y, e) \u2208 Y \u00d7 E | g\u0303(y) = \u03c0(e)}, (5.1)\nthere is a trivialization Y \u2192 g\u0303\u2217E given by y 7\u2192 (y, g\u0303(y)). The same analysis applies to gerbes. So, we have that a map f : Y \u2192 G defines a map f\u0303 : Y \u2192 M such that f\u0303\u2217G is trivializable. As discussed in ([22], section 2), if dim Y = 2, this implies a restriction on degrees. If the characteristic class of G is \u03c9 \u2208 H2(M,G) (G finite), then f\u0303\u2217\u03c9 = 0 \u2208 H2(Y,G). For example, if Y = P1 and M = PN , with f\u0303 : P1 \u2192 PN of degree d, and G = Zk, then f\u0303\u2217\u03c9 = d\u03c9, and d\u03c9 = 0 \u2208 H2(PN ,Zk) means d\u03c9 \u2261 0 mod k, that the product of d and the characteristic class is divisible by k. If the dimension of Y is not two, then one still has a constraint that f\u0303\u2217G is trivializable, which does restrict the possible maps f\u0303 ; however, that restriction will not be describable as simply as a restriction on map degrees. Briefly, the same formal arguments apply to (banded analogues of) 2-gerbes. Just as for ordinary gerbes, a map f : Y \u2192 G, for G a 2-(G-)gerbe over M , from essentially the same argument as before, one gets a map f\u0303 : Y \u2192 M with a restriction on degrees, following from the statement that f\u0303\u2217G is trivializable (and so has vanishing characteristic class in H3(Y,G))."

In the special case of T d, the restriction above to d-tuples obeying (6.2) is equivalent to inserting a projection operator in an ordinary [X/G] orbifold, with projector which on T d takes the form 1\n|K| \u2211 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 \u03c1(g1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , gd), (6.6)\nwhere \u03c1 \u2208 U(1) is the image of under \u03c1 : K \u2192 U(1). The resulting T d partition function is the same as that of a sum of partition functions of [X/G] orbifolds, each with a discrete-torsion-like phase factor defined by \u03c1. Thus, in higher dimensions, based on the partition function analysis above, we expect that the [X/\u0393\u0303] orbifold decomposes:\nQFT ( [X/\u0393\u0303] ) = QFT \u2210 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 [X/G]\u03c1(\u03c9)  , (6.7) (for \u03c1(\u03c9) indicating a discrete theta angle \u03c1 coupled to x\u2217\u03c9,) which at least in special cases can be expressed in the form\nQFT ( [X/\u0393\u0303] ) = QFT \u2210 \u03c1\u2208K\u0302 [X/G]\u03c1(C)  , (6.8)\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nfor \u03c1(C) expressing elements of higher-dimensional analogues of discrete torsion. (Interpreted literally as a sigma model, this theory should only be understood as a lowenergy effective action, of course, though this should also be a prototype for theories in d dimensions.) It is also straightforward to outline the origin of projectors in this language. In two dimensional orbifolds, the projectors onto the universes are constructed as linear combinations of the twist fields associated to trivially-acting group elements. Now, in a d dimensional theory, if we gauge a p-form symmetry, then in the language of topological defect lines (see e.g. [93]), one gets a real codimension (p + 1) object that generalizes the branch cuts of an orbifold, and which terminates on a real codimension (p + 2) object, which is the analogue of a twist field. So, work in d dimensions, and gauge a (trivially-acting) (d \u2212 2)-form symmetry. In principle, this should result in a theory with a global (d\u2212 1)-form symmetry, and hence a decomposition. Because we have gauged a (d\u22122)-form symmetry, we get a real codimension (d\u2212 1) object, an analogue of the two-dimensional branch cut, which terminates at a real codimension d object (an analogue of a twist field), which in d dimensions is pointlike. Those pointlike objects, those analogues of twist fields, could then be used to construct projectors."

            "text": "It is well-known that gauging the BZ2 central symmetry of SU(2) Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions results in an SO(3) Chern-Simons theory. Briefly, the path integral sums over Z2 gerbes and gerbe-twisted SU(2) bundles with connection, for which bundle transition functions only close up to gerbe transition functions on triple overlaps; the resulting path integral is precisely a path integral over SO(3) bundles with connection, for which the second Stiefel-Whitney class w2 coincides with the gerbe characteristic class, and the third Stiefel-Whitney class is determined by a Steenrod square as w3 = Sq1(w2). In that case, the BZ2 acted nontrivially on line operators, specifically as phases determined by the n-ality of the representation (partially) defining the Wilson line. We could consider more general situations, in which the one-form symmetry group maps to an action on the center, but with a nonzero kernel. In general, consider a 2-group \u0393 defined by a crossed module {d : A \u2192 H}, where A is abelian and the image of d is contained within the center of the group H.

            "text": "In this section we will give more rigorous justifications of statements appearing in the main text that various \u0393 bundles project to G bundles obeying a restriction, utilizing homotopy theory. We first describe such restrictions in the case of ordinary central extensions, as a warm-up exercise for the reader, then turn to 2-group extensions.\nA.1 Classification of bundles for central extensions\nLet \u03c9 \u2208 H2(G,K), for G and K finite groups and K abelian, and associate a central extension \u0393:\n1 \u2212\u2192 K \u2212\u2192 \u0393 \u2212\u2192 G \u2212\u2192 1. (A.1)\nWe want to understand \u0393 bundles, which is to say, Map(M,B\u0393). Now, from the surjective map in the central extension, there is a map B\u0393\u2192 BG. Furthermore, since \u0393 is a central extension of G by K, \u0393\u2192 G is a principal K bundle, hence classified by a map G\u2192 BK, meaning that \u0393 is the fiber product\n\u0393 // point\nG // BK\n(A.2)\nTaking B, we get the fiber product\nB\u0393 // point\nBG \u03c9 // K(K, 2)\n(A.3)\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nPut another way, if we apply the functor B(\u2212) to the short exact sequence (A.1) we get that B\u0393 \u2192 BG is a BK principal bundle, and so classified by a map BG \u2192 B2K = K(K, 2), which gives the diagram above. In passing, if K is abelian but not central, then the G action on K gives a twisted form of K, a sheaf of groups K \u2192 BG which is locally isomorphic to K \u00d7 BG. The extension class \u03c9 is then an element of H2(BG,K) (instead of H2(BG,K)), equivalently a section of \u0393(BG,K(K, 2)). In this case, B\u0393 is the homotopy intersection of this section and the zero section of K(K, 2).\nReturning to central extensions, one has the diagram\nMap(M,B\u0393) // Map(M, point) = point\nMap(M,BG) // Map(M,K(K, 2)) = H2(M,K),\n(A.4)\nwhere the bottom map sends x \u2208 Map(M,BG) 7\u2192 x\u2217\u03c9. An element x \u2208 Map(M,BG) will be in the image of an element of Map(M,B\u0393) precisely when x\u2217\u03c9 = 1 \u2208 H2(M,K). We will examine the implications of this on tori in section A.3. It may be helpful to observe that x\u2217\u03c9 can also be understood as the image of the isomorphism class of the G bundle in H1(M,G) under the Bockstein homomorphism\nH1(M,G) \u2212\u2192 H2(M,K). (A.5)\nIf we momentarily drop the assumption that G be finite, then for G = SO(n), \u0393 = Spin(n), the quantity we label x\u2217\u03c9 would coincide with the second Stiefel-Whitney class of the G bundle.\nA.2 Classification of 2-group bundles\nNow, let us repeat that analysis for bundles of 2-groups constructed analogously as extensions. Let \u03c9 \u2208 H3(G,K) = H3(BG,K). Associated to this is a 2-group, which we describe as a crossed module \u0393\u2022,\n\u0393\u2022 = {\u03931 d\u2212\u2192 \u03930}, (A.6)\nwhich sits in the sequence\n1 \u2212\u2192 K \u2212\u2192 \u03931 d\u2212\u2192 \u03930 \u2212\u2192 G \u2212\u2192 1. (A.7)\nThe classifying 2-stack B\u0393\u00b7 is connected, with homotopy groups\n\u03c00(B\u0393\u2022) = 0, \u03c01(B\u0393\u2022) = G, \u03c02(B\u0393\u2022) = K. (A.8)\nLet M be a compact oriented manifold. We want to understand Map(M,B\u0393\u2022). To that end, note that there is a map\nB\u0393\u2022 \u2212\u2192 BG, (A.9)\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\narising as the first stage of the Postnikov tower of B\u0393\u2022, and in fact B\u0393\u2022 is a fiber square\nB\u0393\u2022 // point\nBG \u03c9 // K(K, 3),\n(A.10)\n(from the definition of B\u0393\u2022 as a homotopy type). In the bottom map, we interpret \u03c9 \u2208 H3(G,K) by writing\nH3(G,K) = H3(BG,K) = Map (BG,K(K, 3)) . (A.11)\nFrom the fiber square above, we derive the square\nMap(M,B\u0393\u2022) // Map(M, point) = point\nMap(M,BG) // Map(M,K(K, 3)) = H3(M,K).\n(A.12)\nwhich constrains possible maps (hence possible G bundles on M). Note that since\n\u03c9 \u2208 H3(G,K) = H3(BG,K) = Map (BG,K(K, 3)) , (A.13)\nwe see x\u2217\u03c9 \u2208 Map(M,K(K, 3)) = H3(M,K), so the restriction above is that x\u2217\u03c9 is trivial as an element of H3(M,K):\nx\u2217\u03c9 = 1. (A.14)\nWe will examine the implications of this on tori in section A.3. Furthermore, the fiber in Map(M,B\u0393\u2022) over such as x is just the fiber of the Postnikov tower, namely Map(M,K(K, 2)) = H2(M,K). (A.15)\nThus, fibered over every G bundle are the K gerbes, much as one would expect physically when gauging a 2-group.\nA.3 Computations on tori\nSo far we have argued that for both ordinary central extensions and 2-group central extensions of a finite group G, for a G bundle to be in the image of a bundle whose structure group is the extension, the G bundle must have the property that x\u2217\u03c9 = 1, where \u03c9 is an element of group cohomology characterizing the extension, and x \u2208 Map(M,BG) encodes the G bundle.\nIn this section we will unpack that conclusion for the case that M is a torus. Recall that for a torus T (of any dimension) we have\nHk(T,Z) = Hom(\u2227kH,Z), (A.16)\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nwhere H = H1(T,Z), and the right hand side above can be viewed as skew-symmetric abelian group maps from the direct product of k copies of H \u2192 Z. Another way to say this is as follows. The cochains Ck(T,Z) are the group of poly linear maps H\u00d7k \u2192 Z, and the cocycles Zk(T,Z) are the subgroup of maps killed by the Hocschild differential. Each cocycle is cohomologous to a unique skew-symmetric cocycle and that skew-symmetric cocycle gives a preferred representative in the corresponding cohomology class. This works up to torsion with arbitrary coefficients. In particular if K is a finite abelian group we have the universal coefficient theorem short exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 Ext1(Hk\u22121(T,Z),K) \u2212\u2192 Hk(T,K) \u2212\u2192 Hom(\u2227kH,K) \u2212\u2192 0. (A.17)\nHowever, note that Hk\u22121(T,Z) is a free finitely generated abelian group and so\nExt1(Hk\u22121(T,Z),K) = 0, (A.18)\nwhich implies Hk(T,K) = Hom(\u2227kH,K). (A.19)\nThus, for a K-valued cocycle, on the torus T its cohomology class is uniquely determined by its projection to its skew-symmetric part. Now, let us consider particular examples. Earlier in section A.1 we argued that a G bundle arose from a \u0393 bundle for \u0393 an (ordinary) central extension determined by \u03c9 \u2208 H2(G,K) if and only if x\u2217\u03c9 = 1 \u2208 H2(M,K). From the analysis above, we see that if M = T 2, x\u2217\u03c9 is trivial if and only if\n\u03c9(g1, g2) \u03c9(g2, g1) = 1 (A.20)\nfor commuting pairs g1, g2 \u2208 G defining a G bundle (up to isomorphism). In this fashion we recover the constraint described earlier in section 2. For 2-groups and \u03c9 \u2208 H3(G,K), we can proceed similarly for M = T 3, and see that x\u2217\u03c9 = 1 implies that\n\u03c9(g1, g2, g3) \u03c9(g1, g3, g2) \u03c9(g3, g1, g2) \u03c9(g3, g2, g1) \u03c9(g2, g3, g1) \u03c9(g2, g1, g3) = 1 (A.21)\nas previously outlined in section 4.1. Concretely, given k and \u0393 defined by a central extension\n1 \u2212\u2192 Bk\u22122K \u2212\u2192 \u0393 \u2212\u2192 G \u2212\u2192 1, (A.22)\non a torus T k with H = H1(T k,Z), with central extension corresponding to a class [\u03c9] \u2208 Hk(G,K), we have\nHom(H,\u0393) \u2212\u2192 Hom(H,G) \u2212\u2192 Hom(\u2227kH,K), (A.23)\nwhere \u2227kH \u223c= Z, and so the homomorphism \u2227kH \u2192 K is determined by the element of K which is the image of 1 \u2208 \u2227kH = Z. That element of K is the total skew-symmetrization\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nof the cocycle \u03c9 when evaluated on the commuting k-tuple of elements of G describing an element of Hom(H,G). In other words, for k = 2, the image of the generator of \u22272H is\n\u03c9(g1, g2) \u03c9(g2, g1) , (A.24)\nand for k = 3, the image of the generator of \u22273H is\n\u03c9(g1, g2, g3) \u03c9(g1, g3, g2) \u03c9(g3, g1, g2) \u03c9(g3, g2, g1) \u03c9(g2, g3, g1) \u03c9(g2, g1, g3) .

It is a family of (complexes of) abelian groups over [X/G] which sits in an exact sequence\n1 \u2212\u2192 BK \u2212\u2192 X \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 1. (B.2)\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nNote that this means X , as a space (rather than an abelian group) is a disjoint union of stacks Xn over [X/G], where Xn is the preimage of n \u2208 Z. Each Xn is a K gerbe. For example,\nX0 = [X/G]\u00d7BK, X1 = [X/\u0393], (B.3)\nand for n > 1, Xn is the nth power of X1 = [X/\u0393] as a K gerbe over [X/G]. Now, we can dualize, by taking homomorphisms into Z. (Note that the usual dual of K is Hom(K,Z), whereas the Pontryagin dual of K is Hom(K,S1). Also note S1 =BZ=Z[1].) So, take the short exact sequence (B.2), and dualize to BS1. This becomes\n1 \u2212\u2192 Hom(Z, BS1) \u2212\u2192 Hom(X , BS1) \u2212\u2192 Hom(BK,BS1) \u2212\u2192 1. (B.4)\n(More generally, there are higher Ext\u2019s on the right, which can be shown to vanish here.) Define the dual group X\u0302 = Hom(X , BS1), and use the fact that\nHom(Z, BS1) = BS1, (B.5) Hom(BK,BS1) = Hom(K,S1), (B.6)\nto rewrite the sequence above as\n1 \u2212\u2192 BS1 \u2212\u2192 X\u0302 \u2212\u2192 Hom(K,S1) \u2212\u2192 1. (B.7)\nSince Hom(K,S1) is just the characters of K, we see that X\u0302 is a family of abelian groups, extending the characters by BS1, hence is decomposed by characters:\nX\u0302 = \u2210 \u03bb X\u0302\u03bb, (B.8)\nwhere X\u0302\u03bb is an S1-gerbe on [X/G]\u00d7 \u03bb, for any character \u03bb. The part corresponding to X1 is X\u0302\u03bb for \u03bb the tautological character. So far we have discussed ordinary decomposition at a very formal level as a mathematical duality. This description has two ingredients:\n\u2022 The data labelling components of the dual, namely characters of K, and\n\u2022 the classes of S1 gerbes on [X/G]\u00d7 \u03bb, which are\n\u2013 images under \u03bb of the original extension class of \u0393,\n\u2013 images under \u03bb of the characteristic class of the principal BK bundle [X/\u0393]\u2192 [X/G], an element of H2(G,K),\n\u2013 images under \u03bb of the extension class of Z by BK, namely Ext1(Z, BK).\nB.2 Decomposition for two-group extensions\nIn this section we will outline a formal understanding of the decomposition appearing elsewhere in this paper. In particular, we will argue that, for at least one version of\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\ndecomposition for two-group extensions, the universes should be classified by irreducible representations of K, and not10 BK.\nConsider the 2-group extension\n1 \u2212\u2192 BK \u2212\u2192 \u0393\u0303 \u2212\u2192 G \u2212\u2192 1. (B.9)\nHere, [X/\u0393\u0303]\u2192 [X/G] is a principal B2K bundle. Note BK = K[1], B2K = K[2]. As in section B.1, the extension given by formula (B.9) is equivalent to specifying a complex of abelian groups X\u0303 on [X/G] given as an extension\n1 \u2212\u2192 K[2] \u2212\u2192 X\u0303 \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192 1. (B.10)\nNow, we can dualize, but there are several possible targets, such as Z, Z[1] = BZ = S1, Z[2] = BS1, Z[3] = B2S1.\nWe will \u2018dualize\u2019 by taking Hom\u2019s into Z[3]. Applying this to sequence (B.10), we get\n1 \u2212\u2192 Hom(Z,Z[3]) \u2212\u2192 Hom(X\u0303 ,Z[3]) \u2212\u2192 Hom(K[2],Z[3]) \u2212\u2192 1. (B.11)\nDefine \u0302\u0303X = Hom(X\u0303 ,Z[3]), and note Hom(Z,Z[3]) = Z[3], (B.12)\nHom(K[2],Z[3]) = Hom(K,Z[1]) = Hom(K,S1), (B.13)\nto simplify that sequence to 1 \u2212\u2192 Z[3] \u2212\u2192 \u0302\u0303X \u2212\u2192 Hom(K,S1) \u2212\u2192 1, (B.14) so we see that \u0302\u0303X is fibered over characters of K, just as in the previous case. Note furthermore that \u0302\u0303X is an S1 2-gerbe over each component, exactly as expected. In this section we have made one choice of dualization, dualizing by taking Hom\u2019s to Z[3], to understand decomposition. In principle, there exist other dualizations, to Z[k] for other k. We leave an examination of the physical interpretation of such duals, if any, for future work."

            "text": "In this appendix we collect some results on group cohomology of various groups, which are used in the main text. For reference, recall in group cohomology that coboundaries are determined in degree two by\n(\u03b4\u03b1)(g1, g2, g3) = g1 \u00b7 \u03b1(g2, g3) \u03b1(g1g2, g3) \u03b1(g1, g2g3) \u03b1(g1, g2) , (C.1)\n10See e.g. ([52], appendix A), [94, 95] for perspectives on representations of BK.\n\u2013 32 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nand in degree three by\n(\u03b4\u03c9)(g1, g2, g3, g4) = g1 \u00b7 \u03c9(g2, g3, g4) \u03c9(g1g2, g3, g4) \u03c9(g1, g2g3, g4) \u03c9(g1, g2, g3g4) \u03c9(g1, g2, g3). (C.2)\nAs most of the computations in this paper involve group cohomology with trivial action on the coefficients, we will assume so unless otherwise noted. That said, orientifolds do involve group cohomology with nontrivial action on the coefficients, so on occasion we will use that group cohomology instead.\nC.1 Z2 In this section we will collect some useful results on the group cohomology of Z2, which will be useful in setting a pattern for results later in this appendix for more general products of Z2\u2019s.\nFirst, Hn(Z2,Z2) = Z2 (C.3)\nfor all (positive) n, where the group cohomology has trivial action on the coefficients, which is assumed throughout this appendix. Writing the elements of Z2 as {0, 1}, the only possibly nonzero normalized cochains are x = \u03c9(1, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 1). In this case,\nd\u03c9(1, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 1) = {\n2x n odd, 0 n even. (C.4)\nHowever, for Z2 coefficients, 2x = 0, hence d\u03c9 = 0 in all cases. Note that for U(1) coefficients, for example, Heven(Z2,U(1)) = 0, so the existence of these cocycles is tied to Z2 coefficients specifically.\nC.2 Z2 \u00d7 Z2 In this section we will collect some useful results on the group cohomology of Z2 \u00d7 Z2.\nFirst, consider the group\nH2(Z2 \u00d7 Z2,Z2) = (Z2)3. (C.5)\nWe represent the elements as Z2-valued normalized11 cocycles C(g, h), g, h \u2208 Z2 \u00d7 Z2. Write\nZ2 \u00d7 Z2 = {1, a, b, ab}, (C.6)\nand let x, y, z denote the generators of each of the three Z2\u2019s in the cohomology group, then normalized cocycles are listed in table 1. In particular, for Z2 coefficients and normalized cocycles, C(g, g) is coboundaryinvariant, and from table 1, we see that\nC(a, a) = x, C(b, b) = y, C(ab, ab) = z (C.7)\nnaturally encode the generators of each of the three Z2\u2019s in H2(Z2 \u00d7 Z2,Z2). 11Throughout this paper, a normalized cocycle is one which is the identity if any group element among its arguments is the identity.\n\u2013 33 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nThe cohomology groups of Z2 \u00d7 Z2 also include\nH2((Z2)2,U(1)) = Z2, H3((Z2)2,U(1)) = (Z2)3, H4((Z2)2,U(1)) = Z2 \u00d7 Z2. (C.8)\nDegree three cohomology was recently discussed in detail in [4] and ([5], appendix A), giving both representatives as well as invariants that distinguish different cohomology classes. For use elsewhere, let us characterize the elements of H4(Z2\u00d7Z2,U(1)) more precisely. Let \u03b1 denote a normalized 4-cocycle, meaning \u03b1(g1, g2, g3, g4) = 1 if any gi = 1. (In effect, this is a gauge choice, which requires in evaluating coboundaries that 3-cochains equal 1 if any of their arguments is 1.)\nIf we write each g \u2208 Z2 \u00d7 Z2 as g = (x, y) for x, y \u2208 {0, 1}, then normalized cocycles \u03b10,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,3 representing different elements of H4(Z2 \u00d7 Z2,U(1)) are as follows:\n\u03b10((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)) = +1, (C.9) \u03b11((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)) = (\u22121)x1y2y3y4 , (C.10) \u03b12((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)) = (\u22121)x1x2x3y4 , (C.11) \u03b13((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)) = (\u22121)x1y4(x2x3+y2y3). (C.12)\nAs elements of Z2 \u00d7 Z2, \u03b10 is the identity and \u03b13 = \u03b11\u03b12. For any pair (g, h) \u2208 Z2 \u00d7 Z2, we can define an invariant A(g, h) of normalized 4- cocycles, invariant under coboundaries, as\nA(g, h) = \u03b1(g, g, g, h) \u03b1(g, g, h, g) \u03b1(g, h, g, g) \u03b1(h, g, g, g) . (C.13)\nApplying these invariants to the normalized cocycles above, and writing Z2 \u00d7 Z2 = {1, a, b, ab}, with a = (1, 0), b = (0, 1), we compute invariants corresponding to elements of H4(Z2 \u00d7 Z2,U(1)) as in table 2. This can be useful in distinguishing elements of H4(Z2 \u00d7 Z2,U(1)), as cocycles are only defined up to coboundaries.\nC.3 Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u00d7 Z2\nWrite \u0393 = (Z2)3 = \u3008a, b, c\u3009, G = Z2 = \u3008a\u3009, K = (Z2)2 = \u3008b, c\u3009. Now,\nH3(\u0393,U(1)) = (Z2)7, (C.14)\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nwhich we can understand as arising from the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence as12\nH3(K,U(1)) = (Z2)3, (C.15) H1(G,H2(K,U(1))) = H1(Z2,Z2) = Z2, (C.16) H2(G,H1(K,U(1))) = H2(Z2, (Z2)2) = (Z2)2, (C.17)\nH3(G,U(1)) = Z2. (C.18)\nThus three of the generators of H3(\u0393,U(1)), call them \u03c91, \u03c92, \u03c93, are pullbacks from H3(K,U(1)) under the projection \u0393 = G\u00d7K \u2192 K.\nAnother generator, call it \u03c97, is similarly a pullback from H3(G,U(1)), and is given by\n\u03c97((a1, b1, c1), (a2, b2, c2), (a3, b3, c3)) = (\u22121)a1a2a3 (C.19)\nwhere here we identify a, b, c \u2208 {0, 1}. One more generator, call it \u03c94, comes from H1(G,H2(K,U(1))) and can be represented as \u03c94 = (\u22121)a1b2c3 . (C.20)\nThe final two generators of H3(\u0393,U(1)), call them \u03c95,6, come from H2(G,H1(K,U(1))), and can be represented as\n\u03c95 = (\u22121)a1a2b3 , (C.21) \u03c96 = (\u22121)a1a2c3 . (C.22)\nOne can check that all of the \u03c9i\u2019s are co-closed and that they are not cohomologous (they differ on coboundary invariants \u03c9(g, g, g) for some g \u2208 \u0393). Furthermore, it is also easy to check that the C field discrete torsion phase (3.2) on T 3 are nontrivial for \u03c94 evaluated on triples of the form (a1x, b2y, c3z)} and their permutations for\nx \u2208 {1, b1, c1, b1c1}, y \u2208 {1, a2, c2, a2c2}, z \u2208 {1, a2, b2, a2b2}. (C.23)\nThe group H3((Z2)3,Z2) = (Z2)10. (C.24)\n12Since \u0393 is just a direct sum, the extension class vanishes, and so all of the maps dn in the spectral sequence are trivial and so the sequence stabilizes at Ep,12 .\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nFrom Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre as before, we can write this as\nH3(K,Z2) = H3((Z2)2,Z2) = (Z2)4, (C.25) H1(G,H2(K,Z2)) = Hom(Z2, (Z2)3) = (Z2)3, (C.26) H2(G,H1(K,Z2)) = H2(Z2, (Z2)2) = (Z2)2, (C.27)\nH3(G,Z2) = Z2. (C.28)\nC.4 (Z2)k\nIn this appendix we give a basis of cocycles for Hn((Z2)k,Z2) for any n, k. Represent g \u2208 (Z2)k as g = (x1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , xk) with xi \u2208 {0, 1}. Pick k nonnegative integers m1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,mk such that m1 + m2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + mk = n. (C.29)\nThere will be N = ( n+ k \u2212 1 k \u2212 1 ) (C.30)\npossibilities, each of which corresponds to a cocycle. In particular, we will see that\nHn((Z2)k,Z2) = (Z2)N . (C.31)\nDefine a function fm : {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n} \u2212\u2192 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , k} (C.32)\n(m \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N}) by fm(a) = j (C.33)\nfor j such that m1 +m2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+mj\u22121 < a \u2264 m1 +m2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+mj (C.34)\n(in conventions in which m0 = 0). Then define\n\u03c9m(g1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , gn) = (\u2212)\u03b1 (C.35)\nfor \u03b1 = n\u220f a=1 xfm(a)a . (C.36) For example, consider Hn(Z2,Z2). In this case, N = 1 for all n, and f1(a) = 1 for all a \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n}. In each case, if we write Z2 = \u3008a\u3009, then a normalized cocycle for Hn(Z2,Z2) is (\u2212)a, for any n. For another example, consider the group cohomology of (Z2)2 = \u3008a, b\u3009, starting with H2((Z2)2,Z2). Here, N = 3, corresponding to the three sums\n1 + 1, 2 + 0, 0 + 2. (C.37)\nCorresponding respectively to those three sums we have the functions\nf1+1(1) = 1, f1+1(2) = 2, f2+0(1) = 1, f2+0(2) = 1, f0+2(1) = 2, f0+2(2) = 2,\n(C.38)\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\nwhich correspond to the three cocycles\n(\u2212)a1b2 , (\u2212)a1a2 , (\u2212)b1b2 . (C.39)\nOne can computeH3((Z2)2,Z2) similarly. Here, N = 4, corresponding to the four sums\n2 + 1, 1 + 2, 3 + 0, 0 + 3, (C.40)\nand corresponding to those sums are the functions\nf2+1(1) = 1, f2+1(2) = 1, f2+1(3) = 2, f1+2(1) = 1, f1+2(2) = 2, f1+2(3) = 2, f3+0(1) = 1, f3+0(2) = 1, f3+0(3) = 1, f0+3(1) = 2, f0+3(2) = 2, f0+3(3) = 2.\n(C.41)\nThe corresponding cocycles are\n\u03c92+1 = (\u2212)a1a2b3 , \u03c91+2 = (\u2212)a1b2b3 , \u03c93+0 = (\u2212)a1a2a3 , \u03c90+3 = (\u2212)b1b2b3 . (C.42)\nFor another example, for (Z2)3 = \u3008a, b, c\u3009, there is a basis of cocycles given by\nH1((Z2)3,Z2) = {(\u2212)a, (\u2212)b, (\u2212)c} (3 elements), (C.43) H2((Z2)3,Z2) = {(\u22121)a1a2 , (\u22121)a1b2 , (\u22121)a1c2 , (\u22121)b1b2 , (\u22121)b1c2 , (\u22121)c1c2}\n(6 elements), (C.44) H3((Z2)3,Z2) = {(\u22121)a1a2a3 , (\u22121)a1a2b3 , (\u22121)a1a2c3 , (\u22121)a1b2b3 , (\u22121)a1b2c3 , (\u22121)a1c2c3 ,\n(\u22121)b1b2b3 , (\u22121)b1b2c3 , (\u22121)b1c2c3 , (\u22121)c1c2c3} (10 elements). (C.45)\nFurthermore, Hn((Z2)3,Z2) has a basis of( n+ 2\n2 ) = (n+ 1)(n+ 2)2 (C.46)\ncocycles.\nC.5 Dihedral groups\nLet Dn denote the dihedral group of order 2n. Then, H3(Dn,U(1)) = {\nZ2n n odd, (Z2)2 \u00d7 Zn n even.\n(C.47)\nBelow we give an explicit cocycle for H2(D4, Z2) = (Z2)3. The group D4 is presented in terms of generators a, b, with relations\na2 = 1 = b4, aba = b\u22121 = b3, (C.48)\nand the results are expressed in terms of x, y, z which generate each of three Z2\u2019s in table 3. The corresponding invariant phases (g, h) only depend on one of the generators, x, as shown in table 4.\n\u2013 37 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 9 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 3 6\n1 b b2 b3 a ba b2a b3a 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 b 1 1 1 x 1 1 1 x b2 1 1 x x 1 1 x x b3 1 x x x 1 x x x a 1 y x y z yz xz yz ba 1 xy x y z xyz xz yz b2a 1 xy 1 y z xyz z yz b3a 1 xy 1 xy z xyz z xyz\nTable 3.
