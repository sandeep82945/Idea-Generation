    "abstractText": "pISSN 2093-9043 eISSN 2233-6273 Purpose: A direct aspiration, first pass technique (ADAPT) has been introduced as a rapid and safe thrombectomy strategy in patients with intracranial large vessel occlusion (LVO). The aim of the study is to determine the technical feasibility, safety, and functional outcome of ADAPT using the newly released large bore pHLO 0.072-inch aspiration catheter (AC; Phenox). Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively (October 2019\u2013November 2021) from 2 comprehensive stroke centers. Accessibility of the thrombus, vascular recanalization, time to recanalization, and procedure-related complications were evaluated. National Institutes of Health stroke scale scores at presentation and discharge and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at 90 days post-procedure were recorded. Results: Twenty-five patients (14 female, 11 male) with occlusions of the anterior circulation were treated. In 84% of cases, ADAPT led to successful recanalization with a median procedure time of 28 minutes. In the remaining cases, successful recanalization required (to a total of 96%; modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score 2b/3) the use of stent retrievers. No AC-related complications were reported. Other complications included distal migration of the thrombus, requiring a stent-retriever, and symptomatic PH2 hemorrhage in 16% and 4%, respectively. After 3 months, 52% of the patients had mRS scores of 0\u20132 with an overall mortality rate of 20%. Conclusion: Results from our retrospective case series revealed that thrombectomy of LVOs with pHLO AC is safe and effective in cases of large-vessel ischemic stroke. Rates of complete or near-complete recanalization after the first pass with this method might be used as a new benchmark in future trials.",

The aim of the study is to determine the technical feasibility, safety, and functional outcome of ADAPT using the newly released large bore pHLO 0.072-inch aspiration catheter (AC; Phenox). Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of data collected prospectively (October 2019\u2013November 2021) from 2 comprehensive stroke centers. Accessibility of the thrombus, vascular recanalization, time to recanalization, and procedure-related complications were evaluated. National Institutes of Health stroke scale scores at presentation and discharge and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at 90 days post-procedure were recorded. Results: Twenty-five patients (14 female, 11 male) with occlusions of the anterior circulation were treated. In 84% of cases, ADAPT led to successful recanalization with a median procedure time of 28 minutes. In the remaining cases, successful recanalization required (to a total of 96%; modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score 2b/3) the use of stent retrievers. No AC-related complications were reported. Other complications included distal migration of the thrombus, requiring a stent-retriever, and symptomatic PH2 hemorrhage in 16% and 4%, respectively. After 3 months, 52% of the patients had mRS scores of 0\u20132 with an overall mortality rate of 20%. Conclusion: Results from our retrospective case series revealed that thrombectomy of LVOs with pHLO AC is safe and effective in cases of large-vessel ischemic stroke.

            "text": "Endovascular thrombectomy has become part of the standard treatment for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation.1,2\nA direct aspiration, first pass technique (ADAPT) has been proposed as a versatile, fast, and cost-effective approach to thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke, with good recanalization rates and comparatively short procedure times and low associated costs.3,4 This technique utilizes aspiration as the first approach to revascularize the occluded vessel, and if this strategy fails, then the aspiration catheter (AC) is used in conjunction with a stent retriever to obtain revascularization. Results from numerous single-center reports suggest that the aspiration approach may be less traumatic with minimal vessel wall damage and fewer symptomatic hemorrhages.3,4 While the Contact Aspiration versus Stent Retriever for Successful Revascularization (ASTER) trial failed to confirm the superiority of this procedure with respect to safety,5 results from the COMPASS trial4 revealed noninferiority of ADAPT as a first-line procedure for thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke specifically with respect to functional outcomes achieved when compared to stent retrievers as the first-line approach.5,6\nThe current study presents the combined results from 2 comprehensive stroke centers in which patients diagnosed with LVO of the anterior circulation underwent thrombectomies using ADAPT as a first-line approach with the pHLO 0.072-inch large-bore ACs (Phenox), a new larger bore AC that aims to maximize the inner diameter, which has recently emerged and is currently available for use.7,8"

An 8F guide sheath (NeuronMAX 0.088 inch; Penumbra or CEREBASE DA 0.090 inch; Cerenovus) was inserted via a transfemoral approach into the internal carotid artery on the affected side. The guide catheter was placed in a distal location (e.g., in the petrous segment if possible).\nADAPT was then performed. The pHLO AC was advanced to the level of the occlusion, typically via a Headway 0.021 (MicroVention) or 0.025 Velocity microcatheter (Penumbra)\nand a 0.014-inch microwire. A 125-cm pHLO AC was used in 15 of 25 cases (60%); a 135-cm pHLO AC was used in the remaining 10 cases (40%). The procedure was performed using various microwires, including Traxcess 0.014 (MicroVention) and Synchro 2 Support 0.014 (Stryker).\nAfter positioning the pHLO AC with the tip inside the proximal part of the thrombus, the microcatheter and microwire were removed and aspiration was initiated using a vacuum pump. Aspiration was continued for approximately 4 minutes after flow had ceased. The catheter was then removed slowly with additional manual aspiration applied to the guide catheter. If insufficient angiographic recanalization was achieved the aspiration attempt was repeated to engage the clot at the distal tip of the AC; alternatively, an additional thrombectomy device was introduced. The choice between these 2 options was at the discretion of the operator."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The revascularization rates observed in our patient series are consistent with and in some cases superior to those reported in the literature.7-17 In this study, we successfully recanalized 76% of the anterior circulation thrombi at the first pass. This fraction grew to 96% when using a combination of techniques. Functional independence, as well as the rates of mortality and the development of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, were similar to those reported in the aforementioned recent meta-analysis.17 In other retrospective case series, 25% of the cases that featured a large-bore AC required the concomitant use of a stent retriever; the latter device functioned as an anchor that delivered the AC up to the level of the thrombus.8,17-21 In our study, the thrombus site was accessible to the large-bore AC in most of the cases (96%) and did not require support from a stent retriever.\nNo ENTs were reported in our patient series, and the frequency of EDTs requiring a stent-retriever (at 8%) was similar to that reported in recent literature22 on stent-retriever or combined techniques. EDT rates varied in different case series, largely reflecting variations in the location of the target occlusion, the composition of the thrombus, whether or not IVT was provided to patients before endovascular treatment, and the types of thrombectomy devices used.23,24\nOur results find numerous confirmations in the literature. Li and Ribo25 reviewed the clinical experience and in vitro studies of REACT ACs (Medtronic), large-bore ACs that feature a polytetrafluoroethylene liner, and nitinol reinforcement.\nIn vitro studies support the effectiveness of REACT catheters. The rates of procedural success and recanalization at the first attempt, along with the null incidence of complications related to REACT catheters, demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the devices, in terms of clinical experience.25 Another recent study26 reported initial experience in 9 patients with AXS Vecta 71 and 74 for mechanical thrombectomy using aspiration and combination techniques for the purpose of assessing their safety and efficacy, resulting in successful revascularization in a similar proportion of cases as previously published studies (89%), using both ADAPT and the stent-retriever plus a local aspiration technique, without complications.\nA recent meta-analysis14 including 20 studies with a total of 6,311 patients revealed that ADAPT resulted in similar clinical outcomes compared to procedures performed with stent retrievers, albeit requiring more likely additional therapy compared to those in the stent retriever group. Results from previous studies reveal that anatomical and technical factors have a significant influence on the likelihood of effective recanalization. From an anatomical point of view, the site of arterial occlusion2 and the angle of interaction between the thrombus and the AC15 were both associated with the likelihood of successful recanalization.\nThe ACs used in these procedures must be trackable so that they can be navigated easily and atraumatically through tortuous intracranial vessels. Some concerns were raised regarding the safety of navigation using these large bore devices, especially when used in procedures involving tortuous vessels at the ophthalmic artery. These catheters must also have a large inner diameter and wall strength that will accommodate maximum aspiration force and resist collapse. To address this concern, the ACs are typically constructed in multiple segments of varying flexibility with those that are stiffer in proximal locations and those that are more compliant distally.16\nThis latter principle was highlighted in a recent study of the physical properties of ACs used in thrombectomies performed on stroke patients that focused on catheter tip force, aspiration flow rates, and effective flow lumens.15 As shown, larger internal diameters will result in lower resistance (R) and a larger flow rate (Q). As shown, larger inner lumen diameters are more effective at promoting thrombus removal.15 While these properties have not yet been explored in large clinical trials,4,5 the results of this analysis might explain the higher efficacy profiles of procedures involving ADAPT. For example,\nwww.neurointervention.org\nresults from a recent meta-analysis published by Gory et al.17 reported successful recanalization (i.e., mTICI scores of 2b\u20133) using ADAPT in 66% of cases of acute stroke; a rescue strategy using a stent retriever in another 31% of the cases yielded an overall 89% success rate at achieving mTICI scores of 2b\u20133.\nOur study has several limitations. We recognize the limitations inherent in its design, the number of enrolled patients in 2 centers, and the absence of a control group. Furthermore, the angiographic images were assessed by the interventional neuroradiologist performing the endovascular procedure and thus might be biased toward higher mTICI scores."
