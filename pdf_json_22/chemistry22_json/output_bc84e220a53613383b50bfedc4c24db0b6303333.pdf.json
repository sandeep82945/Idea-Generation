However, theory and experiments report conflicting findings regarding their dynamics. The lack of consensus is mostly caused by a limited understanding of specifics of self-propulsion mechanisms at the nanoscale. Here, we study a generic model of a self-propelled nanoparticle that does not rely on a particular mechanism. Instead, its main assumption is the fundamental symmetry of microscopic dynamics of chemical reactions: the principle of microscopic reversibility. Significant consequences of this assumption arise if we subject the particle to the action of an external time-periodic force. The particle diffusion coefficient then becomes enhanced compared to the unbiased dynamics. The enhancement can be controlled by the force amplitude and frequency. We also derive the power spectrum of particle trajectories. Among new effects stemming from the microscopic reversibility are the enhancement of the spectrum at all frequencies and sigmoid-shaped transitions and a peak at characteristic frequencies of rotational diffusion and external forcing. The microscopic reversibility is a generic property of a broad class of chemical reactions, therefore we expect that the presented results will motivate new experimental studies aimed at testing of our predictions. This could provide new insights into dynamics of catalytic macromolecules.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nActive microparticles capable of self-propelled motion are at the forefront of current research in physics, chemistry, and biology.1\u20135 The vivid interest in their properties is driven by potential applications, e.g., in microscopic robotics,5\u20137 for targeted transport of drugs8\u201310 and microcargoes,11 for cleaning polluted habitats,12\u201314 and working as sensors in biological environments15 to name a few. Inspired by molecular motors, there is an ongoing miniaturisation efforts to develop nanosized artificial machines capable to operate, e.g., in the intracellular environment.16\nHowever, tracking individual physical processes that can induce the self-propulsion of nanoparticles is a rather challenging task. Instead, several experimental works have focused on average transport characteristics like particle\u2019s diffusion constant.17\u201323 Conclusions regarding the nature and existence of self-propulsion are then inferred indirectly based on values of such ensemble-averaged characteristics and confronting them with results for basic theoretical models.24 Conversely, theoretical works often conjecture a specific mechanisms of self-propelling and discuss the behaviour of the diffusion constant.25\u201328 The resulting link between experimental data and theoretical models\na)artem.ryabov@mff.cuni.cz b)mykola.tasinkevych@ntu.ac.uk\nis thus indirect only. As a consequence, there are often conflicting views26,29\u201334 on the nature of active motion at these tiny scales and even on whether the catalytic activity of macromolecules can lead to their active self-propelled dynamics.31\u201333\nDespite a number of theoretical and experimental studies of dynamics of active macromolecules,35 the effects of a fundamental premise of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics \u2013 the principle of microscopic reversibility36 (MR) remains largely unexplored in this domain. In our recent work,37 we have analyzed a generic model of the active motion at the nanoscale. The developed model did not rely on a specific self-propulsion mechanisms, but assumed that both the chemical reactions powering the self-propulsion and the translational Brownian motion of the particle comply with the MR principle. We predicted an increased diffusivity and mobility of active nanoparticles compared to a passive particle and to models where MR is not included. As a result of assuming MR, the both parameters become dependent on an amplitude of constant external force applied on the nanoparticle.\nHere, we extend the model of Ref. 37 by incorporating a time-dependent external force of magnitude F (t) acting upon the active nanoparticle. Motivated by spectroscopic measurements, we assume the force being a superposition of a constant and harmonically oscillating forces, i.e.,\nF (t) = Fdc + Fac cos(\u2126t+ \u03b1). (1)\nOur main objective is to describe new qualitative effects stemming from MR in this model.\n2 First, we will show how parameters of the external force (1), i.e., Fdc, Fac and \u2126, can modify the particle\u2019s diffusion coefficient. Second, we will derive the power spectrum of the particle stochastic trajectories. The spectrum can be measured in single-particle tracking experiments. It contains a more detailed information on the underlying dynamic mechanisms than the diffusion coefficient alone. All discussed quantities will be compared with corresponding ones for the analogous reference model, where MR is neglected. Experimental tests of our predictions can decide on the relevance of the MR principle for the self-propulsion at the nanoscale. This in turn, can exclude from consideration (or confirm) a broad range of mechanisms obeying the assumed symmetry, narrowing down possibilities for theoretical modeling. Such tests can also guide an experimental development toward a resolution of existing controversies.\nIn the following Section II, we introduce our model of a nanoparticle with microscopically reversible propulsion (Sec. II A), discuss its coarse-grained continuous-space dynamics and estimate all model parameters in accord with relevant experimental data (Sec. II B). In addition, we solve the Langevin equations for the time-periodic driving force (Sec. II C), introduce reference models (Sec. IID and Sec. II E), and compare our approach with previous theoretical works (Sec. II F). In Sec. III, the derivation of two-time correlation functions is explained. These are then used to derive and discuss the particle\u2019s diffusion coefficient (Sec. IV) and the power spectrum (Sec. V)."

Dynamics of the center of mass position r of such a particle is governed by the Langevin equation37\ndr dt = ua(t)n(t) + \u00b5F (t) +\n\u221a 2D \u03be(t). (2)\nLast two terms on the right-hand side of (2) represent overdamped Brownian motion in the external force field F , \u00b5 is the mobility, D = \u00b5kBT the diffusion coefficient, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature of ambient environment.

Over time, the orientation undergoes rotational diffusion38 characterized by the diffusion constant Dr, meaning the angle\nFIG. 1. Schematics of a chemically active nanoparticle (large blue blob), whose dynamics is governed by the Langevin equation (2). A forward chemical reaction, represented as conversion of the small red circle to the light-blue one, occurs with reaction rate k+ and shifts the particle along its instantaneous orientation n(t) by \u03b4r. There can exist a reversed reaction happening with rate k\u2212 and associated with the shift (\u2212\u03b4r). Time-reversibility of microscopic dynamics imposes the detailed balance condition (5) upon the ratio k+/k\u2212. In practice, reaction free energies are typically much higher than kBT (\u2206Gr \u2273 5kBT ), hence k+ \u226b k\u2212 and backward steps cannot be observed. Furthermore, the particle orientation n(t) undergoes rotational diffusion and there is external force F (t) dragging the particle along x direction (horizontal arrow). If such dynamics is observed on coarse-grained macroscopic scales, the force affects magnitude ua(t) of the active particle velocity according to Eq. (6). This coupling of chemical and mechanical processes originates from the detailed balance (5). It implies remarkable behavior of the diffusion coefficient, Eq. (32) and Fig. 2, and spectral power density, Eq. (38), Figs. 3 and 4.\n\u03d5(t) itself performs a Brownian motion\n\u03d5(t) = \u03d5(0) + \u221a 2Dr \u222b t 0 \u03ber(t \u2032) dt\u2032, (4)\ndriven by the delta-correlated zero-mean Gaussian white noise \u03ber(t). The noises \u03ber(t) and \u03be(t) are statistically independent. It can be rather challenging to precisely control the particle orientation in experiments with nanoswimmers. Therefore, in this work, the initial value \u03d5(0) in (4) is assumed to be a random variable homogeneously distributed within the interval [0, 2\u03c0), yielding random initial orientation of the particle. In the microscopic model, the magnitude ua(t) represents stochastic jumps of the particle driven by chemical reactions,37 see Fig. 1. We assume that a forward chemical reaction and the corresponding jump from r to [r+n(t)\u03b4r] occur with rate k+. The microscopic reversibility 36,39\u201341 then ensures that there exists also a backward reaction\n3 accompanied by the jump from [r + n(t)\u03b4r] to r and its rate k\u2212 is related to k+ by the local detailed balance condition42\nk+ k\u2212 = exp\n( \u2206Gr \u2212 \u03b4W\nkBT\n) , (5)\nwhere \u2206Gr stands for the reaction free energy and \u03b4W for the work done on the particle by all external (mechanical, electromagnetic) forces acting on the particle during its jump r \u2192 [r + n(t)\u03b4r].\nThe condition (5) follows from reversibility with respect to time-reversal of a more detailed microscopic dynamics (classical Hamiltonian or quantum) upon which our effective stochastic time-evolution (2) is constructed via elimination of fast degrees of freedom.43"

(6) from the microscopic model can be found in our previous work in Ref. 37. The essence\nof this derivation is as follows: In the microscopic model, the active motion is represented by a random walk in the direction of the particle orientation. The forward (backward) steps of length \u03b4r happen with the rate k+ (k\u2212). The continuum (diffusive) approximation of the dynamics of this random walk process, subjected to the condition that reaction rates k\u00b1 obey the detailed balance condition (5), leads to the Langevin equation with velocity (6).\nRelation (8), \u00b5ckBT = Dc, \u00b5kBT = D, and Stokes\u2019 law \u00b5 = 1/6\u03c0\u03b7RH with \u03b7 being the dynamic viscosity of ambient environment and RH the hydrodynamic radius of nanoparticle, allow us to estimate magnitudes of all the model parameters, which we will use for illustrating our results in Figs. 2, 3, and partly in Fig. 4. For this purpose, we adopt numerical values inspired by ones reported for catalytically active urease.20\u201322 We take k+ \u2248 105 s\u22121, Dr \u2248 105 s\u22121, \u03b4r \u2248 5 nm, RH \u2248 20 nm.

All the terms on the third line are intrinsic to the present microscopically reversible model and would occur neither in ABP nor in BM models.

(28)\nWhen studied in experiments, MSD can provide a valuable insight into the type of microscopic propulsion mechanism used by the nanoparticle. Its exact analytical expression contains a superposition of linear, bounded oscillating and exponentially decaying terms that follow from Eqs. (A.1) and (A.2) at t1 = t2 = t. Let us inspect two experimentally relevant regimes where this result considerably simplifies.\nRotational diffusion is the fastest diffusive process in our model. It happens on the characteristic time scale \u223c 1/Dr. If the time-resolution in an experiment is high enough to\n6 capture the rotational diffusion, then, at short times, one would observe the linear growth of MSD superimposed with the ballistic term,\n\u27e8[\u2206r(t)]2\u27e9 \u2248 4 ( D +\nDc 2\n) t+ [ u2 +\n\u00b52c 4\n( F 2dc +\nF 2ac 2\n)] t2,\n(29) for t \u226a 1/Dr.\nEquation (29) gives MSD of very short persistent trajectories. While moving along such a trajectory, the particle essentially does not rotate. Therefore, the diffusive growth of MSD described by the linear term in (29) is caused just by the translational Brownian motion (D) and fluctuations in the active propulsion velocity ua(t) (Dc/2). Remarkably, the magnitude of the ballistic term (\u223c t2) is enhanced by force amplitudes F 2ac and F 2 dc as compared to the corresponding result for ABP model.82\u201384\nOn the other hand, experimental techniques such as the pulsed field gradient NMR,30,31,46,47 neutron scattering,48 and various single-particle tracking methods20,44,45 can measure the long-time effective diffusion coefficient\nD = lim t\u2192\u221e \u27e8[\u2206r(t)]2\u27e9 4t . (30)\nRemarkably, in this limit, we have\nlim t\u2192\u221e \u27e8[\u2206x(t)]2\u27e9 t = lim t\u2192\u221e \u27e8[\u2206y(t)]2\u27e9 t = lim t\u2192\u221e \u27e8[\u2206r(t)]2\u27e9 2t ,\n(31) i.e., the diffusive spreading of the particle PDF around its mean position is isotropic. This holds in spite of the fact that the driving force F (t) breaks spatial isotropy of the problem by dragging the particle along the x axis. By evaluating the limit in (30) we get the effective diffusion coefficient\nD = D + Dc 2 + u2 2Dr + (\u00b5cFdc) 2 32Dr\n+ (\u00b5cFac)\n2\n4Dr D2r (4Dr)2 +\u21262 .\n(32)\nThe long-time diffusion coefficient D depends on the constant part of active velocity u, on the magnitude and frequency of the external force F (t), and on the rotational diffusion constant Dr in a rather nontrivial manner. Physical origins of individual contributions to D are as follows. The contribution (D +Dc/2) is identical to the shorttime diffusivity in Eq. (29). Its first part reflects the passive translational Brownian motion, for which we have\nDBM = D (33)\neven in the presence of the external harmonic driving. The second part, Dc/2, arises due to fluctuations in magnitude of the active velocity ua(t), Eq. (6). The u-dependent term in (32) quantifies uncertainty of the particle position stemming from the rotational diffusion of the constant part u of the active velocity\n0 50 100 150 200 0.9\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\nFIG. 2. Diffusion coefficients of active nanoparticles driven by an external time-periodic force with the amplitude (1) plotted as functions of driving frequency \u2126. The solid line represents D from Eq. (32) for the model with microscopically reversible active propulsion (MRABP) illustrated in Fig. 1. The dashed line marks the corresponding result for ABP model where the microscopic reversibility is neglected, cf. DABP in Eq. (34). Plotted values are scaled by the diffusion constant D of a passive Brownian particle. The reason for force-dependent enhancement of D compared to D and DABP can be traced back to the detailed balance condition (5). At the nanoscale, DABP and D nearly coincide as discussed after Eq. (34). Parameters used are those estimated in Sec. II B and we set Fdc = Fac = 10 pN.\nua(t). This contribution vanishes with increasing Dr (at fixed u) since the rapidly rotating direction of the velocity has hardly any effect on the translational motion. This term appears also in the effective diffusion coefficient for the harmonically driven ABP model:\nDABP = D + u2\n2Dr . (34)\nRemarkably, the value of u2/2Dr is rather low as compared to D of a nanoparticle. Using parameter estimates from Sec. II B, we get D \u2248 1.3\u00d7 10\u221211 m/s2 and u2/2Dr \u2248 5\u00d7 10\u221218 m/s2 at u = 1 \u00b5m/s, which is a relatively large value when related to particle\u2019s hydrodynamic radius RH \u2248 20 nm. The both terms become comparable at u \u2248 1.6 mm/s that would correspond to a nanoparticle traveling at staggering 80000RH per second. The fundamental reason for u2/2Dr being vanishingly small as compared to D is fast rotational diffusion of small particles since the rotational diffusion coefficient scales as Dr \u223c 1/R3H. Although the Fdc-dependent term in (32) might seem similar to the u-dependent one [both (\u00b5cFdc) and u have dimensions of velocity], there is a significant difference in physical origins between the two. While the velocity un(t) rotates with the particle, the line of action of the external force F (t) is fixed in space (parallel with the x axis). The force, however, influences the magnitude\n7 of active velocity ua(t), as described by the projection Fn(r, t) in Eq. (6). When n(t) and F (t) are parallel, the projection attains its maximal magnitude and it vanishes for perpendicular orientation of the two vectors. Because n(t) rotates erratically, the stochastic changes of Fn(r, t) enhance uncertainty of the particle position as quantified by D.\nThe last, Fac-dependent, term in (32) appears for analogous physical reasons. Notably, its magnitude can be controlled by the frequency \u2126 of the external force. This dependence is reflected in Fig. 2 showing D from Eq. (32) (solid line) and DABP from (34) (dashed), both being normalized by the diffusion coefficient of the overdamped Brownian motion (33). Interestingly, the force-dependent contributions to D, whose fundamental origins can be traced back to the detailed balance condition (5), provide a way to control the diffusivity by applying external forcing upon the particle. This effect is a direct consequence of the microscopic reversibility of active propulsion mechanism. Therefore, it is missing in the ABP model and in the passive Brownian motion.\nTesting such dependence in an experiment may provide a hint regarding microscopic reversibility of the underlying active propulsion mechanism. The zero-mean harmonic force seems to be well-suited for such purposes because it does not induce a net mean displacement of the particle."

Moreover, the power spectrum frequently attains a simple form, where individual terms characterize various diffusive mechanisms involved.\nWe will derive Srr(\u03c9) by breaking it down into two parts: Srr(\u03c9) = Sxx(\u03c9) + Syy(\u03c9), with the marginal power spectrum of \u2206x(t) given by\nSxx(\u03c9) = lim \u03c4\u2192\u221e\n1\n\u03c4 \u2329\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u222b \u03c4 0 \u2206x(t)ei\u03c9tdt \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u232a\n= lim \u03c4\u2192\u221e\n1\n\u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c4\u222b\u222b 0 0 Cxx(t1, t2)e i\u03c9(t1\u2212t2)dt1dt2, (36)\nand Syy(\u03c9) being defined similarly for \u2206y(t). To evaluate Sxx(\u03c9), we perform the double integration in the second line of Eq. (36) inserting there the exact expression (A.1) for Cxx(t1, t2). Carrying out a similar calculation for Syy(\u03c9), we find the isotropy relation\nSxx(\u03c9) = Syy(\u03c9), (37) analogous to Eqs. (31) for MSDs in the long-time limit. Eventually, we arrive at the final result\nSrr(\u03c9) =\n( D +\nDc 2\n) 8\n\u03c92 +\nu2\nDr\n( 4\n\u03c92 \u2212 2\nD2r + \u03c9 2\n) + (\u00b5cFdc) 2\n16Dr\n( 4\n\u03c92 \u2212 2 (4Dr)2 + \u03c92 ) + (\u00b5cFac)\n2 Dr (4Dr)2 +\u21262\n( 2\n\u03c92 \u2212 (4Dr)\n2 + \u03c92 \u2212 3\u21262\n(4Dr)4 + (\u03c92 \u2212 \u21262)2 + 2(4Dr)2(\u21262 + \u03c92)\n) .\n(38)\nAll dynamic processes contributing to particle\u2019s diffusivity are reflected in D in Eq. (32). In addition to their magnitudes that enter the expression for D, the power spectrum (38) resolves corresponding characteristic time scales on which the individual processes happen.\nThe first, (D+Dc/2)-dependent part of the result (38) has identical functional form with the power spectrum of two-dimensional overdamped Brownian motion:\nS(BM)rr (\u03c9) = 8D\n\u03c92 . (39)\nThe power-law dependence on \u03c9 with exponent 2 reflects\nthe typical Brownian scaling of position with time. At low frequencies (\u03c9 \u2192 0), corresponding to t \u2192 \u221e limit in the time domain, the whole expression (38) reduces to just such a power law,\nSrr(\u03c9) \u2248 8D \u03c92 , \u03c9 \u2192 0, (40)\nwhere the effective diffusion coefficient D is that from Eq. (32).\nThe u-dependent term in (38) consists of a combination of the Brownian power-law dependence on \u03c9 and the Lorentzian function describing the rotational diffusion\n8 of the particle orientation. As the damping rate in the Lorentzian part of this term, there is the characteristic \u201cfrequency\u201d (inverse time scale) Dr for this process to happen.\nSuch u-dependent term is also the only additional one that appears in the power spectrum of a harmonically driven ABP model:\nS(ABP)rr (\u03c9) = 8D\n\u03c92 +\nu2\nDr\n( 4\n\u03c92 \u2212 2\nD2r + \u03c9 2\n) . (41)\nAt the nanoscale, its magnitude is rather negligible when compared to the Brownian part 8D/\u03c92, i.e., S (ABP) rr (\u03c9) \u2248 S (BM) rr (\u03c9) holds. The reason for this is the large Dr of small particles as discussed in details in the paragraph after Eq. (34). The Fdc-dependent contribution in (38) has an analogous form as the u-dependent one. Yet, the characteristic time scale (1/4Dr) for the process it represents is 4 times shorter than that of the rotational diffusion (1/Dr) occurring in the previous term. The time 1/4Dr can be roughly understood as the decay time of auto-correlations of the product n(t)Fn(r, t) in Eq. (6) for ua(t). The individual constituents of this product are already correlated since Fn(r, t) depends on n(t): As the particle orientation changes due to the rotational diffusion, the magnitude of the force projection onto the instantaneous particle orientation changes as well. Interestingly, this correlation is transferred evenly to power spectra of both coordinates regardless the orientation of the force F (t) in space, viz the isotropy relation (37). Behavior of the Fac-dependent term in (38) with \u03c9 can be rather rich as compared to other terms. Figure 3 illustrates the power spectrum (38) of the microscopically reversible model (MRABP) and the one of a standard periodically driven ABP without the microscopic reversibility of the active propulsion, Eq. (41), for parameters estimated in Sec. II B and two values of Fdc. In Fig. 3, curves marking Srr(\u03c9) (solid and dashed-dotted line) indicate that the Fac-dependent term is responsible for two sigmoid-shaped transitions: one close to the driving frequency \u03c9 \u2248 \u2126 and one near \u03c9 \u2248 Dr. The transitions are visible at for Fdc = 0 and Fdc = 10 pN. As a result of nonzero Fdc, we observe an enhancement in the low-frequency part of the spectrum. For very high \u03c9, spectra (38) at Fdc = 0 and Fdc \u0338= 0 coincide. Both functions remain significantly larger than S (ABP) rr (\u03c9), Eq. (41), which is nearly identical with S (BM) rr (\u03c9), Eq. (39), for all plotted \u03c9. Moreover, if parameters Fac, Dr, and \u2126 meet certain conditions, the sigmoid-shaped transition around the driving frequency \u03c9 \u2248 \u2126 transforms into a peak, which we demonstrate in Fig. 4. To observe the peak, the Facdependent term should attain significant values compared to other terms. This can be achieved either by increasing Fac or by a proper choice of Dr, see solid and dasheddotted curves in Fig. 4 demonstrating the latter option. Also, \u2126 should be far enough from low frequencies, where\n100 102 104 106 108\n1\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\nFIG. 3.

Plotted spectra are normalized by S (BM)\nrr (\u03c9), the spectrum of over-\ndamped Brownian motion given in Eq. (39). Parameters used are those estimated in Sec. II B, Fac = 10 pN, and \u2126 = 10\n3 s\u22121. For the active particle with microscopically reversible propulsion (MRABP), we plot Srr(\u03c9) from Eq. (38) for Fdc = 10 pN (solid line) and Fdc = 0 (dashed-dotted line). The nearly constant dashed line represents the power spectrum S (ABP) rr (\u03c9) for ABP model where the microscopic reversibility of active propulsion is neglected, see Eq. (41). The Fac-dependent term in (38) causes the sigmoid-shaped changes of MRABP curves near \u03c9 \u2248 \u2126 and \u03c9 \u2248 Dr observed at Fdc = 0. The Fdcdependent term enhances the variation of the solid line near \u03c9 \u2248 Dr as compared to the Fdc = 0 case.\nSrr(\u03c9) is dominated by the Brownian power-law behavior (40). The width and the height of the peak can be controlled by the \u201cdamping\u201d 4Dr. If 4Dr is smaller than \u2126, a rather pronounced peak occurs (solid line). The condition \u2126 > Dr means that the external force should oscillate faster than the rotational diffusion happens. Contrary, if the rotational diffusion is faster, the peak vanishes (dashed line in Fig. 4).\nLet us note that Fdc- and Fac-dependent terms in the power spectrum Srr(\u03c9) given in Eq. (38) emerge due to the assumption of the microscopic reversibility of the active propulsion mechanism. Therefore, these terms are naturally missing in the ABP model, where MR is not taken into account. Therefore, the derived spectrum S (ABP) rr (\u03c9) in Eq. (41) for the periodically driven ABP model is identical with the one in case without the external driving force.86"

Spectral power density (38) of an active particle with microscopically reversible propulsion subjected to the external time-periodic driving. The spectrum is plotted for three different values of the rotational diffusion coefficient Dr and normalized by the power spectrum S (BM)\nrr (\u03c9) of the\noverdamped Brownian motion given in Eq. (39). Other model parameters are chosen as in Sec. II B, Fdc = 0, Fac = 10 pN, and \u2126 = 103 s\u22121. The peak in Srr(\u03c9) around \u03c9 \u2248 \u2126 develops when Dr < \u2126. Its height can be controlled by Dr, which also changes the background spectral power at other frequencies \u03c9.\nMarkov jump processes, the principle is incorporated by means of the local detailed balance condition obeyed by transition rates, while in continuous-space driven diffusions it is implemented via the fluctuation-dissipation relation. Both these ways occur in the modeling of the active propulsion mechanism in the present work. As our main results, we have discussed prominent effects stemming from this fundamental principle in the case of a chemically driven active nanoparticle whose propulsion mechanism is made consistent with MR. When an external time-periodic force is acting upon such a particle, its effective diffusion coefficient and the spectral power density are significantly enhanced in comparison to the force-free dynamics and to the corresponding reference model not obeying MR. The diffusion coefficient of such particle contains new contributions that increase its value beyond the one obtained for the reference active Brownian particle model without MR. The magnitude of the enhancement can be externally controlled by varying the amplitude of a constant part of the applied force, the amplitude of a time-periodic part of the force, and the frequency of the force oscillations. All the new contributions to the diffusion coefficient have their counterparts in the power spectrum of stochastic trajectories of the nanoparticle. The spectrum also\nreflects time scales of underlying dynamic processes responsible for these contributions. As new qualitative effects caused by MR in the spectrum, we report sigmoidshaped transitions and a sharp peak that can occur at the frequency of the external driving and at the characteristic time scale associated with rotational diffusion of the particle.\nOverall, we have selected the external time-periodic driving force having in mind possible spectroscopic verifications of the reported hallmarks of the microscopic reversibility. To this end, we have also chosen values of the model parameters close to the ones of recently studied catalytic nanoparticles. We expect that the results presented here will motivate new experimental studies in line with our predictions, which in turn can shed a new light on the nature of chemically driven self-propulsion at the nanoscale. Moreover, our findings can provide new insights into high values of experimentally measured diffusion coefficients of small active particles, view of a potentially significant impact of local (constant and time-dependent) forces on the diffusivity and the power spectrum."
