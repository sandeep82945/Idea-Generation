    "abstractText": "Three new polyketides (penidihydrocitrinins A\u2013C, 1\u20133) and fourteen known compounds (4\u201317) were isolated from the deep-sea-derived Penicillium citrinum W17. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive analyses of 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, and ECD calculations. Compounds 1\u201317 were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory and anti-osteoporotic bioactivities. All isolates exhibited significant inhibitory effects on LPS-stimulated nitric oxide production in murine brain microglial BV-2 cells in a dose-response manner. Notably, compound 14 displayed the strongest effect with the IC50 value of 4.7 \u03bcM. Additionally, compounds 6, 7, and 8 significantly enhanced osteoblast mineralization, which was comparable to that of the positive control, purmorphamine. Furthermore, these three compounds also suppressed osteoclastogenesis in a dose-dependent manner under the concentrations of 2.5 \u03bcM, 5.0 \u03bcM, and 10 \u03bcM.",

            "text": "Marine microbes are an ideal source to yield diverse secondary metabolites with unprecedented structures. As a matter of fact, about half of the new marine natural products are produced by marine microorganisms [1\u20133], especially those living in the deep sea under extremely tough environments such as low oxygen concentration, high salt, high hydrostatic pressure, and absence of light, which require various biochemical and physiological adaptations for survival [4,5]. These adaptions are accompanied by adjustments of gene regulation, resulting in the formation of different metabolic pathways to give birth to a large number of new secondary metabolites [4,5]. Polyketides are a class of structurally diverse natural products with carbon skeletons originating from the polymerization of short-chain carboxylic acids units, including acetate, propionate, butyrate, etc. [6], which are catalyzed by polyketide synthases (PKSs) [7]. Polyketides have attracted wide attention due to their promising bioactivities [8,9]. For example, salinosporamide A showed significant proteasomal chymotrypsin-like proteolytic inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 1.3 nM [10]; microketide A exhibited remarkable antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Nocardia brasiliensis, Kocuria rhizophila, and Bacillus anthraci with an equal minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value (0.19 \u00b5g/mL) to that of ciprofloxacin [11]; and theissenone exhibited potent nitric oxide production inhibitory activity in murine brain microglial BV-2 cells with an IC50 value\nMar.

As some of the most abundant fungi of the world, Penicillium species could generate a broad spectrum of unique polyketides. For instance, two new tricyclic polyketides, penijanthinones A and B, were isolated from P. janthinellum HK1-6 [13,14]; two new C-8 benzoyl-substituted azaphilones, pinazaphilones A and B, were obtained from Penicillium sp. HN29-3B1 [13,14]; chloctanspirones A and B, possessing an unprecedented bicyclo [2.2.2] octane-2-spiro cyclohexane skeleton, were discovered in P. terrestre [15]. As part of our continuing discovery of structurally novel and biologically interesting compounds from deep-sea-derived microorganisms [16\u201320], the crude extract of Penicillium citrinum W17 isolated from a deep-sea sediment sample (\u22125278 m) of the western Pacific Ocean revealed the rich chemical diversity of the secondary metabolites. Therefore, it was subjected to a systematic chemical investigation. As a result, three new polyketides (penidihydrocitrinins A\u2013C, 1\u20133) and fourteen known compounds (4\u201317) were obtained (Figure 1).

The COSY correlations of 11-Me/H-3/H-4/12-Me, together with the HMBC correlations from H-4 to C-5 and C-10, from 13-Me to C-5, C-6, and C-10, from H-3 to C-10, and from H-1 to C-3, C-8, C-9, and C-10, constructed a dihydrocitrinin fragment. In combination with the HMBC cross peaks of 17-Me with C-16 and of 18-Me with C-1, C-15, and C16, the planar structure of compound 1 was established as 2-hydroxy-3-butonyldihydrocitrinin (Figure 2).\nThe correlations of H-3/12-Me and 11-Me/H-1/H-4 were observed in the NOESY spectrum, indicating H-1, H-4, and 11-Me were on the same plane, opposite to H-3 and 12-Me (Figure 2). Although the NOESY correlations were found of H-1 to 17-Me and 18-Me, revealing the relative configuration of C-15, more solid evidence is needed to confirm the absolute configuration because of the flexible structure of the segment. Accordingly, the theoretical calculations of the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectrum of (1S,3R,4S,15R)-1 and (1S,3R,4S,15S)-1 were conducted along with their enantiomers of (1R,3S,4R,15S)-1 and (1R,3S,4R,15R)-1. As shown in Figure 3, the calculated ECD spectrum of (1S,3R,4S,15R)-1 matched well with the experimental one. On the basis of the above evidence, compound 1 was determined as (1S,3R,4S,15R)-2-hydroxy-3-butonyldihydrocitrinin and named penidihydrocitrinin A. Compound 2 was obtained as a colorless oil. Its molecular formula was assigned as C17H22O7 on the basis of HRESIMS data at m/z 337.1348 [M \u2212 H]\u2212, suggesting seven degrees of unsaturation. Four methyls (\u03b4H 1.01 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 11-Me), 1.17 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 12-Me), 1.21 (d, J = 7.0 Hz, 18-Me), and 1.93 (s, 13-Me)) and four methines (\u03b4H 2.52 (m, H-4), 3.82 (qd, J = 6.6 Hz, 1.5 Hz, H-3), 4.11 (m, H-17), and 5.08 (d, J = 9.7 Hz, H-1)) were recognized in the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S9). The 13C NMR spectrum in association with the HSQC spectrum indicated 17 carbon signals ascribed to four methyls at \u03b4C 9.5 (q, 13-Me), 18.2 (q, 11-Me), 19.2 (q, 18-Me), and 20.1 (q, 12-Me); one methylene at \u03b4C 43.1 (t, C-15); four methines at \u03b4C 35.1 (d, C-4), 64.8 (d, C-1), 71.7 (d, C-3), and 72.2 (d, C-17); and eight nonprotonated carbons at \u03b4C 101.8 (s, C-7), 109.5 (s, C-5), 110.7 (s, C-9), 139.7 (s, C-10), 155.8 (s, C-8), 158.5 (s, C-6), 175.6 (s, C-14), and 211.9 (s, C-16). The spin systems of 11-Me/H3/H-4/12-Me, H-17/18-Me, and H-1/H-15 were observed in the COSY spectrum, constructing three segments (Figure 4). In the HMBC spectrum, correlations were found of 13-Me to C-5/C-6/C-10, 6-OH to C-5/C-6/C-7, 8-OH to C-7/C-8/C-9, H-4 to C-3/C-5/C-10/C-12, H1 to C-9/C-10/C-15/C-16, H-3 to C-1, and 18-Me to C-16/C-17. Taking the COSY and HMBC correlations together, the planar structure of compound 2 was then constructed as 3-hydroxy-2-butonyldihydrocitrinin, an isomer of 1. The relative configuration of 1 was regarded as the same as that of 2 on the basis of the key NOESY correlations of H-1/11-Me, H-3/12-Me, and H-4/11-Me (Figure 4). By the biosynthetic consideration, the absolute configuration of C-1, C-3, and C-4 in 2 and 1 should be the same. However, the\n.\nc rr l tions of H-3/12-Me and 11-Me/H-1/H-4 were observed in the NOESY spectrum, indicating -1, H-4, and 11-Me were on the same plane, opp site to H-3 and 12-Me (Figure 2).

While microglial cells function as the guardians of the central nervous system, their dysregulated activation can lead to chronic neuroinflammation and exacerbation of neuronal damage, contributing to the progression of disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases [36]. These diseases pose significant challenges to public health, which necessitate innovative therapeutic approaches. Thus, discovering new small molecules that can inhibit the dysregulated activation of microglial cells is essential for the targeted modulation of the immune response in the central nervous system, which can reduce inflammation and protect neurons from harm [37].

Notably, compound 14 (GKK1032 B) displayed the most potent nitrite inhibitory activity with an inhibitory ratio of 73.0 \u00b1 1.6% at 10 \u00b5M (nitrite concentration: 12.2 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5M), compared to the LPS-treated group (nitrite concentration: 30.9 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5M) (Figures 5 and 6). Furthermore, this compound displayed an IC50 value of 4.7 \u00b5M. Although GKK1032 analogues were reported to exhibit antibacterial activities [39], it is the first time that they had anti-neuroinflammatory activity. These findings demonstrate the effects of marine-derived compounds in modulating microglial activation, suggesting their potential as therapeutic candidates for neuroinflammatory conditions and neurodegenerative diseases.\nFigure 5.
