The elegant design of novel inhibitors of this process are presented and the crystal structures of the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 complex with a subset of phosphonate inhibitors are described, progressing research on the binding interactions of these inhibitors with the enzyme.\nSuccinyl phosphonate and adipoyl phosphonate are established as specific inhibitors of cognate 2-oxo acid dehydrogenases. The present work develops the action of triethyl esters of these compounds towards rats, by studying their membrane-penetrating abilities and influence on the rat brain metabolism (activity against chosen enzymes, influence on the level of certain amino acids), and animal behavior.\nThese papers alongside the articles previously published in the first volume (https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/13124/ phosphonate-chemistry-in-drug-design-and-development) of the series have indicated that the interest in synthesis and evaluation of biological activities of phosphonates is a substantial part of organophosphorus medicinal chemistry and that there is still a lot of space for valuable and interesting discoveries."
