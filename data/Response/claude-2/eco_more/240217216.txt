 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Develop new reinforcement learning algorithms tailored for cloud computing environments. The paper shows promise for RL in resource allocation, but more research can be done to design RL algorithms that take into account the unique challenges of cloud computing like dynamic workloads, heterogeneous resources, and multi-tenant environments. 

2. Investigate how to combine reinforcement learning with predictive modeling for cloud resource allocation. RL relies on trial-and-error which can be slow to converge. Integrating forecasting models to help guide RL exploration could improve learning efficiency.

3. Explore decentralized and distributed reinforcement learning approaches for resource management across multiple data centers/clouds. This could improve scalability and reliability compared to centralized control.

4. Evaluate new reward functions and constraints to optimize for objectives like energy efficiency, carbon footprint, and cost in addition to performance. This could help make cloud computing more sustainable.

5. Conduct real-world testing and implementation of RL-based resource management systems using commercial clouds like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Moving from simulation to real cloud environments poses challenges but is necessary before wide adoption.
