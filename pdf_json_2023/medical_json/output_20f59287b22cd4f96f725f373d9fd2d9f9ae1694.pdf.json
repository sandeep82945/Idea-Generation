    "abstractText": "Identifying and appropriately managing urinary tract infections (UTIs) among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are essential to reduce further disease complications and economic burden. Hence, this study aims to determine the prevalence of UTIs among CKD patients and study the antibiogram of the bacterial isolates. Four hundred eighty-two clean catch midstream urine samples were collected from CKD patients during the study period. The samples were cultured, and bacteria were isolated using standard microbiological techniques. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by the Kirby\u2013Bauer disc diffusion method following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Of the 482 CKD patients, 15.8% were culture positive, and the majority was elderly aged group population. Most bacterial isolates were Escherichia coli 50%, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 15.80%, Enterococcus species 15.80%, and Klebsiella pneumoniae 11.84%. The majority of bacteria were found to be resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin (94.67%), ceftriaxone (89.04%), cefotaxime (87.5%), and ceftazidime (84.0%), while polymyxin, colistin, vancomycin, meropenem, and imipenem were the most sensitive antibiotics. In our study, higher levels of antibiotic resistance were observed among urinary isolates. Therefore, our findings suggest clinicians to choose better antibiotic options to treat UTIs among CKD patients.",

            "text": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most frequent bacterial infection in clinical practice worldwide [1]. In addition, UTI is common in females, immunocompromised patients, diabetic population, incontinence with an indwelling catheter, and advanced age [2]. UTI is considered the most common and costly health-related problem worldwide. Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), Gram-positive bacteria (GPB), and some fungi are involved in the development of UTIs [3]. The organisms responsible for UTI are Enterobacteriaceae \u2013 Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter spp. and gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus spp. [4].\nThe main problem with current antibiotic therapies is the rapid emergence of resistance in hospitals and the community [5]. As a result, UTI patients may suffer from poor outcomes of their treatments due to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Resistance toward antibiotics could be natural (intrinsic) or due to genetic alterations [6]. AMR takes place when microorganisms show resistance to antimicrobial drugs that were previously effective. In the long term, AMR may cause an economic burden for patients, as it will raise healthcare costs through more extended hospital stays, leading to morbidity and mortality [7].

However, an alarming level of AMR develops in UTI pathogens due to the indiscriminate and widespread use of antibiotics resulting in multiand often pan-resistance. Therefore, it is essential to precisely monitor and manage the spread of resistance to lower the AMR\u2019s rising rate [8].\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a global public health problem. Patients with CKD and kidney failure are at high-risk for infectious complications, similar to patients with other types of acquired immune deficiencies or those treated with immunosuppressive drugs [9]. CKD patients are three timesmore at risk of infections than the general population [5]. Also, prolonged hemodialysis may compromise their immune system, making them vulnerable to disease, including UTIs. As a result, CKD may lead to recurrent UTIs and retrospective infection of the kidneys. In addition, chronic renal failure is a risk factor for developing UTIs due to metabolic disorders resulting in secondary immune alterations affecting many resistant components [10,11].\nMoreover, in patients with chronic renal failure, UTIs occur frequently after kidney transplantation [2,9]. However, there are limited studies on the clinical characteristics of UTI in CKD patients from Nepal. When administering empirical antibiotic therapy, knowledge of the common organisms and their antibiotic profiles is essential. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of bacteria causing UTIs and study their AMR pattern toward commonly used antibiotics among patients with different stages of CKD."

            "text": "CKD is considered a global public health burden, especially large in low- and middle-income countries [15]. Several risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, glomerulonephritis, urolithiasis, and polycystic kidney disease, have been found to be linked to the development of kidney failure [16]. Patients with CKD and kidney failure may be at high-risk for infections, similar to patients with acquired immune deficiencies. In addition, chronic renal failure is a risk factor for UTIs due to metabolic disorders resulting in secondary immune alterations affecting many immune components [9]. Despite the lack of data on the prevalence\nof UTI in CKD patients, some researchers think it might be comparable to the general population [17]. This study established that the prevalence of bacteria causing UTI among CKD patients was reasonably high (15.8%) compared to the survey done by Almaiman et al. [18]. Different other studies have reported variable rates of UTI prevalent among CKD patients [19,20].\nOur present study reported that the elderly population was associated with UTIs, and this result is consistent with\nresearch performed by Eshwarappa et al. and Manjunath et al. [5,21]. This result might be because elderly aged group were from advanced stages of CKD. Furthermore, the older age population showed urinary retention and excessive post-void residue, which is prone to the risk of UTIs. In addition, the most frequent causes of urinary stasis are prostate enlargement and autonomic neuropathy [22].\nIn this study, the prevalence of bacterial growth was high in males (16.7%) compared with the females (14.9%)\nthough it was not statistically significant. In contrast to our findings, several previous studies documented the high prevalence of UTI in females compared with males [23,24]. This could be due to the proximity of the anus to the warm urethral tube in females. Furthermore, the urethral tube of the females is short, which shortens the distance the organism moves to the bladder [25]. These predisposing factors of UTI are accelerated by limited resources, poor hygiene, and low socioeconomic status [26]. However, a study by Deltourbe et al. reported that both sexes experience an equal rate of UTI among old people. Anatomical factors are inadequate to explain the UTI prevalence in an older male population because men\u2019s urethral length does not alter with age. Instead, urodynamic alterations (such as prostatic enlargement in older men) or even cumulative biochemical or immunological abnormalities may be the reason for changes in the incidence of UTI in males [27]. Therefore, the male predominance of UTI in our study may be due to the higher percentage of elderly study participants.\nOur study demonstrated E. coli as the most prevalent bacterial uropathogen, with 38/76 (50%). This finding is comparable with other studies elsewhere in Nepal, indicating 50\u201380% of isolation of E. coli [19,28,29]. P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus were the second most isolated uropathogen with 12/76 (16%) frequency each. The high frequency of P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus is unique to this study. Previous studies in Kathmandu (Nepal) 2021 and Dhaka (Bangladesh) 2022 reported low rates of P. aeruginosa (8.7 and 4.4%, respectively) and Enterococcus (9.9\nand 6.4%, respectively) [30,31]. Although staphylococcal UTI was found to be more associated with increased use of bladder catheterization [23], our study reported lower rates of S. aureus (1%) isolated as uropathogen. Many other studies in different countries have reported a higher prevalence of S. aureus linked to UTI, from 5 to 15% [32\u201334]. The isolation of K. pneumoniae 9/76 (12%), Enterobacter 2/76 (3%), Citrobacter 1/76 (1%), and P. mirabilis 1/76 (1%) is in agreement with other studies by Odoki et al. in Uganda, Shakya et al. and Ganesh et al. from Nepal [23,30,35].\nAntibiotics are crucial in treating bacterial infections as long as the etiological bacteria are susceptible to antibiotic activity. Thus, determining accurate antibiotic susceptibility is essential in treating bacterial infections [36]. Bacteria capable of acquiring resistance demand more attention as antibiotic resistance is a growing concern in low and middle-low-income countries [30]. In our study, maximum numbers of bacterial isolates were resistant to ampicillin (94.67%), cefotaxime (87.5%), ceftriaxone (89.04%), ceftazidime (84.0%), ofloxacin (84.93%), and cotrimoxazole (69.56%), which is similar to the study by Shankar et al. [2]. Among the gram-negative isolates, majority of E. coli were found to be resistant to ampicillin (92.11%), cephalosporins (cefotaxime [86.48%], ceftriaxone [86.84%], ceftazidime [81.58%]) and ofloxacin (78.95%). Polymyxin b, colistin, meropenem, amikacin, and nitrofurantoin were the most susceptible antibiotics to E. coli. P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae showed similar resistivity as they were also conferred highest resistance to ampicillin, cephalosporins, cotrimoxazole, and ofloxacin. This antibiotic susceptibility result of gram-negative isolates is concurrent with the findings of research performed by Shakya et al. and Ganesh et al. [30,35]. The possible reason for the higher resistance toward commonly used antibiotics might be inappropriate use and under-dose administration in the community. Also, horizontal resistance gene transfer from the multidrug resistant isolates in hospitals and communities might increase resistance in these isolates [37].\nEnterococcus 15.8% (12/76) was the prevalent GPB in our study, whereas S. aureus was with minimal prevalence of 1% (1/76). Maximum numbers of Enterococcus were resistant to cefotaxime (100%), ceftriaxone (100%), ceftazidime (100%), ofloxacin (100%), ampicillin (91.67%), amikacin (81.82%), and gentamycin (75%). However, the most sensitive antibiotics were vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, nitrofurantoin, and cotrimoxazole. In S. aureus, all the isolates were resistant to tested antibiotics except nitrofurantoin, PIT, meropenem, and imipenem. In our study, vancomycin, linezolid, nitrofurantoin, and meropenem were the most susceptible antibiotics against the gram-positive isolates. These findings align with that reported by Bhargava et al. and\nMohapatra et al. from India (2022) [38,39]. This similarity might result from adopting similar antibiotic treatment recommendations for GPB in Nepal and India. Additionally, the species and strains of bacteria that are commonly found and cause diseases possibly are the reason for their concurrent resistance profile [6].\nDespite being a single hospital-based study, our present study has reported some significant findings that might be useful for clinicians and urologists to choose appropriate antibiotics. However, a nationwide surveillance study is needed among CKD patients in Nepal to generalize these results. In addition, we only analyzed the phenotypic characteristics of the bacteria. Therefore, all the findings need to be confirmed by advanced genotypic methods."

E. coli was the predominant bacteria responsible for UTI among CKD patients. All the isolated bacteria showed higher resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics in UTIs. This study recommends that, as CKD patients are immunocompromised, they can easily acquire the disease, and these resistant isolates can further worsen their health condition. To reduce the complicated infections and economic burden to CKD patients, routinely diagnosis of bacterial growth and their antibiogram would assist to prevent the burden of such infections. Therefore, our findings could help choose the correct antibiotics option to treat UTI among CKD patients.\nAbbreviations\nAMR antimicrobial resistance CKD chronic kidney disease PIT piperacillin\u2013tazobactam UTI urinary tract infection\nAcknowledgements: The authors acknowledge all the doctors, administrative staff, and laboratory personnel of the Department of Pathology, Sumeru Hospital, Lalitpur for their support in making all the data needed for the study.\nFunding information: This study was not funded by any funding agencies.\nAuthor contributions: T.B.T. drafted the study; V.K.S., O.S., and M.S. were involved in the sample collection process; T.B.T., V.K.S., O.S., and M.S. processed the sample and performed sample analysis; T.B.T., A.L., and S.P. performed the statistical analysis and data interpretation; T.B.T. and P.R.K. drafted the manuscript; T.B.T., A.L., S.P., M.S., and P.R.K. provided a critical manuscript revision.
