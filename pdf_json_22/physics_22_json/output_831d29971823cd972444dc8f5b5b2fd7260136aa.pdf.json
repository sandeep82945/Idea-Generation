            "text": "Particle irradiation is one of the most effective methods to enhance the critical current\ndensity (Jc) of superconductors. The enhancement of Jc has been demonstrated by many experiments in cuprate [1-7] and iron-based superconductors [8-14], and corresponding\nmechanisms have been proposed theoretically [15]. In addition, it has also been reported that\nthe artificial defects introduced by heavy-ion irradiations can act as disorder and suppress Tc [16-18]. However, most of the particle irradiation experiments have been conducted on\nunconventional high-temperature superconductors, with a few exceptions done on\nconventional superconductors. Among all the conventional superconductors, NbSe2 is one of such superconductors, on which effects of heavy-ion irradiations have been studied. For\nexample, the condition for the creation of columnar defects in NbSe2 has been discussed by irradiating samples with different energy of heavy-ions [19]. Dynamics of vortices [20,21],\nlock-in phenomenon [22], and vortex creep [23] in NbSe2 with columnar defects introduced\nby heavy-ion irradiations have been discussed. However, as far as we know, there have been\nno systematic study on how Tc is affected by heavy-ion irradiations in NbSe2.\nAs is known from the Anderson theorem, nonmagnetic disorder will not affect Tc if a superconductor has an isotropic s-wave gap structure [24]. Although NbSe2 is known to be an s-wave superconductor, thermal transport [25], angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n[26], and scanning tunneling microscope measurements [27] have revealed that it has an\nanisotropic s-wave gap structure, which means that nonmagnetic disorder can affect the Tc in NbSe2. For example, the disorder induced Tc suppression has been observed in a previous study about the effects of 2.5 MeV electron irradiation on NbSe2 [28]. However, a slight initial enhancement of Tc with increasing irradiation dose has also been observed before the Tc started to decline. The initial enhancement of Tc is attributed to the progressive suppression of charge-density wave (CDW) that competes with superconductivity. While CDW transition in\nNbSe2 is weak compared with other prominent CDW transitions such as observed in NbSe3 [29], the interplay between superconductivity and CDW makes interpretation of the\nirradiation effect in NbSe2 complex.\nOn the other hand, application of pressure is an effective way to explore the underlying\nproperties of a material (such as CDW and superconductivity). Actually, there have been\nmany studies reporting the enhancement of Tc in superconductors after the application of hydrostatic pressure [30-34]. At the same time, hydrostatic pressure always works to shrink\nthe lattice parameters [34-37]. These results indicate that the Tc enhancement can be attributed to the shrinkage of the lattice. In general, hydrostatic pressure can only provide positive\npressure on superconductors. However, if we can expand lattice, it is considered to be\nequivalent to negative pressure. Since it has been reported that particle irradiation can expand\nlattice in various materials [38-42], it is necessary to inspect the effect of heavy-ion irradiation\nto get some insight into the interplay between Tc suppression and the lattice expansion in NbSe2.\nIn the present paper, we report systematic studies on the suppression of Tc in NbSe2 upon heavy-ion irradiation and discuss how Tc is affected by the lattice expansion, disorder, and CDW."

            "text": "Single crystals of 2H-NbSe2 were prepared by the iodine vapor transport method [43]. Stoichiometric amounts of Nb powder (3N) and Se shot (5N), 2 g in total, were sealed in an evacuated quartz tube (16 mm inner diameter and 200 mm length) with 5 mg/cm 3 of iodine.\nThe evacuated quartz tube was kept in a tube furnace with a temperature gradient of ~50\u00b0C\n(high temperature at 800\u00b0C and low temperature at 750\u00b0C). The vapor transport process lasted\nfor two weeks, followed by furnace cooling.\nThe 320 MeV Au irradiation experiments were performed at JAEA in Tokai. The 800 MeV\nXe irradiations were performed at NIRS-HIMAC in Chiba. Before starting the irradiation\nexperiment, the single crystals were prepared to thin plates with a thickness less than 10 \u03bcm\nalong the c-axis, which is thinner than the projected range of 320 MeV Au and 800 MeV Xe\nirradiations for NbSe2 of \u223c17 \u03bcm and \u223c35 \u03bcm, respectively. The projected ranges are calculated by SRIM-2008 (the Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter-2008) [44]. For creating\ncolumnar defects parallel to the c-axis up to a dose equivalent matching field of B\u03a6 = 16 T, the incident ions were irradiated along the c-axis. In the case of 800 MeV Xe, some crystals were\nirradiated in a splayed fashion with splay angles of \u00b120\u00b0 from the c-axis to confirm the\npresence of columnar defects. The lattice parameters before and after the irradiation were\ncharacterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements using a commercial diffractometer\n(Smartlab, Rigaku) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation. The Bragg peaks other than (00l) peaks cannot be\ndirectly observed by using standard \u03c9-2\u03b8 scan (\u03c9: sample angle, 2\u03b8: detector angle) XRD\nmeasurements. According to the Laue equation, the condition for the constructive interference\nis\n\u0394k = kout - kin = G, (1)\nwhere kout, kin, and G are outgoing and incoming wave number of X-ray, and reciprocal lattice vector, respectively. To make (h0l) peaks observable, (h0l) reciprocal lattice point has to be\nbrought onto the Ewald sphere by rotating the crystal. Through successive optimizations of \u03c9\nand 2\u03b8, we can determine 2\u03b8 for (h0l) peaks, from which we can determine d-spacing for (h0l)\nplane. Before the calculation, we first fitted all Bragg peaks by using the extended Gaussian\nfunctions to account for the presence of two wave lengths of X-ray. The c lattice parameter is\ncalculated by taking an average value from (004), (006), and (008) peaks for better accuracy. For the calculation of a lattice parameter, we observed six equivalent (1010 _____ ) peaks and took\ntheir average. After determining diffraction angles, Bragg\u2019s law was used to calculate\ncorresponding d-spacings, which is related to a lattice parameter by the relation for the\nhexagonal lattice of\n 2 2 2 2 2 2 41 ,\n3\nh hk k l\nd a c\n    (2)\nwhere h, k, and l are Miller indices. The in-plane resistivity was measured by AC four-probe\nmethod using AC resistance bridge (LR700, Linear Research). For the magneto-optical (MO)\nmeasurement, an iron-garnet indicator film was placed in contact with the thin NbSe2 single crystal and cooled down with a He-flow cryostat (Microstat-HR, Oxford Instruments). The\nMO image was taken by using a cooled-CCD camera with 12-bit resolution (ORCA-ER,\nHamamatsu). Cross-sectional observations of the irradiated NbSe2 were performed with a high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL, JEM-3000F).\nMagnetization measurements were performed using a commercial SQUID magnetometer\n(MPMS-XL5, Quantum Design). The extended Bean critical state model [45] is used to estimate the Jc after measuring the magnetic hysteresis loops (MHLs). In this model Jc (A/cm 2 ) is given by\n c 20 ,\n1 3\nM J a b\na a\nb\n  \n     \n(3)\nwhere \u0394M (emu/cm 3 ) is the difference of magnetization when sweeping the external field\ndown and up. a (cm) and b (cm) are the width and length of the sample, respectively."

            "text": "Figure 1 (a) shows a TEM image of the 320 MeV Au irradiated NbSe2 single crystal with B\u03a6 = 8 T, where columnar defects with diameter of 6~8 nm are observed clearly. Figure 1 (b) shows a TEM image of a NbSe2 single crystal irradiated by 800 MeV Xe from two directions with \u03b8CD = \u00b120\u00ba from the c-axis, each with B\u03a6 = 2 T, where columnar defects are not so clear, but some faint traces of columnar defects with diameter of 4~6 nm are still observed. The\nreason why we put the TEM results on NbSe2 irradiated by 800 MeV Xe from two directions rather than those parallel to c-axis is to confirm that dark contrasts we observed here are really\nirradiation induced defects. The difference between the defect structures created by two kinds\nof ions with different energy can be explained by the difference in the stopping power of these\nions. The electronic stopping power Se has been used as one of reference conditions to predict whether the columnar defects can be created or not. Empirically, Se = 2 keV/\u00c5 is accepted as the threshold for the formation of columnar defects in cuprate superconductors [46]. Se value for 320 MeV Au irradiation and 800 MeV Xe irradiation into NbSe2 are calculated as Se = 3.27 keV/\u00c5 and Se = 2.74 keV/\u00c5 using SRIM-2008, and columnar defects were observed in both of these two cases. Previous studies on heavy-ion irradiations of 1 GeV Pb (Se = 3.98 keV/\u00c5) and 500 MeV I (Se = 2.78 keV/\u00c5) on NbSe2 single crystals also clarified the presence\nof columnar defects [19], while in the case of 230 MeV Ni (Se = 1.17 keV/\u00c5) irradiation on NbSe2, no columnar defects were found [19]. One point we need to note here is that no clear columnar defects were observed in NbSe2 irradiated by 340 MeV Xe (Se = 2.69 keV/\u00c5 > 2 keV/\u00c5) [19]. From these observations, we can conclude that the threshold for the creation of\ncolumnar defects in NbSe2 is close to Se = 2.7 keV/\u00c5. Figure 1 (c) shows an MO image of NbSe2 after the irradiation in the remanent state at T = 5 K. It shows the presence of a clear double-Y shaped current discontinuity line and confirms that uniform persistent current is\nflowing following the rectangular shape of the crystal. Actually, when a homogeneous\nrectangular superconductor is driven into the critical state, a uniform current parallel to the\nedge of the sample flows, forming a characteristic double Y-shaped current discontinuity lines\nas shown in Fig. 1 (d)."

As a reference, we also show (006) and (1010 _____ ) Bragg peaks for\nNbSe2 irradiated by 800 MeV Xe in Figs. 2 (c) and (d), respectively, where similar shifts of Bragg peaks are observed although their magnitudes are smaller compared with the case of\n320 MeV Au irradiation. Lattice parameters a and c, calculated by the method as described\nabove, as functions of B\u0424 are shown in Figs. 3 (a) and (b), respectively. For NbSe2 irradiated by 320 MeV Au, a and c increase linearly up to B\u0424 = 16 T at rates of 0.016%/T and 0.030%/T, respectively. Similarly, for NbSe2 irradiated by 800 MeV Xe, a and c increase linearly up to B\u0424 = 16 T at smaller rates of 0.0037%/T and 0.0038%/T, respectively. The lattice expansion for 800 MeV Xe irradiated samples is much smaller than that for 320 MeV Au irradiated\nsamples. The large difference is most probably originated from the different morphology of\nthe defects. As can be seen in Figs. 1 (a) and (b), clear columnar defects have been\nsuccessfully introduced in NbSe2 by 320 MeV Au irradiation, while only faint traces of columnar defects are observed in samples irradiated by 800 MeV Xe. Figs. 3 (c) and (d) are\nthe FWHM (full width at half maximum) values of XRD peaks for NbSe2 single crystals before and after the irradiations by 320 MeV Au and 800 MeV Xe. The FWHM shows almost\nno change after heavy-ion irradiations, which indicates that the lattice expands uniformly by\nirradiation. The reason why the lattice parameters expanded is because the amorphous\nmaterials created by rapid cooling of melted crystal have lower density with larger separation\nof constituent atoms. Due to expansion of the volume of columnar defects, surrounding lattice\nparts expand both along columnar defects and perpendicular to them. The expansion of the\nlattice parameters due to particle irradiations has also been widely observed in various\nmaterials such as La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 [38], CeO2 [39], MgB2 [40], YBa2Cu3O7\u2212y [41], and ErBa2Cu3O7 [42]. For example, the c-axis lattice parameter expansion in ErBa2Cu3O7 thin film has been reported at rates of 0.021%/T (3.8 GeV Ta irradiation), 0.050%/T (80 MeV I\nirradiation), 0.081%/T (200 MeV I irradiation), and 0.16%/T (120 MeV Au irradiation) [42].\nThese values compare well with 0.030%/T for 320 MeV Au irradiated NbSe2 crystals."

            "text": "The inset of Fig. 4 (a) shows M - T curves for NbSe2 irradiated by 320 MeV Au with different B\u03a6. It is clear that as B\u03a6 increases, Tc decreases monotonically. Figure 4 (a) shows the B\u0424 dependence of Tc in these samples, where Tc is determined by the onset of diamagnetism in M-T curves. As a reference, similar results obtained for 800 MeV Xe\nirradiated NbSe2 are also plotted [47]. Tc decreases significantly in NbSe2 after irradiation of 320 MeV Au. Such appreciable suppression of Tc upon introduction of columnar defects by 320 MeV Au looks strange since the defects are concentrated only along linear tracks leaving\nother area intact. One important fact that should be noted here is that during the process of\ncreation of columnar defects, energetic secondary electrons are generated and those electrons\ncan create atomic scale point defects, which are not easy to be observed by using TEM.\nHowever, there is another important factor that may affect Tc upon heavy-ion irradiations, which is the lattice expansion induced by the creation of columnar defects. As we mentioned\nin the last section, both a-axis and c-axis lattice parameters for NbSe2 after 320 MeV Au irradiation show monotonic increase. Namely, introduction of columnar defects via heavy-ion\nirradiation is equivalent to the application of negative pressure, which is not easy to realize in\na real material. Here, we try to compare the Tc variation by the lattice parameter change induced by heavy-ions irradiations and by pressure.\nTo calculate how much Tc is affected by lattice parameter change induced by irradiation, we\nseparate effects related to change in a-axis from that in c-axis. Based on the Ehrenfest relation,\nthe uniaxial pressure dependence of Tc can be calculated by\n c c 3 , , ,i i p dT V T i a b c dp C     (4)\nwhere V is the specific volume, i and pC are changes in thermal expansion coefficient\nand heat capacity across Tc [48]. Using experimental data of V, i , and pC for NbSe2,\ndTc/dpc = -0.145 K/kbar is calculated in Ref. [48], which is close to the experimental result of -0.14 K/kbar where the uniaxial pressure was applied parallel to the c-axis [49]. The\nhydrostatic pressure derivative of Tc is related to the uniaxial pressure derivative of Tc, and it can be written as\nc c c2 . a c dT dT dT dp dp dp   (5)\nBy using reported data of dTc/dpc [49] and dTc/dp for NbSe2 [35], c / adT dp is evaluated as\n0.100 K/kbar. In Ref. [35], linear isothermal compressibilities in the basal plane and along the c-axis are calculated as Ka = \u0394a/a/\u0394p = 4.1 (\u00b10.4) \u00d710 -4 /kbar and Kc = \u0394c/c/\u0394p = 16.2 (\u00b10.5) \u00d710 -4\n/kbar, respectively. By combining these Ka and Kc values with the lattice parameter data\nfor NbSe2 irradiated by 320 MeV Au at B\u03a6 = 16 T, Tc is expected to change -0.62 K (based on Ka) and 0.42 K (based on Kc), resulting in total Tc change of -0.82 K. This expected Tc suppression is smaller than the experimental value of -1.13 K. If we simply separate the effect\nof irradiation on Tc into that via lattice expansion and via disorder for NbSe2 irradiated by 320 MeV Au at B\u03a6 = 16 T, Tc variation induced by the disorder is -0.31 K. This suggests that Tc in NbSe2 after the introduction of columnar defects is mainly suppressed by lattice expansion rather than by disorder. Similar analyses for 800 MeV Xe irradiated NbSe2 (B\u03a6 = 16 T) give \u0394Tc (a-axis) = -0.14 K and \u0394Tc (c-axis) = 0.05 K, with total \u0394Tc of -0.23 K, which is close to the measured Tc change of -0.23 K. To confirm that the irradiation is properly done in samples irradiated by 800 MeV Xe, we show the Jc - H curves of the irradiated samples in Fig. 4 (b). It is clear that both 320 MeV Au and 800 MeV Xe irradiations enhance Jc significantly compared with the pristine sample. Then, it is also suggested that the effect of 800 MeV Xe\nirradiation on Tc in NbSe2 is dominated by the lattice expansion rather than disorder. However, since effects of 800 MeV Xe irradiation on both Tc and lattice expansion are much weaker than those of 320 MeV Au irradiation, studies on samples with much larger B\u03a6 are necessary to confirm the effect of negative pressure more quantitatively.\nIt should be note that there is additional complication in the case of 2H-NbSe2 to discuss the variation of Tc by any perturbation, which is the presence of CDW. It is commonly observed that in superconductors with competing CDW, suppression of CDW will help to\nenhance the superconductivity. Because the Fermi surface is used to form both\nsuperconductivity and CDW, if the CDW is suppressed and a part of the gapped Fermi surface\ncan be released, this part of Fermi surface will be used to enhance the superconductivity. For\nexample, the competition between CDW and superconductivity has been studied by applying\nhydrostatic pressure in Lu5Ir4Si10 [50], CsV3Sb5 [51] as well as NbSe2 [30]. The competition between CDW and superconductivity has also been observed in terms of particle irradiation in\nNbSe2 [28] and Lu5Ir4Si10 [52]. Figure 5 (a) shows the \u03c1-T curves for a pristine NbSe2 single crystal and that after irradiated by 320 MeV Au with B\u03a6 = 2 T, where Tc is suppressed from 7.15 K to 7.04 K, and at the same time TCDW is suppressed from 33 K to 30 K. For the sample irradiated by 320 MeV Au with B\u03a6 = 2 T, the global feature of \u03c1-T curve and the value of resistivity (\u03c1(8 K) = 7 \u03bc\u03a9\u00b7cm) and TCDW (~30 K) are similar to that irradiated by 2.5 MeV electron with a dose of 0.47 C/cm 2 , \u03c1(8 K) = 7.5 \u03bc\u03a9\u00b7cm and TCDW (~30 K) [28]. However, in the latter case, Tc was increased to 7.45 K.\nTo discuss why the initial Tc enhancement is not observed in NbSe2 irradiated by 320 MeV Au, one factor that needs to be considered is the sample quality. It has been reported that the\nCDW transition is sensitively affected by the sample quality [53]. If the sample itself has\nenough impurities that already suppressed the Tc, the resistivity value of the pristine sample should be large, which is not the case as we pointed out above. Furthermore, residual\nresistivity ratio (RRR) value of \u03c1(300 K)/\u03c1(8 K) = 50.7 of the pristine sample used in the\npresent experiment is very similar to that used in Ref. [28]. These facts indicate that the\nabsence of initial Tc enhancement here is not related to the sample quality. Another possible explanation is that the enhanced Tc by suppression of CDW in the heavy-ion irradiated sample is smaller compared to the total effects from lattice expansion and disorder. As shown\nschematically in Fig. 5 (b), Tc is monotonically suppressed by the lattice expansion as discussed above. The degree of disorder should also be proportional to B\u03a6, which induces a monotonic suppression of Tc with increasing B\u03a6. For the effects of CDW, it initially enhances Tc. However, after CDW is completely suppressed at B\u03a6 * , the effect of CDW on Tc does not change. By the combination of all these three factors, Tc will continuously decrease with increasing B\u03a6. Whether we have reached B\u03a6 * or not in the present study needs confirmation by resistivity and/or low-temperature X-ray measurements. If the Tc suppression via lattice expansion is negligible in the case of high-energy electron irradiation, a weak initial\nenhancement of Tc can be realized as observed in Ref. [28]. Weaker effects of high-energy electron irradiation to the lattice is quite probable considering the fact that created defects are\nmainly Frenkel pairs which are supposed to affect the lattice only weakly."

The lattice parameters a and c are found to be expanded with\nincreasing B\u03a6. This lattice expansion can be considered to be equivalent to the negative pressure to the lattice. When the effects of 320 MeV Au irradiation on Tc are separated into that via lattice expansion and that via disorder, Tc is found to be affected more by lattice expansion rather than disorder. However, the presence of CDW in NbSe2 makes this interpretation of the effect of irradiation on Tc complicated. To avoid this complication, we are planning to do similar measurements in 2H-NbS2 that shows superconductivity around 6.0 K but does not form CDW at any temperatures."
