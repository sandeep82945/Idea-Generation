    "abstractText": "Protective layers are essential for Si-based photocathodes to achieve longterm stability. The conventionally used inorganic protective layers, such as TiO2, need to be free of pinholes to isolate Si from corrosive solution, which demands extremely high-quality deposition techniques. On the other hand, organic hydrophobic protective layers suffer from the trade-off between current density and stability. This paper describes the design and fabrication of a discontinuous hybrid organic protective layer with controllable surface wettability. The underlying hydrophobic layer induces the formation of thin gas layers at the discontinuous pores to isolate the electrolyte from Si substrate, while allowing Pt co-catalyst to contact the electrolyte for water splitting. Meanwhile, the surface of this organic layer is modified with hydrophilic hydroxyl groups to facilitate bubble detachment. The optimized photocathode achieves a stable photocurrent of 35mA/cm for over 110 h with no trend of decay.",

The conventionally used inorganic protective layers, such as TiO2, need to be free of pinholes to isolate Si from corrosive solution, which demands extremely high-quality deposition techniques. On the other hand, organic hydrophobic protective layers suffer from the trade-off between current density and stability. This paper describes the design and fabrication of a discontinuous hybrid organic protective layer with controllable surface wettability. The underlying hydrophobic layer induces the formation of thin gas layers at the discontinuous pores to isolate the electrolyte from Si substrate, while allowing Pt co-catalyst to contact the electrolyte for water splitting. Meanwhile, the surface of this organic layer is modified with hydrophilic hydroxyl groups to facilitate bubble detachment. The optimized photocathode achieves a stable photocurrent of 35mA/cm2 for over 110 h with no trend of decay.\nConverting solar energy into chemical fuels, such as hydrogen, is a sustainable way to relieve energy and environmental issues1. Silicon (Si)2, various metal oxides3, and III-V semiconductors4,5 have been studied for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Among them, Si is one of the most attractive candidates for PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its low cost, suitable bandgap, and band edge position6. However, Si is susceptible to deactivation in aqueous solutions7\u20139. To construct a stable Si-based photocathode, the prevailing strategy is to introduce a compactmetallic layer or metal oxide layer by sputtering10 or atomic layer deposition (ALD)11 on the Si surface to isolate Si from the electrolyte. Thus, this compact protective layer is required to be transparent12, conductive13, and chemically stable14 to enable a durable and efficient photocathode15. TiO2 films formed by ALD have been extensively employed as protective layers for PEC electrodes16\u201318. However, TiO2 will become unstable at very negative potentials19 or under UV illumination20. Meanwhile, previous studies found that ALD-grown TiO2 required a minimum thickness of 50 nm to becomepinholes-free in a strict sense, due to the presence of atmospheric particulatematter on the substrate in a normal laboratory environment21\u201325. Additionally, pitting corrosion corresponded to pinholes was also demonstrated26. Thus, the traditional isolation strategy that requires a pinholes-free layer imposes a limitation on material selection and deposition method. Therefore, there is a need to develop strategies27 that could diminish Si-liquid contact with acceptable tolerance for pinholes in the protective layer. In addition to isolating Si substrate from electrolyte with a dense protective layer, it is also possible to decrease the Si-liquid contact by increasing the hydrophobicity of Si to delay the transport of liquids near the surface28, which might decrease the rate of corrosion29,30. However, decreasing Si-liquid contact will also diminish the active area for water splitting reactions. Moreover, previous studies observed that most hydrophobic layers were\nReceived: 14 October 2021\nAccepted: 11 July 2022\nCheck for updates\n1School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China. 2Key Laboratory for Green Chemical Technology of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China. 3Purification Equipment Research Institute of Handan, Handan, Hebei 056000, China. 4Joint School of National University of Singapore and Tianjin University, International Campus of Tianjin University, Binhai New City, Fuzhou 350207, China. 5These authors contributed equally: Bo Wu, Tuo Wang. e-mail: jlgong@tju.edu.cn\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4460 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\npoorly conductive31,32, while hydrophobic electrodes exhibited vastly lowered HER activities than wettable electrodes33,34. The poor performance of hydrophobic electrodes could be attributed to the fact that a large amount of gas would grow into big bubbles on the surface during the HER35\u201337, which would cause a current drop due to the covering of active sites of the HER catalysts38. Therefore, it is highly desired but still challenging to use a hydrophobic layer as the protective layer while preventing the bubble covering over cocatalysts to achieve efficient surface reactions.\nThis study describes the design and fabrication of a discontinuous protective layer with controllable surface wettability, where a bottom organic hydrophobic layer is modified with surface hydrophilic hydroxyl groups to form thin gas layers to isolate the electrolyte from the corrosion-vulnerable Si substrateswhile suppressing the formation of big bubbles. By optimizing the pore sizes of the hydrophobic layer, discrete thin gas layers will form in the pores to isolate the exposed Si from the corrosive solutions, while allowing HER co-catalyst Pt to contact the electrolyte to maintain a high photocurrent. Under the protection of this organic layer deposited by a spin-coating method, the photocathode achieves a saturation current of 35mA/cm2 with a stable operation for 110 h without performance deterioration, which is comparable to metal oxide-based protective layers prepared by vacuum deposition techniques."

            "text": "PEC performances of Si-photocathodes with the organic protective layers For electrode fabrication (details in Fig. S1), an ordinary pyramidpn+-Si substrate (Fig. S2) was used as a model sample to establish the relationship between performance and surface wettability, which exhibits a stable and reproducible photovoltage of 0.55V. It is known that organosilane, such as Si(O-CH3)3-(CH2)17-CH3 (TMOS), presents a suitable surface tension39,40. At the same time, the thickness of organosilane can be controlled on a nanometer scale, with structures varied from self-assembly monolayer to multilayer by changing the deposition conditions41. Furthermore, the structure or surface functional group of organosilane is sensitive to temperature42,43. Thus, it is possible to fabricate an organosilane layer with a controllable thickness and structure to enable efficient electron transport. Therefore, TMOS is selected to increase the hydrophobicity of the substrate. By optimizing the speed of spin-coating and the temperature of hydrolysis and condensation steps, TMOS could be feasibly modified to a discontinuous layer with controllable pore sizes (200nm to 1 \u00b5m), while the thickness is maintained at around 5 nm (thickness was obtained from the planar p++-Si/TMOS sample) to achieve a high photocurrent with high stability (Figs. 1a, S2 and S3). The nanoporousmorphology of the solution-processed TMOS layer may be closely related to the removal of ethanol and water during the 120 \u00b0C curing process44. The side view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that there is no difference between the pyramid pn+-Si and pn+-Si/TMOS samples (Fig. S4), revealing that the TMOS layer will not coalesce together, nor accumulate at the bottom of the pyramid arrays. Even though the ultrathin TMOS film cannot be directly observed on the Si pyramid from side view SEM (Fig. S4) or cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. S5) images, it is still possible to conclude the existence of a surface layer on the Si pyramid surface. The top view energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt shows that the C element is distributed evenly upon the pyramid pn+-Si. At the same time, the content of the C element is increased to 24.4% from 2.3% upon the introduction of TMOS layer\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4460 2\n(Fig. S6). Furthermore, the contact angle is increased to 110\u00b0 from 65\u00b0 (Fig. S2). These results confirm that the TMOS layer indeed exists on the pyramid surface.\nWith homogeneously distributed single clusters of Pt (8 s sputtering, details in SI) as the HER co-catalyst (Figs. S6\u2013S8), which lowers the activation energy (overpotential) for the HER45. The currentpotential (J\u2013V) characteristics show that the optimizedpn+-Si/TMOS/Pt exhibits an improved PEC activity comparedwith the pn+-Si/Pt sample, whichmay bedue to the decreased charge recombination upon TMOS passivation (Figs. 1b and S9). Specifically, the pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt photocathode achieves a saturation photocurrent density of 32.5mA/cm2. Apart from the better PEC activity, the pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt photocathode exhibits much stronger stability. The photocurrent of unprotected pn+-Si/Pt photocathode decays quickly within 3 h due to the formation of SiO2 (Figs. 1c and S10)\n20. Photocathode with the structure of pn+-Si/ TMOS/Pt shows almost 22% decreased photocurrent after 8 h. However, it can recover its original photocurrent after being taken out of the electrolyte and put back immediately to remove the accumulated gas bubbles, leading to stability for over 110 h by repeating this bubble removal operation every 8 h (Fig. 1c). Similar current drops during the stability tests were also observed in previously reported photocathode with a structure of pn+-Si/Ti/TiO2/Pt or pn +-Si/MoS2 46,47. However, the mechanisms might be different. Previous studies attributed the decrease of the photocurrent to the contamination of Pt co-catalysts46 or the elevated temperature47. Therefore, co-catalysts or electrolytes were replaced to recover the original performance. However, no extra treatments were needed in this study. The photocathode was simply taken out of the electrolyte, and then submerged into the electrolyte immediately (within 60 s) every 8 h during the stability test. The photocurrent can reconvert to the original level, by which it can be inferred that bubble accumulation is the reason for the photocurrent drop in our case.\nTo eliminate the current drop caused by bubble accumulation, trimethylaluminum (TMA) molecules were introduced on the surface of the hydrophobic layer to alter the surface wettability of the TMOS layer. Al 2p peak appeared in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of the pn+-Si/W-TMOS sample, which demonstrates that TMA adsorbed onto the TMOS layer (Fig. S11)48. As a result, a wettable TMOS layer (denoted as W-TMOS) can be obtained after ambient exposure, where the water molecules from the ambient will convert surface adsorbed TMA into -Al-OH groups (without H2O dose in the ALD chamber), leaving a -OH terminated hydrophilic surface (Figs. S12 and S13). It should be noted that this surface treatment only involves the repeated dosing of TMA without dosing water, which is different from ALD processes. The optimized cycle number of TMA dosing is determined according to the photocathode performance, which presents a volcanic trend with the increasing cycle numbers (Fig. S14). Photocathode pn+-Si/W-TMOS/Pt achieves a saturation photocurrent density of 35mA/cm2 with an applied bias photo-tocurrent efficiency (ABPE) of 8%, surpassing pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt and pn+-Si/Pt photocathodes (Fig. S15). This PEC performance is also comparable to other metal oxides protective layers-based photocathodes (Table S1). The high efficiency of pn+-Si/W-TMOS/Pt photocathode is supported by much higher incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), as compared to that of pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt (Fig. S16a). To investigate the optical effect of the samples, a calibrated photodiode (Thorlabs, FDS100-CAL) was used tomeasure the intensity of reflected light from the pyramid Si samples with a different protective layer and different gas evolving conditions in the electrolyte (details in SI, Fig. S16d). The result shows that the hydrophobic TMOS layer induces additional reflective interfaces, with the reflectivity increasing to 10.2% from 7.8% compared to bare Si. Furthermore, the accumulated large bubbles on the TMOS layer will further increase the reflectivity to 13.7%. On the contrary, the hydrophilic W-TMOS sample exhibits a reduced reflectivity to 4.7%, and the small bubbles on the pyramid\npn+-Si/W-TMOS/Pt surface only bring an extra reflectivity of 0.9% (Figs. S16b, c). Thus, the enhanced IPCE obtained by pyramidpn+-Si/WTMOS/Pt over pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt might be attributed to the suppressed light reflectivity owing to the hydrophilic surface that suppresses the accumulation of gas bubbles. The Faradaic efficiency for H2 of pn+-Si/W-TMOS/Pt photocathode is above 97%, indicating the efficient conversions of photoelectrons to H2 (Fig. S17). All PEC results indicate that the optimized W-TMOS and TMOS layers will not affect the electron transfer. Furthermore, the PEC performances demonstrate that optimized W-TMOS and TMOS layers do not affect the light transmittance. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy results show that TMOS and W-TMOS layers are transparent at the optimized thickness of 5 nm. However, 50nm TiO2, the thickness required for a pinholesfree layer, absorbs at least 20% of the incident light at 200\u2013800nm wavelength (Fig. S18). Additionally, the pn+-Si/W-TMOS/Pt photocathode achieves stability above 110 h (Figs. 1c, S19 and S20). Under the simulated realistic operational condition (8 h simulation and 16 h dark, repeated), the optimized pyramid pn+-Si/W-TMOS/Pt also achieves long-term stability above 110 h, which demonstrates that this surface modification method is effective on materials subjected to intermittent illumination (details in SI). These results reveal that the facile spin-coating-based organic protective layer indeed achieves long-term stability, which is comparable to the inorganic protective layer deposited by vacuum deposition techniques.\nElectron transportation through the organic protective layer TMOS is a poorly conductive material31,32. Furthermore, the thickness of theTMOS layer is about 5 nm,which is too thick to allowelectrons to tunnel through49. Thus, the electron transportmechanismthrough this organic layer needs to be further explored. The optimization process indicates that the formation temperature of TMOS layer largely affects the performances of photocathodes. To further investigate the electron transfer pathway across these organic layers, TMOS were deposited at various temperatures (30\u2013150 \u00b0C) on planar p++-Si instead of the pyramid pn+-Si. The planar substrate provides a simplified structure of thin organic layers with a thickness on the nanometer scale. A dummy solution (ethanol and water only) without TMOS was also spin-coated onto the planar p++-Si surface to form a control sample. After that, these electrodes were heated under 90 \u00b0C and 120 \u00b0C, respectively. The control samples were denoted as p++-Si (90 \u00b0C) and p++-Si (120 \u00b0C). The p++-Si (90 \u00b0C), p++-Si (120 \u00b0C), and p++-Si samples exhibit similar onset potential and slope for the HER, which demonstrates that thebaking temperaturewill not induce the oxidation of the Si surface (Fig. 2a). J\u2013V tests show that samples of planar p++-Si/TMOS (below 110 \u00b0C) present low current density. However, TMOS film heated under 120 \u00b0Cor 150 \u00b0C exhibits similarperformancewithplanar p++-Si, which indicates that temperature can increase the electron transfer efficiency. The optimized TMOS layer discussed below was deposited at 120 \u00b0C, while the TMOS layer formed under a higher temperature (150 \u00b0C) is denoted as TMOS (HT). Additionally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results show the smaller arc radius of p++-Si/TMOS samples baked under higher temperatures, which also proves that the electrodes formed under higher temperatures show faster electron transfer (Fig. 2b).\nQuantitative in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fouriertransform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and Raman spectroscopy did not show any evidence of conductive functional groups50 or conductive materials51 formed in Si/TMOS at elevated temperature (Fig. S21). These results reveal that increased temperature does not change the chemical structure of TMOS. Thus, increased temperature makes no noticeable influence on the intrinsic conductivity of the TMOS layer. SEM image indicates increased pore size and density with increasing temperature (Fig. 3). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images also reveal that there are some pores in the TMOS layer (Fig. S22). That is because high temperatures would\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4460 3\naccelerate the hydrolysis and condensation of TMOS, making it a disordered film42. Therefore, it could be concluded that the main difference between TMOS layers formed under different temperatures is the size and density of the pores, which may influence the transfer of electrons.\nSEM results show that the optimized pore sizes of the TMOS layer are ~1 \u00b5m, while the optimized sizes of Pt particles are ~10 nm (Fig. S7). Therefore, the Pt particles can contact Si in the pores of the TMOS layer. Furthermore, the measured photogenerated minority carrier diffusion length of pn+-Si substrate used in this study is above 117 \u00b5m, while the distance between adjacent pores in the TMOS layer is less than 10 \u00b5m. This makes it possible for electrons generated under covered Si to transfer laterally to exposed Si at pores, where Pt particles contact Si for theHER. The cyclic voltammogram result shows that the pyramid pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt electrode exhibits a much higher redox peak current than pn+-Si/TMOS (Fig. S24a). The J\u2013V curves also show that the onset potential shifts positively by about 1 V upon the deposition of Pt particles when H+/H2 or aqueousmethyl-viologen was adopted as the redox couple (Figs. S24b and S25b). These results demonstrate that optimized Pt particles enhance the electron transfer across resistive TMOS interfaces by forming a conduction path of Si/ Pt/electrolyte52\u201355. The open circuit potential versus time of pyramid pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt photocathode in the dark and under AM 1.5G illumination shows that the photovoltage of pyramid pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt photocathode is about 0.55V, which is similar with the voltage obtained by pyramid pn+-Si/TMOS (Fig. S25c). This result reveals that Pt deposition will not pin the band edges of Si to the Si/Pt defect site and the photovoltage is primarily determined by the pn junction. Furthermore, J\u2013V curves of pyramid pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt photocathode under different solutions with different pH show that the V(onset) values do not change with pH (Fig. S25a). However, when the aqueous H+/H2 is\nchanged to aqueous methyl-viologen as a redox couple, the V(onset) shifts negatively from 0.55V to ~0.25 V (Figs. S25b and S26b). These results demonstrate that the Pt deposition will not result in the Fermi level pinning.\nDark solid J\u2013V measurements of pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt sample at various temperatures show an ohmic contact conduction mechanism (Figs. 2c, S23, and Table S2), which confirms that electrons transfer through Si/Pt interface directly. Furthermore, J\u2013V curves of pyramid pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt show that photocathodes protected by TMOS with different chain lengths (12, 16, or 18 carbons, denoted as 12 C, 16 C, or 18 C) exhibit similar PEC performance (Fig. S26a). This is due to the fact that the polymer based on 12 C or 16 C remains poorly conductive since it does not contain any conductive functional group or conductive materials. The electrons cannot transfer across these resistive interfaces, leaving Si/Pt contacts in the pores as the only electron transfer pathway. However, polymers with a shorter chain length exhibit reduced photocathode stability (Fig. S26b). Thus, it could be concluded that the promoted electron transfer efficiency is indeed due to the formation of the Si/Pt ohmic contacts in the larger pores of the TMOS layer formed under high temperatures. Apart from the enhanced electron transfer with the Pt deposition, Pt particles lower the kinetics barrier for the HER. J\u2013V curves show that pyramid pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt achieves a steeper slop than pn+-Si/TMOS, when aqueous H+/H2 is adopted as that redox couple. This result is also consistent with the J\u2013V curves of planar p++-Si/TMOS and p++-Si/TMOS/Pt (Fig. 2a). Moreover, planar p++-Si/TMOS/Pt and p++-Si/Pt electrodes show the same onset potential and current density (Fig. 2a). This result may demonstrate that the optimized Si/TMOS/Pt exhibits sufficient active site for the HER by forming Si/Pt contact in the pores of the discontinuous layer.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4460 4\nProtection mechanism of the discontinuous organic protective layer It is generally accepted that pinholes in inorganic hydrophilic protective layers, such as oxides, would lead to a decreased stability due to the exposed Si substrate contacting corrosive electrolyte directly46. However, the photocathode protected by the optimized discontinuous organic hydrophobic protective layer exhibits great stability in this study. Thus, a different protectionmechanism is proposed by which the discontinuous TMOS protects the Si with a finely controlled gas layer formation process. The covered part of Si will be protected by TMOS, while it is suspected that the exposed Si might be isolated from corrosive solution through the formation of thin gas layers, while the gas layer should be thin enough to allowPt particles to penetrate through this layer to contact with the electrolyte for a large photocurrent.\nTo prove this hypothesis, computational fluid dynamic simulations (CFD) were used to analyze the solid-liquid-gas contact state for different electrodes. The simulation result reveals the formation of a continuous gas layer above the surface of the hydrophilic layer (Fig. S27). This result indicates that exposed Si can be protected by the continuous gas layer. At the same time, the CFD result on the nanometer scale shows that a thin gas layer, with a thickness <7 nm, forms above the surface of the exposed Si on the planar Si/TMOS electrode. This result reveals that the Pt nanoparticles with a size of 10 nm can penetrate through this gas layer to contact the electrolyte for a large photocurrent. However, the exposed Si will contact the electrolyte directly for planar Si without the protection of the TMOS layer (Figs. 3b and S27). In other words, the thin gas layer may protect Si from corrosion without affecting the HER. Furthermore, the simulation result\nalso demonstrates the influence of the wettability of exposed Si on the formation of the thin gas layer at the micrometer scale (Figs. S27 and S28), where the contact angle of the exposed Si was decreased to 50\u00b0 from 65\u00b0 (Fig. S2). The simulation result shows that the increased wettability of the exposed Si at pores will not affect the formation of the continuous gas layer, when the pore sizes of the TMOS remain constant (Fig. S28). The result demonstrates that the thin gas layer is also the reason for the long stability of the pn+-Si/W-TMOS/Pt photocathode. However, when the electrodes are not coated by the TMOS layer or when the pore size is larger than 5 \u00b5m, simulation results show that Si contacts the electrolyte directly (Figs. 3a, c). Thus, the Si will be corroded, which is the main reason for the poor stabilities of pn+-Si/Pt and pn+-Si/TMOS (HT)/Pt photocathodes.\nImpact of bubbles on the performance drop Though TMOS and W-TMOS coated photocathodes share the same protection strategy, they exhibit drastically different bubble growth kinetics, which attributes to their different surface wettability. The contact angle of pn+-Si/TMOS/Pt electrode is 80\u00b0 (Inset of Fig. 4a). Thus, as-formed gas adheres strongly to the TMOS layer. It was found that only large bubbles were released from the electrode surfacewhile the smaller bubbles continued to grow during the HER (Movie S1 and inset of Fig. 4c). Furthermore, the simulation result indicates that bubbles coalesce with adjacent bubbles before detachment (Figs. 4a and S29). Such growth and release behaviors of the large bubbles result in decreased effective reaction areas. Therefore, while photocathode protected by TMOS allows the possibility of achieving longterm stability, it suffers from the current drop caused by the bubble accumulation (Fig. 4c).\ntrolyte 0%), while the blue color represents an H2 volume fraction of 0% (electrolyte 100%).\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:4460 5\nThe situation result is drastically different when W-TMOS is used as a protective layer. With the modification of hydrophilic hydroxyls groups on the top of TMOS, the surface of pn+-Si/WTMOS/Pt becomes more hydrophilic, with the contact angle decreased to 50\u00b0 (Inset of Fig. 4b). It was observed that the pn+-Si/ W-TMOS/Pt photocathode exhibited a quick bubble detachment during the stability test (Movie S2 and inset of Fig. 4d), which is consistent previous work56. Additionally, the simulation result proves that the bubble growth is limited when the wettability is increased (Fig. 4b), which leads to high performance with longterm stability (Fig. 4d)57. Therefore, the wettable organic layer will isolate the electrolyte from the corrosion-vulnerable substrates, while accelerating the detachment of gas bubbles. Consequently, a stable and effective Si-based photocathode can be constructed."

            "text": "A facile and reliable method for resolving the trade-off between efficiency and stability of the organic protective layer is demonstrated by constructing a discontinuous organic layer with adjustable surface wettability. By optimizing the pore size of the organic layer, the discrete thin gas layers will form in the pores to isolate the exposed Si from the electrolyte to achieve long-term stability, while Pt co-catalyst penetrates through the gas layer to contact the electrolyte to maintain a high photocurrent. Furthermore, the hydrophilic W-TMOS layer also decreases the light reflectivity by suppressing bubble accumulation compared with a hydrophobic surface. Under the protection of W-TMOS layer, the Si photocathode achieves a high ABPE of 8% in strongly acidic electrolyte without any degradation over a duration of 110 h. The relationship between the wettability of the photoelectrode and performance in this work may provide a general strategy for altering the instability and bubble problems of photocathodes for the HER. Furthermore, more research endeavors might be needed to investigate the relationship between the thickness of the organic layer and the PEC performance."
