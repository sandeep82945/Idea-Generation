Zhukova\n(Belle Collaboration)\n(Received 24 June 2022; accepted 3 February 2023; published 27 February 2023)\nWe study the decay B\u00fe \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212\u03c0\u00fe and investigate the angular distribution of K\u00feK\u2212 pairs with invariant mass below 1.1 GeV=c2. This region exhibits both a strong enhancement in signal and very large direct CP violation. We construct a coherent sum model for the angular distribution of the S- and P-wave, and report the ratio of their amplitudes, the relative phase and the forward-backward asymmetry. We also report absolute differential branching fractions and direct CP asymmetry for the decay in bins of MK\u00feK\u2212 and the differential branching fractions in bins of MK\u00fe\u03c0\u2212 . The results are based on a data sample that contains 772 \u00d7 106 BB\u0304 pairs collected at the \u03d2\u00f04S\u00de resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e\u00fee\u2212 collider. The result favors the presence of S- andD-waves in lowMK\u00feK\u2212 region to the detriment of a P-wave.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.107.032013\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCharmless decays of B mesons are suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) and thus provide an opportunity to search for physics beyond the SM through branching fraction enhancements. Large CP asymmetries can occur in these decays due to interference of SM tree and loop diagramswith similar amplitudes; there is also the possibility of beyond-SM particles contributing in the loop diagrams.

The dominant process is the Cabibbosuppressed b \u2192 u tree transition in Fig 1(a); the b \u2192 d penguin diagram in Fig. 1(d) leading toB\u00fe \u2192 \u03d5\u03c0\u00fewith\u03d5 \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212 is heavily suppressed, and the current experimental limit for this mode is B\u00f0B\u00fe \u2192 \u03d5\u03c0\u00fe\u00de < 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 [2]. An unidentified structure has been observed byBABAR [3] and LHCb [4\u20136] in the K\u00feK\u2212 low-invariant-mass spectrum of theB\u00fe \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212\u03c0\u00fe decay. The LHCb studies also found a nonzero integrated CP asymmetry of \u22120.123 0.022 and a large local CP asymmetry in the same mass region. References [7,8] suggest that final-state interactions may enhance CP violation, and the recent LHCb study suggests that the largeCP asymmetry in the low-K\u00feK\u2212 invariant-mass region originates from \u03c0\u03c0 \u2194 KK S-wave rescattering [6]. Building on our earlier shorter publication [9], this paper studies the angular distribution of the K\u00feK\u2212 system in the low-invariant-mass region and quantifies the CP asymmetry and branching fraction as a function of the K\u00feK\u2212 invariant mass and the branching fraction as a function of the K\u2212\u03c0\u00fe invariant mass.We employ a reoptimized binning close to the kinematic boundaries of the K\u00feK\u2212 and K\u2212\u03c0\u00fe systems. This paper also includes the full description of the analysis of the branching fraction and direct CP asymmetry measurement previously published in Ref. [9]. The data were collected with the Belle detector at the KEKBasymmetric-energy (3.5on8GeV) e\u00fee\u2212 collider [10]. The data sample consists of 772 \u00d7 106 BB\u0304 pairs accumulated at the \u03d2\u00f04S\u00de resonance, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 711 fb\u22121, and an additional 89 fb\u22121 of offresonance data recorded at a center-of-mass (c.m.) energy about 60 MeV below the \u03d2\u00f04S\u00de resonance."

            "text": "The Belle detector consists of a silicon vertex detector (SVD), a 50-layer central drift chamber (CDC),\ntime-of-flight scintillation counters (TOF), an array of aerogel threshold Cherenkov counters (ACC), and a CsI (Tl) electromagnetic calorimeter located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5 T magnetic field. Outside the coil, the K0L and muon detector, composed of resistive plate counters, detects K0L mesons and identifies muons. The detector is described in detail elsewhere [11]. The dataset used in this analysis was collected with two different inner detector configurations. A data sample corresponding to 140 fb\u22121 was collected with a beam pipe of radius 2 cm and with three layers of SVD, while the rest of the data were collected with a beam pipe of radius 1.5 cm and four layers of SVD [12]. A GEANT3-based [13] Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the Belle detector is used to optimize the event selection and to estimate the signal efficiency. The signal MC sample is generated with the EvtGen package [14], assuming a three-body phase space combined with a resonance decaying to two kaons as observed by BABAR and LHCb [3,5]. To reconstruct B\u00fe \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212\u03c0\u00fe, we combine two oppositely charged kaons with a charged pion. Charged tracks originating from a B decay are required to have a distance of closest approach with respect to the interaction point of less than 5.0 cm along the z axis (opposite the positron beam direction) and less than 0.2 cm in the r \u2212 \u03d5 transverse plane and a transverse momentum of at least 100 MeV=c. Charged kaons and pions are identified using the charged-hadron particle identification (PID) systems, namely CDC, ACC, and TOF. The information from the PID systems is combined to form a K-\u03c0 likelihood ratio RK=\u03c0 \u00bc LK=\u00f0LK \u00fe L\u03c0\u00de, where LK and L\u03c0 are the likelihoods for the kaon and pion hypotheses, respectively. Tracks with RK=\u03c0 > 0.6 are regarded as kaons and those with RK=\u03c0 < 0.4 as pions. With these requirements, the identification efficiencies for 1 GeV=c kaons and pions are 83%and90%, respectively; 6%of thepions aremisidentified as kaons, and 12% of the kaons are misidentified as pions. Candidate B mesons are identified using two kinematic variables in the c.m. frame: the beam-energy constrained mass, Mbc \u2261 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi E2beam=c 4 \u2212 jpB=cj2 p\n, and the energy difference, \u0394E\u2261 EB \u2212 Ebeam, where EB and pB are the reconstructed energy and momentum of B candidates in the c.m. frame, respectively, and Ebeam is the run-dependent beam energy corresponding to half of the c.m. energy. TheB-meson candidates are required to have Mbc > 5.24 GeV=c2 and j\u0394Ej < 0.3 GeV, and a signal-enhanced region is defined as 5.27<Mbc<5.29GeV=c2 and j\u0394Ej<0.05GeV for the optimization of background suppression. For 19% of the events, there is more than oneB-meson candidate in an event; we choose the onewith the best fit quality from theBvertex fit using the three charged tracks. This criterion selects the correctly reconstructed B-meson candidate in 92% of MC events.\nC.-L. HSU et al. PHYS. REV. D 107, 032013 (2023)\n032013-2"

The difference on the event topology between the spherical BB\u0304 signal and the jetlike continuum background can be exploited; a Fisher discriminant formed from 17 modified Fox-Wolfram moments [15] is introduced to suppress backgrounds from this source. To further improve the classification power, we combine the output of the Fisher discriminant with four other discriminating observables in a neural network employed by the NeuroBayes software package [16]. The observables are the cosine of the angle between the B candidate direction and the beam axis, the cosine of the angle between the thrust axis [17] of the B candidate and that of the rest of event (both of these quantities being calculated in the c.m. frame), the separation along the z axis between the vertex of the B candidate and that of the remaining tracks, and the tagging quality variable from a B flavor-tagging algorithm [18]. The training and optimization of the neural network are performed with signal and continuum MC samples. The neural network output (CNN) selection requirement is optimized by maximizing a figure of merit defined as NS= ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi NS \u00fe NB p in the signal-enhanced region defined in the previous paragraph, where NS denotes the expected number of signal events based on MC simulation for a branching fraction of 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 and NB denotes the expected number of background events. The CNN is required to be greater than 0.88, which removes 99% of the continuum events while retaining 48% of the signal. Background contributions from B decays via the dominant b \u2192 c transition (generic B decays) are investigated with a MC sample of such decays. The resulting \u0394E distribution is found to peak strongly in the signal region. Peaks are observed in the K\u00feK\u2212 and K\u2212\u03c0\u00fe invariant-mass spectra, arising from b \u2192 c decays. These peaking contributions are from D0 \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212 or K\u2212\u03c0\u00fe at the nominal D0 mass or from \u03c7c0 \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212 at the nominal \u03c7c0 mass. In the K\u00feK\u2212 mass distribution, D0 \u2192 K\u2212\u03c0\u00fe form the peak slightly shifted from the D0 mass in the MK\u00feK\u2212 spectrum owing to K \u2212 \u03c0 misidentification. To suppress these backgrounds, the candidates for which the invariant mass of the K\u00feK\u2212 or K\u2212\u03c0\u00fe system lies in range of 1850\u20131880 MeV=c2 are removed. The veto region corresponds to 3.75\u03c3 around the nominal D0 mass, where \u03c3 is the mass resolution. In the case of K \u2212 \u03c0 misidentification, we use the pion-mass hypothesis for one of the kaons. For a K\u00feK\u2212 candidate pair, both K\u00fe\u03c0\u2212 and \u03c0\u00feK\u2212 assignments are tested, and when at least one of them lies within the veto region, the candidate is rejected. A veto mass range of 3375\u20133475 MeV=c2 is introduced to reject the backgrounds from \u03c70c \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212 decays. To suppress the possible charmonium backgrounds from J=\u03c8 \u2192 l\u00fel\u2212\u00f0l \u00bc e; \u03bc\u00de decays, we apply the electron- or muon-mass hypothesis for both charged daughters and exclude candidates that lie\nin the range of 3060\u20133140 MeV=c2, which corresponds to 4\u03c3 around the nominal J=\u03c8 mass. Since no significant peak is found in the \u03c8\u00f02S\u00de mass region, we do not apply a veto for it. The charmless B decays are studied with a large MC sample where one of the B mesons decays to a charmless final state. There are a few modes that contribute in theMbc signal region with a corresponding \u0394E peak, denoted collectively as the \u201crare peaking\u201d background. These backgrounds are caused by the K \u2212 \u03c0 misidentification that leads to the \u0394E peaks shifted toward the negative (positive) values for B\u00fe \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212K\u00fe (B\u00fe \u2192 K\u00fe\u03c0\u2212\u03c0\u00fe) and its intermediate resonant modes. The remaining contribution other than the peaking components is called the \u201crare combinatorial\u201d background."

The parameters of the continuum PDF are derived fromMC simulation, which agrees with the off-resonance data. The others (generic B, rare combinatorial, rare peaking, and SCF) are modeled with two-dimensional smoothed histograms from MC simulation due to the strong correlation between \u0394E and Mbc. The free parameters in the fit are the signal yield, the signal ACP, the generic B yield, the rare peaking yields, and the continuum yield. The yields of rare combinatorial\nbackgrounds are also derived from the MC study. The ACP of all backgrounds is fixed to zero in the fit. The stability and bias of the two-dimensional fit is checked by ensemble tests with a set of large-statistics MC events. The validity of the fit and branching fraction extraction method is checked using data in a high-statistics control sample of the B\u00fe \u2192 D\u03040\u00f0K\u00feK\u2212\u00de\u03c0\u00fe decays. The measured branching fraction for the control sample is consistent with the world-average value [20]. As an example, Fig. 2 shows the fit results within the range of 0.98 < MK\u00feK\u2212 < 1.1 GeV=c2 in a signalenhanced region.

We assume that charged and neutral BB\u0304 pairs are produced equally at the \u03d2\u00f04S\u00de resonance. Table I lists the fitted yields, the efficiencies, and the measured ACP in all MK\u00feK\u2212 bins. Figures of the fit results in all MK\u00feK\u2212 bins are attached in Appendix A.

To determine the spin configuration of the K\u00feK\u2212 system for the signal in MK\u00feK\u2212 < 1.1 GeV=c2, the signal yields are obtained by fitting to the data samples in bins of the helicity angle, and are summarized in Table II. The helicity angle, \u03b8hel, is defined as the angle between the momenta of the B meson and the kaon with the same charge as the B meson, as both are evaluated in the K\u00feK\u2212 rest frame. Due to the large ACP observed in the data sample, only the B\u00fe candidates are used in the fit. Since there is no evidence for the narrow \u03d5 state in the MK\u00feK\u2212 distribution and there is no other resonance between 0.98 GeV=c2 < MK\u00feK\u2212 < 1.1 GeV=c2, a priori one would expect no specific spin configuration in the data.

Systematic uncertainties in the partial branching fraction in MK\u00feK\u2212 bins are itemized in Table V, while those for the measurements in MK\u00fe\u03c0\u2212 are listed in Table VI.\nANGULAR ANALYSIS OF THE LOW K\u00feK\u2212 \u2026 PHYS. REV. D 107, 032013 (2023)\nThe uncertainty due to the total number of BB\u0304 pairs is 1.4%.

The uncertainty due to the RK=\u03c0 requirements is determined by a control sample study ofD \u00fe \u2192 D0\u03c0\u00fes with D0 \u2192 K\u2212\u03c0\u00fe, where \u03c0\u00fes denotes a low-momentum charged pion. This low-momentum pion allows the event to be reconstructed with good signal/noise ratio without relying on particle identification information. Since the particle identification efficiency is related to the momenta of the tracks, the efficiency and fake rate were studied in different momentum and polar angle bins. In the end, we obtained an efficiency correction of 94.2% and a corresponding uncertainty of 1.4%. The uncertainties due to the continuum suppression and the signal PDF shape are estimated using a control sample of B\u00fe \u2192 D\u03040\u00f0K\u00feK\u2212\u00de\u03c0\u00fe decays. The potential fit bias is evaluated by performing an ensemble test comprising 1000 pseudoexperiments, where the signal component is taken from the signal MC sample, and the backgrounds are generated using the shapes of their PDFs obtained from the MC samples. The observed 2.3% bias is included in the systematic uncertainty calculation. The uncertainty due to the continuum background PDF modeling is evaluated by varying the PDF parameters by 1\u03c3 of their statistical errors. The uncertainty due to the data/MC difference is taken into account by using the fit model from the offresonance data, which is included in the background PDF modeling in Table V. For the BB\u0304 background PDFs that are modeled by two-dimensional smoothed histogram PDFs, the associated uncertainty is evaluated by changing the bin sizes. The uncertainty due to the fixed yields of rare combinatorial backgrounds is also evaluated by varying each fixed yield up or down by its statistical error. The uncertainty due to nonzero ACP of rare peaking backgrounds is estimated by assuming the LHCb measurements and their uncertainties [5]. In the absence of knowledge of the distribution of the SCF component in MK\u00feK\u2212 and MK\u00fe\u03c0\u2212 bins, we use a conservative approach to evaluate the uncertainty by varying the fraction by 50%; the resulting\ndeviation from the nominal value is included in the fixed yields in Tables V and VI. The ACP systematic errors due to the fixed yields, background ACP, and the background PDF modeling are estimated with the same procedure as applied for the branching fraction. A possible detector bias due to tracking acceptance and RK=\u03c0 is evaluated using the measured asymmetry from the off-resonance data, AoffCP.

The original asymmetry of the testing sample is 0.0017 0.0019\u00f0stat\u00de and that of the reweighted sample is 0.0021 0.0019\u00f0stat\u00de. The conclusion is that the asymmetries from the original and reweighted samples are consistent and hence any asymmetric efficiency due to kaons has a negligible contribution to the systematic uncertainty. Therefore, for this analysis, we only need to consider the detector asymmetry from charged pions. We apply the same criteria as those for the signal except for the continuum-suppression requirement in order to increase the statistics in the off-resonance data. The value of AoffCP is 0.0024 0.0014. Because it is consistent with zero within two standard deviations, we do not correct the detector bias for the measured ACP. The central shift plus 1\u03c3 statistical error is quoted as the systematic uncertainty for the detector bias. The systematic uncertainties in ACP are included in Table V."

            "text": "In conclusion, we report the measured branching fraction and direct CP asymmetry for the suppressed decay B\u00fe \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212\u03c0\u00fe using the full \u03d2\u00f04S\u00de data sample collected with the Belle detector. We employ a two-dimensional fit to determine the branching fraction as a function of MK\u00feK\u2212 and MK\u00fe\u03c0\u2212 and ACP as a function of MK\u00feK\u2212 . We confirm the excess and nonzero local ACP in the lowMK\u00feK\u2212 region reported by LHCb and quantify the differential branching fraction in each K\u00feK\u2212 and K\u2212\u03c0\u00fe invariant mass bin. We find an evidence of 4.8\u03c3 significance for a negative CP asymmetry in the region MK\u00feK\u2212 < 1.1 GeV=c2. Our measured values of the overall branching fraction and direct CP asymmetry are B\u00f0B\u00fe \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212\u03c0\u00fe\u00de \u00bc \u00f05.38 0.40 0.35\u00de \u00d7 10\u22126 and ACP \u00bc \u22120.170 0.073 0.017, respectively. The measurement challenges the conventional description of direct CP violation [22] since it requires large contributions to separate weak tree and strong penguin amplitudes in the same small region of phase space in order to simultaneously enhance both the yield and provide the cancellation required for such a large CP effect. So, for example, if the enhancement were due to a large final-state resonance in a strong penguin diagram, there would have to be an accompanying tree-level process of the same magnitude and opposite phase to provide the almost complete cancellation observed in the measurement. The Dalitz analysis performed by LHCb finds a significant contribution from S-wave \u03c0\u00fe\u03c0\u2212 \u2192 K\u00feK\u2212 rescattering, particularly at low invariant mass. Our angular analysis shows a more complex spin structure than the pure P-wave in the lowest MK\u00feK\u2212 bin and the LHCb model is not inconsistent with our data. Overall, the local enhancement\nin yield and direct CP asymmetry at low MK\u00feK\u2212 are well reproduced by the LHCb amplitude model. Understanding this with an ab initio calculation remains an interesting challenge."
