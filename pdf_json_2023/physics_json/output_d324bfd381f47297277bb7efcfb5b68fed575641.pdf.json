    "abstractText": "A potent nontoxic antitumor drug, 2-hydroxyoleic acid (6, 2OHOA) used for membrane lipid therapy, was selected as a self-assembly inducer due to its ability to form nanoparticles (NPs) in water. For this purpose, it was conjugated with a series of anticancer drugs through a disulfidecontaining linker to enhance cell penetration and to secure drug release inside the cell. The antiproliferative evaluation of the synthesized NP formulations against three human tumor cell lines (biphasic mesothelioma MSTO-211H, colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29, and glioblastoma LN-229) showed that nanoassemblies 16\u201322a,bNPs exhibit antiproliferative activity at micromolar and submicromolar concentrations. Furthermore, the ability of the disulfide-containing linker to promote cellular effects was confirmed for most nanoformulations. Finally, 17bNP induced intracellular ROS increase in glioblastoma LN-229 cells similarly to free drug 8, and such elevated production was decreased by pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. Also, nanoformulations 18bNP and 21bNP confirmed the mechanism of action of the free drugs.",

For several years, we have been interested in the synthesis of natural products-based nanoparticles (NPs) for selective targeting and controlled release of anticancer drugs to tumors, limiting their toxicity against normal cells. More specifically, they were designed and synthesized conjugates able to form NPs that release drugs in cellular media, hetero-NPs bearing two different drugs, fluorescent NPs obtained by mixing drug- and fluorophore-based conjugates, as well as folic acid based hetero-NPs to exploit active drug targeting [4\u20138]. Naturally occurring anticancer drugs with a well-documented biological activity against specific cancers were selected; the drug was conjugated through a linker to a lipophilic self-assembly inducer, with the aim to obtain NPs in water [9,10]. The proper choice of a linker and a self-assembly inducer is crucial in the engineering of the final NPs in terms of particle size, structural, chemical, mechanical, and biological properties. Moreover, an intrinsic biological activity against the same target and potential synergy with the carried\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 722. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16050722 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 722 2 of 17\ndrug could be a further benefit. In our previous works, the self-assembly inducing moiety was either squalene (1), 4-(1, 2-diphenylbut-1-en-1-yl)aniline (2), 20-hydroxyecdisone (3), or betulinic acid (4) [4,5,11,12]. In continuing our exploration of new self-assembly inducers, our attention was directed to the nontoxic lipophilic anticancer drug 2OHOA (6) [13], the \u03b1-hydroxy derivative of oleic acid (5) (Figure 1).\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 18\nintrinsic biological activity against the same target and potential synergy with the carried drug could be a further benefit.

Furthermore, it represents a conceptually new approach for treating cancer, called membrane lipid therapy (MLT) [16,17]; by its interaction with membrane lipids, it causes profound membrane lipid remodeling in cancer cells but not in normal cells, altering the organization of membrane micro-domains and finally impairing proliferation by arresting cell cycle progress from the G1 to S phase [13,18]. It also modulates the activity of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS1), increasing the concentration of sphingomyelin in cancer cells with high specificity and potency [19]. Moreover, cellular and molecular evidence have shown that 2OHOA induces autophagy in glioma cancer cells, constituting a novel therapeutic strategy to combat glioma in apoptosis-resistant tumor cells [20]. Another study revealed that (S) 2OHOA was responsible for an increased concentration of sphingomyelin; nevertheless, racemic 2OHOA [21] exhibited an almost identical IC50 in the inhibition of the growth of the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, consistent with the combined effect on membrane organization by enantiopure or racemic 2OHOA, and on sphingomyelin concentration by the S isomer. Furthermore, 2OHOA can depolarize mitochondrial inner membranes by acting as a cancer-selective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) uncoupler, compromising glycolytic stress response, and enhancing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [22]. Examples in the literature of the application of 2OHOA in the NP field are rather limited. It can be effectively incorporated in cationic liposomes that resulted to be quite specific in targeting the tumor vasculature [23,24]. Moreover, it can form pH-dependent nano-self-assemblies with glycerol mono-oleate, with the potential to selectively target the acidic extracellular pH environment of cancer tissues [25]. In connection to our previous studies and considering the current state-of-the-art literature, we conjugated 2OHOA through a disulfide-based linker which secures the drug release (Figure 2) with well-known anticancer drugs (7\u201313, Figure 3), and evaluated (a) their ability to self-assemble in water and (b) the antiproliferative activity of the obtained NPs against human tumor cell lines. The presence of a disulfide bond is crucial for triggered drug release at the tumor site as the disulfide bond is stable at physiological body temperature, pH, and oxidation environment, whereas it can be degraded by reducing agents such as glutathione (GSH).

Based on these results and on the remarkable antiproliferative effect of 17bNP on all cell lines, we investigated its mechanism of action with the aim to assess if the intracellular events induced by free cabazitaxel (8) are maintained by the nanoformulation 17bNP.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 722 8 of 17\nThe seven drugs 7\u201313 confirmed their cytotoxicity towards tumor cells, as GI50 in the low micromolar or nanomolar range were obtained in all cell lines taken into consideration, also in accordance with our earlier data [31]. In detail, podophyllotoxin (12) and thiocolchicine (13) exerted the lowest antiproliferative effect with GI50 values ranging from 0.011 to 0.030 \u00b5M, whereas cabazitaxel (8) and docetaxel (9) appear as the most effective drugs, showing GI50 values from 0.7 to 2.0 nM. We also evaluated 2OHOA, and it showed GI50 >100 \u00b5M in all cell lines, in accordance with reported evidence [20]. Incubation of cells in the presence of 16\u201322a,bNPs resulted, in all cases, in significant cytotoxicity, with GI50 values in the micromolar and submicromolar range. Interestingly, such cellular effect is more pronounced for nanoconjugates containing 4,4\u2032-dithiodibutyric acid (16b\u201322b) with respect to those built with sebacic acid as linker (16a\u201322a). In fact, the noticeable contribution of the disulfide linker appears particularly significant for the 17a,bNP and 18a,bNP pairs, in which it induces a 6- to 25-fold increase in activity, as confirmed also by the cytotoxicity curves shown in Figure 6A and B, respectively. Otherwise, NPs containing the free drug linkers 15a,bNP, are unable to induce cytotoxicity (Table 2). For the most cytotoxic drugs 8 and 9, and for the corresponding NPs built on the disulfide linker 17bNP and 18bNP, the antiproliferative effect was also tested on human nontumorigenic Met-5A (mesothelium) cells.

Taking into consideration that cabazitaxel promotes ROS production in human cancer cells, and this increase was correlated with its cytotoxic effect [32], LN229 cells were loaded with 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, treated with free 8 and 17bNP for 30 min and then intracellular ROS production was determined by a fluorimetric assay. We found that both free drug and nanoformulation induced intracellular ROS accumulation in LN-229 glioblastoma cells, and such elevated ROS production was inhibited by pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC).
