Sectoral Impacts of US Monetary Policy Tightening: Conducting a sectoral analysis to understand which sectors in emerging markets are most vulnerable to US monetary policy tightening. This could include studying the differential impacts on sectors such as manufacturing, services, agriculture, and technology.
