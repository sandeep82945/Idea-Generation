Extension to Multi-component Distillation Columns: The current study focuses on a binary methanol-water separation column. Future research could extend this methodology to more complex multi-component distillation columns, which are common in industries such as petrochemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Investigating the applicability and optimization of ADRC and soft sensor techniques in these scenarios could help in handling more complex separation processes with higher efficiency.

Real-time Adaptive Control Strategies: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of static and dynamic PCR models in estimating product compositions. A natural extension could explore the development of real-time adaptive control strategies that adjust the model parameters dynamically based on real-time data. This could further enhance the robustness of the control system against significant process disturbances and model inaccuracies.

Integration with Energy Optimization Algorithms: Considering the significant energy consumption associated with distillation processes, integrating inferential ADRC control schemes with energy optimization algorithms could provide a pathway to minimizing energy usage while maintaining product quality. Research could focus on developing algorithms that dynamically adjust control parameters to achieve optimal energy efficiency based on current operating conditions and market energy prices.

Advanced Soft Sensor Development: The paper utilizes static and dynamic PCR for soft sensor development. Future research could explore the integration of more advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for soft sensor development, such as deep learning or reinforcement learning models. These advanced models could potentially offer improved accuracy in composition estimation and better adaptability to complex process dynamics.

Robustness and Reliability Analysis under Varied Operating Conditions: The inferential ADRC control scheme's robustness and reliability under varied and extreme operating conditions merit further investigation. Future studies could simulate or experimentally validate the control scheme's performance under a wide range of disturbances, such as sudden feed composition changes, significant throughput variations, or equipment failures. This research could help in identifying limitations and proposing enhancements to the control strategy.
