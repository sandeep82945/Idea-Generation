    "abstractText": "The cyclization of di-(2,6-difluorophenyl)maleindinitrile with magnesium(II) and zinc(II) acetates in boiling ethylene glycol is applied to synthesize Mg(II) and Zn(II) complexes of the octa(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin. The compounds are identified by UV\u2013Vis, 1H NMR, and mass spectrometry methods. A comparative analysis is performed of the spectral-luminescent properties of magnesium and zinc octaaryltetraazaporphyrinates and their dependence on the number and position of the fluorine atoms in the macrocycle phenyl fragments. The DFT method is used to optimize the geometry of the synthesized complexes. Machine learning methods and QSPR are applied to predict the Soret band wavelength in the UV\u2013V is spectra of the complexes described.",

Porphyrins and their azaanalogues have been recently widely used as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy and photodynamic diagnostics and as sensors sensitized by solar cell dyes in chemical catalysis and analytical chemistry [1\u20139]. The chemical modification of the peripheral substituents of the macrocycle leads to significant changes in its spectral and electrochemical properties [10,11], making it possible to produce novel polyfunctional materials with desired photophysical properties that can broaden the application range of porphyrazines. Porphyrins are known to demonstrate their practical efficiency when part of metal complexes. The selective action of metalloporphyrins is the result of the metal atom nature and molecule structure. The specific chemical behavior of substituted metalloporphyrins is mainly caused by the presence of a complex branched macrocycle and strong conjugation of the \u03c0\u2013electron system [12]. The method of template cyclotetramerization of porphyrin molecule fragments with a metal or its salt has been used to synthesize ionic and covalent complexes based on porphyrins [13\u201315] and tetraazaporphyrins [16\u201320]. In this work, cyclization of di-(2,6-difluorophenyl)maleindinitrile with acetates of the respective metals in boiling ethylene glycol was applied to synthesize and identify Mg(II)- and Zn(II)-octa-(2,6difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin complexes. The choice of the complexes was prompted by the fact that they are quite easily formed through cyclization of the respective salts with nitriles [16,18\u201320] and 3-carboxymethylphthalimidines [13,14] (i.e., they are accessible compounds). Additionally, they are also quite interesting because, being rather labile, these complexes are used in metal exchange reactions to prepare more inaccessible complexes of aza-porphyrins with heavy metals and variable valence metals.

Geometrical Optimization and Energy Characteristics We carried out geometrical optimization of the Mg(II) and Zn(II) complexes with\nocta-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazapo phyrin and performed a natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis [22] by the d nsity functional theory (DFT) method [23,24] applying the hybrid Becke three-parameter Lee\u2013Yang\u2013Parr exchange\u2013correlatio functional (B3LYP) [25] and the 6-31G++ basis set [26]. The calculations were made in the Gaussian V16 software package.\nFigure 4 shows the main designations of the atoms in the structure of the compounds under study.\nThe geometrical optimization of the studied compounds showed that the most energetically favorable structure was that with C1 symmetry. The structure with D2d symmetry had imaginary frequencies of the vibrations, the shape of which facilitated the transition to the structure with the C1 symmetry. There were four vibrations of that kind. Hence, the D2d symmetry was the fourth-order saddle point on the C1 path. For D2d symmetry, four imaginary frequencies were found: \u221227.7561 (A2), \u221231.8519 (E), \u221231.8519 (E), and \u221234.8350 (B1) for MgF16PA; and \u221228.5049 (A2), \u221232.7111 (E), \u221232.7111 (E), and \u221235.7748 (B1) for ZnF16PA. The vibrations correspond to a change in the phenyl rings position relative to the macrocycle. The dihedral angle C-C\u03b2-C1ph-C2ph varies from ~87 to ~90. At the point of minimum total energy, the matrix of second derivatives has only positive eigenvalues, and, at the saddle point, it has one negative eigenvalue. Because, in our case, there were four negative values, we could consider this a fourth-order saddle point. The total energy minima correspond to stable structures and intermediates, while the saddle points correspond to transition states. A comparison of the geometric parameters of complexes 1 and 2 showed that the replacement of the metal in the center slightly changed the macrocycle structure but did not affect the geometric parameters of the phenyl rings. The N-Zn bond was shorter and, hence, stronger than N-Mg, which means the zinc coordination interaction with the nitrogen atoms was also stronger. The phenyl rings were shown to be geometrically different. The dihedral angles in Table 3 demonstrate this. They can be divided into two types for convenience (Figure 5). The NBO analysis did not give a clear explanation of this structure. The interactions of the orbitals indifferent types of the rings were not the same, but the differences were within the measurement error.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8619 6 of 12\nTo some extent, the angle N-M-N, where N atoms are not near and are opposite, can serve as a planarity measure. For the Mg complex, this value is 180; this is probably connected with the size of the metal\u2013ion and the ionic type of bond. For the Zn complex, the angle is 172.675, which indicates some nonplanarity degree. The M-N-C-N\u03b1 angle can also be considered as a planarity measure; for an idle planarity structure, this value would be 0.

Figure 6 pr sents the type and energy of the frontier molecular orbitals of the studied compounds. The molecular orbitals involved in the excitation or absorption (e.g., Q band) are shown in Figure 6. The orbital calculation models show that the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* character of the transition between HOMO, HOMO-1, LUMO, and LUMO+1 is characteristic of both complexes. This conclusion follows from the localization of the electrons on the \u03c0-orbitals of the central part of the macrocycle. The occupied molecular orbitals of Zn-porphyrazine were lower than those of Mgporphyrazine, whereas the virtual ones were higher. This explains why the difference between the ZnPz HOMO and LUMO was slightly bigger in absolute value, which means that the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* transition was more energy-consuming than that of ZnPz. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the metal replacement (magnesium replacement with zinc) in the macrocycle core had the biggest effect on HOMO-1 as it caused the most significant changes in its energy. Among the frontier orbitals, it was HOMO that was affected most. We calculated electronic spectra for obtained compounds by the TD-DFT method, using nstate = 10 and root = 1 parameters (Figures S8 and S9). We also tried to calculate one spectrum with nstates = 6 and root = 20 parameters (Figure S10). Unfortunately, essential results were not obtained for these parameters. The absorption bands of the Zn complex have a significant red shift in comparison with those of the Mg complex; in the experiment, the Soret band of the Zn complex had little blue shift in comparison with that of the Mg complex. Moreover, the TD-DFT calculation of compound 2 did not predict the active Soret band; it is difficult to say why that is the case, because the structures are rather similar. Perhaps the issue related to a program error or to the calculated electron structure of compound 2 (for example, we can see some differences in virtual orbitals in comparison with complex 1)."

Other authors [32] also attempted to predict this value, but their results were as unpromising as ours despite a bigger sampling (Table 4). Such results can easily be explained: the datasets used did not contain any data on either meso-aza-substituted porphyrins or their analogues with a heteroatom in the macrocycle meso-positions. This made the models incapable of accurately predicting the properties of the structures under consideration. However, finding this feature in the obtained mathematical models can facilitate their further development through adding data to the datasets or developing personalized models for tetraazaporphyrins and their derivatives.\n* The wavelength value was taken from [33] as the authors did not specify the spectral properties directly in [20].\nPreviously, we calculated the electron spectra of obtained compounds using the TDDFT method, and we compared the results of a machine learning (ML) prediction with the TD-DFT prediction (Table 5).\nAs can be seen from the comparison of calculated electron spectra characteristics (TD-DFT method) with the results of the machine learning (ML) prediction, the errors are comparable (Table 5). In both cases, there are ways to improve the prognosis. The mathematical model, as indicated, does not quite match the tetraazaporphyrins, because they are not in the training set. A prediction using quantum chemistry was performed by TD-DFT without taking into account the dissolving model, and the solvent has a significant effect on the spectrum band\u2019s position. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. However, machine learning methods have recently been extremely dynamically developing, and they are also somewhat easier for a user, because they often do not even need a commercial program.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8619 10 of 12"

            "text": "In this work, the cyclization of di-(2,6-difluorophenyl)maleindinitrile with magnesium(II) and zinc(II) acetates in boiling ethylene glycol was applied to synthesize Mg(II) and Zn(II) complexes of octa-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin. A comparative analysis was performed of the spectral-luminescent properties of magnesium and zinc octaaryltetraazaporphyrins and their dependence on the number and position of the fluorine atoms in the macrocycle phenyl fragments. The DFT method was used to carry out geometrical optimization of the structure of the synthesized complexes. Machine learning methods and QSPR were employed to predict the Soret band wavelength in the UV\u2013Vis spectra of the complexes described. Although the prediction results did not appear promising at this stage, the present work will certainly facilitate further development of the existing mathematical models by adding data to the datasets or developing models for aza-substituted tetrapyrrole macrocyclic compounds (porphyrins, tetrabenzoporphyrins, and phthalocyanines). Taking into account the fact that fluorine-substituted complexes of porphyrazines have increased n-conductivity, the obtained results can be used to create functional materials exhibiting unusual nonlinear optical, catalytic, and electrochemical properties.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 8619 11 of 12\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules27238619/s1, Figure S1: The isotopic distribution of the molecular ion peak of Mg(II)-octa-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin; Figure S2: The isotopic distribution of the molecular ion peak of Zn(II)-octa-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin; Figure S3: 1H NMR spectrum of Mg(II)-octa-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin in d6 DMSO; Figure S4: 1H NMR spectrum of Zn(II)-octa-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin in d6 DMSO; Figure S5: IR spectrum of Mg(II)-octa-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin in tablets KBr; Figure S6: IR spectrum of Zn(II)-octa-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin in tablets KBr; Figure S7: 1H NMR spectrum of di-(2,6-difluorophenyl)maleindinitrile in CDCl3; Figure S8: Mass-spectrum of di-(2,6-difluorophenyl)maleindinitrile; Figure S9: Predicted UV-Vis spectrum of Mg(II)-octa-(2,6difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin with nstate = 10 \u0438 root = 1 parameters; Figure S10: Predicted UV-Vis spectrum of Zn(II)-octa-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin with nstate = 10 \u0438 root = 1 parameters; Figure S11: Predicted UV-Vis spectrum of Zn(II)-octa-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin with nstate = 6 \u0438 root = 20 parameters; Figure S12: Visualization of the planarity measure of Mg(II)octa-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin and Zn(II)-octa-(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin; Table S1: The values from visualization of the planarity measure and equations of them.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, N.M. and N.C.; methodology, N.C. and A.R.; software, N.M. and A.R.
