1. **Investigating the impact of model size on rationality performance.** The paper finds that model size is strongly correlated with rationality performance, but it is unclear whether this relationship is causal. Future research could investigate this relationship more deeply, by conducting experiments with models of different sizes and controlling for other factors that could affect rationality performance.
2. **Developing new methods for assessing rationality performance.** The paper's benchmark is a valuable tool for assessing rationality performance, but it is not the only possible method. Future research could develop new methods for assessing rationality performance, which could be more sensitive to different aspects of rationality.
3. **Exploring the relationship between rationality and other cognitive abilities.** The paper finds that rationality performance is correlated with performance on other cognitive abilities, such as logic and probability. Future research could investigate this relationship more deeply, by conducting experiments that measure both rationality performance and other cognitive abilities.
4. **Investigating the impact of adaptation strategies on rationality performance.** The paper finds that adaptation strategies, such as self-explanation and prompting, can improve rationality performance. Future research could investigate the impact of these adaptation strategies more deeply, by conducting experiments that compare different adaptation strategies and measure their impact on rationality performance.
5. **Developing new models of rationality.** The paper's benchmark is based on a specific model of rationality, which is based on the von Neumannâ€“Morgenstern expected utility model. Future research could develop new models of rationality, which could be more appropriate for different tasks or domains.
