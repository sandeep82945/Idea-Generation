    "abstractText": "Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) is the most promising cathode material for use in safe electric vehicles (EVs), due to its long cycle stability, low cost, and low toxicity, but it suffers from low conductivity and ion diffusion. In this work, we present a simple method to obtain LFP/carbon (LFP/C) composites with different types of NC: cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and cellulose nanofiber (CNF). Microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis was used to obtain LFP with nanocellulose inside the vessel, and the final LFP/C composite was achieved by heating the mixture under a N2 atmosphere. The resulting LFP/C indicated that the NC in the reaction medium not only acts as the reducing agent that aqueous iron solutions need (avoiding the use of other chemicals), but also as a stabiliser of the nanoparticles produced in the hydrothermal synthesis, obtaining fewer agglomerated particles compared to synthesis without NC. The sample with the best coating\u2014and, therefore, the best electrochemical response\u2014was the sample with 12.6% carbon derived from CNF in the composite instead of CNC, due to its homogeneous coating. The utilisation of CNF in the reaction medium could be a promising method to obtain LFP/C in a simple, rapid, and low-cost way, avoiding the waste of unnecessary chemicals.",

            "text": "The development of new generations of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) is in constant growth for their use as the energy sources for electric vehicles (EVs) [1,2], as well as for energy storage for sustainable energies, contributing to their intermittence [3\u20135]. Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) cathodes are widely used for these purposes because they have the advantages of low cost, environmental friendliness, thermal stability, and low toxicity, unlike the most widely used cathode material LiCoO2 [6]; however, they have the disadvantages of low electric conductivity and poor lithium-ion diffusivity, limiting their use by decreasing their practical capacity [7,8]. Many researchers have studied the diminution of the particle size to improve the diffusion of lithium ions, due to the particle reduction shortening the distances to cover [8\u201310]. Consequently, the synthesis conditions are vital for obtaining a small particle size; hence, there exist many methods to obtain these compounds: solid-state, hydrothermal, solvothermal, etc. [11]. Hydrothermal synthesis is the simplest method to obtain nanoparticles, because it uses simple compounds such as\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2628. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15122628 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2628 2 of 16\nwater [12,13]; thus, the use of toxic and harmful chemicals is avoided. Unfortunately, this method faces the difficulty of iron-ion oxidation in aqueous media; hence, it is necessary to include an auxiliary compound that prevents the oxidation. Previous works have shown that hydrothermal synthesis combined with microwave methodology can be used to obtain a homogeneous particle distribution, shorter reaction time, and small particle size, which could be beneficial for cathodes in LIBs [10,14]. On the other hand, to improve the low electric conductivity of LFP, the most widely used method is coating the nanoparticles with carbon compounds. Many different compounds have been studied successfully, including graphene, carbon nanotubes, and more sustainable sources such as glucose and sucrose. Researchers have shown that organic sources of carbon compounds can cover the particles homogeneously [15\u201317], unlike inorganic sources such as carbon nanotubes, whose cylindrical shape makes it difficult for them to cover the nanoparticles completely [18\u201320]. Kanagaraj et al. investigated the incorporation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using an ex situ pathway, obtaining large particles with a lack of electron conduction, leading to a poor specific capacity close to 22 mAhg\u22121 at 0.2 C\u2013rate, using an inorganic compound [21]. Conversely, Meng et al. used in situ coating with an organic source to obtain an LFP material with 1\u20132 nm of carbon coating and a specific capacity close to 162 mAhg\u22121 at 0.1 C\u2013rate [22]. Therefore, the use of organic sources for the carbon compounds in LFP/C composites seems to be a promising approach that needs to be improved, because one of the main problems is the low quality of the final carbon obtained\u2014since it requires an additional heat treatment [23], in contrast to inorganic compounds\u2014and also, typically, larger particles (attributed to precursors with large dimensions, such as glucose or sucrose [24]) are obtained. For these reasons, it is necessary to search for new materials to obtain LFP/C composites with a smaller particle size. Nanocellulose (NC), a nanoscale material of cellulose fibre, is the most abundant natural polymer in the world. It can be classified into different types, of which cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and cellulose nanofiber or nanofibrillated cellulose (CNF) are the most important [25,26]. They differ in the methodology used to obtain them: chemical treatment for the CNC, and delamination of the wood using mechanical procedures in the case of CNF [27\u201329]. Using this kind of material as the carbon source can avoid the use of inorganic, expensive, and toxic compounds such as graphene or carbon nanotubes, and they can cover LFP nanoparticles homogeneously due to their organic nature. NC can also act as the reducing agent [30,31] that iron ions need in hydrothermal synthesis; thus, this nanomaterial is an encouraging compound due to its small particle size in contrast to other organic sources that have been used. Few investigations have used some type of NC to form LFP/C composites. Park et al. [32] reported a mixture of CNF with graphene oxide and LFP that, after heat treatment, formed a composite in which the carbon was produced from the carbonisation of CNF and reduced graphene. This cathode exhibited good performance, with a discharge capacity of 168.9 mAhg\u22121 at 0.1 C\u2013rate, and the researchers attributed these good results to the CNF because it can prevent the GO stacking, act as an extra carbon source, and avoid agglomeration of LFP during annealing. This methodology mixes carbon compounds after the synthesis of LFP\u2014an ex situ pathway. In contrast, in this work, we present a simple methodology using only the reagents for LiFePO4, NC, and water as the solvent to obtain the final LFP/C composite\u2014a much more efficient and environmentally friendly methodology that avoids the use of harmful reagents and multiple steps. Moreover, we report an easy method to obtain the LFP/C composite, using NC in the hydrothermal reaction medium as a carbon source, a reducing agent for the iron ions, and a stabiliser to avoid grain size growth, creating a simple and new methodology to create sustainable LFP/C materials. For this purpose, we mixed the precursors of LFP with CNC and CNF separately for further comparisons, in deionised water, and incorporated them into a microwave reactor vessel to heat at different temperatures and for different reaction times. Then, the dry mixture of LFP/NC was carbonised in a tube furnace at 600 \u25e6C for 1 h in a N2 atmosphere to obtain the LFP/C composite.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2628 3 of 16"

CNC (8 wt. %) was obtained from Blue Goose Biorefineries Inc., Canada, and CNF (15% solids) was purchased from the Process Development Center, the University of Maine, USA. As solvents, technical ethanol (EtOH 96%) and Milli-Q water (18.2 M\u2126cm\u22121) were used for all experiments. Lithium hexafluorophosphate in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate solution (1.0 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC 50/50 v/v, battery grade) was used as an electrolyte; poly(vinylidene fluoride) Mw ~534,000 (PVDF), carbon Vulcan XC-72C, and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) were purchased from Merck and were used to create the electrodes. All reagents were used without further purification. The synthesis of LFP and its composites was carried out as follows: In a microwave vessel, the precursors for LFP were mixed (LiOH, FeSO4\u00b77H2O, and H3PO4, at a molar ratio of 3:1:1) as described in the literature [12,33]. To this mix, we added different weight percentages of CNF and CNC separately for further comparisons, until a homogeneous suspension was formed. First, the LiOH was put into the vessel with ultrapure water until full dissolution, and then H3PO4 was added to form Li3PO4. The next step was to incorporate the NC and mix it for a few minutes. Finally, FeSO4\u00b77H2O was added until full dissolution; ultrapure water and ethanol were then used to fill the total vessel volume (25 mL maximum) and fix the pH of the solution between 6.5 and 8.1, since at this pH a pure LFP phase can be obtained [34,35]. For synthesis without NC, the incorporation of this material in the vessel was omitted. The vessel with the mixed precursor was put into the CE Corporation Discover SP microwave, where 200 W and 17.2 bars were the experimental power and pressure conditions to control the reaction, respectively. Different temperatures and reaction times were selected to analyse the formation of LFP through this route. After the microwave reaction, the mixture was washed and centrifuged several times with deionised water, before being left to dry overnight and obtain LFP or LFP/NC powder. To obtain the LFP/C composites, the powder obtained in the previous step (LFP/NC) was put into a tube furnace for heat treatment at 600 \u25e6C for 1 h, with a N2 atmosphere (99.9% yield, from Indura, Chile). Morphological characterisations were carried out with field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) using an FEI microscope (model: Quanta FEG 250) and transmission electron microscopy (Philips CM200) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV and a point resolution of 0.235 nm. FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out using a Nicolet iS10 (Thermo Scientific) between 4000 and 400 cm\u22121 wavelengths, using KBr pellets at 1:100% wt. Raman spectra were used to analyse the presence of carbon in the created composites using a WITec Alpha 300-RA spectrometer with a 532 nm laser; the D and G bands were deconvoluted with Origin software using Lorentzian curves. XDR diffractograms were measured with a Bruker D8 Advance, with CuK\u03b11 = 1.5604 \u00c5 between 2\u03b8 angles of 10\u25e6 and 80\u25e6, with 0.20\u25e6 intervals. Rietveld refinements were analysed using FullProf Suite software. The XPS characterisation was performed with a Devi-sim (SPECS) near-ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy instrument operating under ultrahigh vacuum, comprising a Phoibos 150-NAP hemispherical analyser and a monochromatic Al K\u03b1 X-ray (h\u03c5 = 1486.6 eV) source. A flood gun was used for charge compensation. Binding energies were calibrated to the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV; for background subtraction, a Shirley background was used, and for data treatment CasaXPS software was used to fit the spectral curves to pseudo-Voigt lineshapes. The cathode formation was accomplished as follows: A mix of active material (LFP/C), PVDF, and conductive carbon (Vulcan XC-72) at a weight proportion of 8:1:1 was added to NMP in order to form a homogeneous solution through stirring for 1 h. Then, the slurry was placed onto the aluminium foil with a specific thickness of 100 \u00b5m, using the Dr Blade technique. Then, the foil was dried and cut into electrodes of active material of 11 mm in diameter. Coin cell assemblies were prepared inside a glovebox using metallic Li of 13 mm in diameter for the counter and reference electrodes, two drops of electrolyte were\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2628 4 of 16\nused per cell (1.0 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC 50/50 v/v), and polyethylene (PE) was employed as the separator. Cyclic voltammetry was carried out using an Ivium Vertex X.S, between 2.8 and 4.1 V versus Li/Li+ at 0.1 mVs\u22121.

The crystalline face (020), which is the crystalline face responsible for the lithium-ion diffusion [34], increased in intensity when NC was used in the synthesis in all cases but did not increase in the samples without carbon and heat treatment.

This difference may be due to the heat treatment used, because the amount of NC incorporated in the composite is carbonised; this process could lead to the LFP material being unrecovered when a low amount is used (like 0.15% wt.), whereas using a higher amount of NC (1% wt.) makes this less likely. When we compare CNC and CNF, we can observe wider peaks when using CNF rather than CNC; thus, we can expect smaller crystallites with CNF and, consequently, smaller particles. In order to evaluate this parameter, FE-SEM images were taken. Figure 2 shows the FE-SEM images obtained with CNC and CNF (samples N1 to N16).

This indicates that working with a lower percentage of NC (0.15% wt.) is not sufficient to avoid agglomerations and improve the growth nuclei, leading to larger particle sizes in comparison with when a higher percentage of NC is used.

NC (Figure 3). It can be observed that the typical D and G signals associated with defects in carbon species were observed only in composite materials, and not with the LFP synthesised without NC, indicating the presence of carbon derived only from NC in the synthesis. The vibrations at 950, 1000, and 1070 cm\u22121 correspond to the three characteristic bands of the phosphate group reported previously in LFP [24], which were not observed in the LFP compound synthesised by the proposed route. Instead, two vibrations were present at 984 and 1033 cm\u22121, which were attributed to the decomposition of LiFePO4 into \u03b3Li3Fe2(PO4)3, and the bands at 214 and 276 cm\u22121 were attributed to the oxidation of the compound to \u03b1-Fe2O3 as a result of the laser intensity used in the Raman technique [21,41,42]. These vibrations were weakly observed in the composites formed with both CNC and CNF, confirming that the use of a carbon coating on the LFP particles protects against the decomposition or oxidation of the materials. This can also be confirmed by detecting the 948 cm\u22121 vibration of the sample with CNC (Figure 3A; red line), because this band corresponds to the characteristic bands of the phosphate group in LFP. To evaluate the quality of the carbon obtained in the composite, the ratios of the Dand G-band intensities (ID/IG) were measured, where the D band is attributed to disordered carbon bands and the G band to graphitic carbon [43]. A low band ratio is expected to be beneficial for good LFP cathode performance [44], as it would mean that there are more graphitic species (G bands) than amorphous species (D bands). The ratio values for CNF and CNC were 0.72 and 0.84, respectively; therefore, with CNF, we can obtain major graphitic species due to the carbon derived from NC starting to decay during thermal treatment, leaving the material unprotected. Thus, as CNC fibres are shorter than CNF fibres, the graphitic species of the composite decline more significantly in CNC compared to CNF. These results confirm that CNF is a better option for obtaining LFP/C composites with smaller particle size and major graphitic carbon species.

It was observed that\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2628 8 of 16\nboth NCs had the same pattern: a weight loss between 40 and 250 \u25e6C that could be attributed to internal water evaporation following glass transition, due to its endothermic behaviour in DSC [45,46]. A second weight loss took place between 250 and 450 \u25e6C for the carbonisation of NC into carbon compounds, followed by a continued weight loss due to the decomposition of the carbon material, indicating that carbonisation at 600 \u25e6C causes a continuous decomposition of carbon to occur, validating the results of the RAMAN and XDR analyses. In order to determine the percentage of carbonised carbon after the thermal treatment in the LFP/C powder composites created in the 150 \u25e6C and 30 min reaction, an elemental analysis was carried out.

Carbon Obtained in LFP/C Powder\nN6 CNC 1 6.8 N8 CNF 1 12.6\nThe carbon obtained after heat treatment was 6.8% wt. with CNC and 12.6% wt. with CNF, confirming that CNC decomposes faster than CNF due to its shorter fibres [47]. This difference in carbon also explains the variation in particle size observed: 369 nm with CNC and 95 nm with CNF, because having less carbon in the composite could lead to LFP particles increasing their size faster than with a higher amount of carbon in the composite, indicating that CNF is a better material to be used for obtaining LFP compounds. In order to confirm this, an equal percentage of carbon (4% wt.) in an LFP/C powder composite was synthesised. Figure 4A shows the diffractograms of both composites, with peaks of only LFP, proving the presence of an olivine structure with the space group Pnma formed with the same percentage of carbon (4% wt.

Figure 5A shows the cyclic voltammetry (black line) of the composite and of LFP synthesised without NC (i.e., carbon; red line).

Before cycling, the iron 2+ species could be clearly identified, but after cycling additional signals appeared that could be attributed to different oxidation states of iron: 0, 2+, and 3+, ue to their respective binding energies of 707, 710, and 713 eV. The presence of iron 3+ is expected for the charging and discharging process of a coin cell. The iron changes its oxidation state from 2+ to 3+; therefore, when the cycling is ended and open-circuit potential is achieved, the amounts of iron 2+ and 3+ should be very similar [52,54], since it is not fully charged (Fe3+) and not fully discharged (Fe2+). These results indicate that the composite loses the reversibility of the Fe2+/Fe3+ signals after cycling, appearing with other species such as FeOOH or Fe (0) [55], since these elements do not actively participate i the intercalation process of the LFP, which could be the main reason for the specific capacity achieved. If we compare these results with those of previous works (Table S3), the synthesis conditions reported in this work facilitates obtaining LFP using low temperatures, without unnecessary reagents to prevent iron oxidation (e.g., ascorbic acid), and an in situ carbon coating with organic and sustainable materials such as NC to easily obtain an LFP/C composite. Other synthesis routes use higher temperatures that are detrimental to the synthesis, such as solid-state, ex situ coatings with inorganic and toxic compounds. However, the incorporation of insufficient carbon coating in the LFP/C composite, which improves the reincorporation of lithium ions inside the LiFePO4 structure, could lead to iron 3+ or iron 0 species, affecting the specific capacity observed. Therefore, subsequent investigations of homogeneous coatings will be crucial to improve the specific capacity of LFP materials created through this proposed synthesis route.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2628 12 of 16 Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 16\n(A) (B)\n(C) (D)\nFigure 8.

Between the two NCs used, CNC exhibited better diffraction peaks in XRD than CNF, but we observed wide peaks with CNF, indicating smaller crystallites and, consequently, smaller particles, as evidenced by the FE-SEM images. Comparing the different percentages of NC used, it should be noted that small percentages (i.e., 0.15% wt. NC) can lead to unwanted diffraction peaks due to the possibility of iron oxidation when a small amount of NC is carbonised. In contrast, with a high percentage of NC (i.e., 1% wt.), no unwanted diffraction peaks were observed, but this does not guarantee a proportional decrease in average particle size, and in some cases with CNC an increase in particle size was observed. Both NCs carbonised to carbon in an inert atmosphere, but through Raman and elemental analysis of the carbon we concluded that CNC decomposes faster than CNF, leading to increase in particle size and a decrease in the final amount of carbon obtained (% wt. carbon in LFP/C composite) when using the same percentage of each NC in the reactor vessel, which is consistent with the results of CV experiments with the same amount of final carbon. As a consequence, the use of CNF instead of CNC in the LFP synthesis shows promising characteristics for use as a cathode: the composite created at 150 \u25e6C for 30 min with 1% wt. CNF had 12.6% wt. carbon after heat treatment. The electrochemical characterisations of the composite showed improved behaviour compared with the LFP synthesised without carbon, confirming that the coating of the LFP particles improves the Li+ intercalation behaviour, while a reduced particle size improves the voltammetry profile and the charge\u2013discharge curves. Through the XPS spectra, it can be seen that the synthesised composite (LFP/C) exhibits only Fe2+ species, while after cycling a coin cell of this compound, other iron species such as Fe3+ and Fe0 can be observed, indicating that inactive species are formed once the coin cell is cycled, which may be responsible for the specific capacity achieved. Through this proposed synthesis route, we can easily obtain an LFP/C composite, avoiding unnecessary chemicals and multiple steps, and the resultant material shows promise for use as a cathode due to its small particle size (95 nm), carbon coating, and good electrochemical behaviour according to cyclic voltammetry. Homogeneity of the carbon coating might be the main issue to achieve better capacity, and this should be investigated in further research in order to obtain particles that are fully covered by conductive material.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym15122628/s1, Figure S1: FT-IR characterisation of different synthesis conditions of LFP by the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method; Table S1: Average particle size of the N samples, as measured using ImageJ software; Figure S2: FE-SEM images of LFP samples synthesised with ethanol as a reducing agent under different synthesis conditions: (a) 150 \u25e6C for 15 min; (b) 150 \u25e6C for 30 min; (c) 205 \u25e6C for 15 min.
