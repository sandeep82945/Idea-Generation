    "abstractText": "Immunosuppression non-adherence is a major cause of graft failure after liver transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate practice surrounding conversion from immediate-release to prolonged-release Tacrolimus formulation and to assess patient adherence and quality of life (QoL). One hundred and seven adult liver transplant recipients, receiving immediate-release Tacrolimus for a minimum of 6 months, were converted to prolonged-release formulation, based on a dose ratio of one (1:1). The median follow-up was 120 [IQR, 120\u2013123] months. Tacrolimus dosage and blood level, liver and renal function, lipid and glucose profiles were recorded. In addition, questionnaires were submitted to evaluate adherence and QoL following conversion. No rejection was recorded. The median serum Tacrolimus blood level decreased over 1 month (5.80, [IQR, 2.0\u201310.8] vs. 3.8 [IQR, 1.4\u20138.7]; p < 0.0005). Significant improvement in renal function was noted (median GFR was 81.7 [IQR, 43.4\u2013128.6] vs. 73.9 [IQR, 27.1\u2013130.2]; p = 0.0002). At the end of the follow-up, conversion resulted in an overall decrease in non-adherence of 53.3% (p = 0.0001) and an improvement in QoL was reported by 76.2% of patients. Thus, 1:1 conversion from immediate to prolonged-release Tacrolimus is safe, feasible and efficient, avoiding under-therapeutic and toxic peak concentrations, improving renal function, adherence to immunosuppression and overall patient QoL.",

Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States\nImmunosuppression non-adherence is a major cause of graft failure after liver transplantation. The aim of this study was to evaluate practice surrounding conversion from immediate-release to prolonged-release Tacrolimus formulation and to assess patient adherence and quality of life (QoL). One hundred and seven adult liver transplant recipients, receiving immediate-release Tacrolimus for a minimum of 6 months, were converted to prolonged-release formulation, based on a dose ratio of one (1:1). The median follow-up was 120 [IQR, 120\u2013123] months. Tacrolimus dosage and blood level, liver and renal function, lipid and glucose profiles were recorded. In addition, questionnaires were submitted to evaluate adherence and QoL following conversion. No rejection was recorded. The median serum Tacrolimus blood level decreased over 1 month (5.80, [IQR, 2.0\u201310.8] vs. 3.8 [IQR, 1.4\u20138.7]; p < 0.0005). Significant improvement in renal function was noted (median GFR was 81.7 [IQR, 43.4\u2013128.6] vs. 73.9 [IQR, 27.1\u2013130.2]; p = 0.0002). At the end of the follow-up, conversion resulted in an overall decrease in non-adherence of 53.3% (p = 0.0001) and an improvement in QoL was reported by 76.2% of patients. Thus, 1:1 conversion from immediate to prolonged-release Tacrolimus is safe, feasible and efficient, avoiding under-therapeutic and toxic peak concentrations, improving renal function, adherence to immunosuppression and overall patient QoL.\nKeywords: liver transplantation, immunosuppression, quality of life, Tacrolimus, adherence\n*Correspondence: Luca Toti\nlucatoti@gmail.com\nReceived: 25 January 2022 Accepted: 24 November 2022 Published: 19 December 2022\nCitation: Toti L, Manzia TM, Blasi F, Lenci I, Baiocchi L, Toschi N and Tisone G (2022) Renal Function, Adherence and Quality of Life Improvement After Conversion From Immediate to Prolonged-Release Tacrolimus in Liver Transplantation: Prospective Ten-Year\nFollow-Up Study.

            "text": "In recent decades, the introduction of new immunosuppressive drugs has contributed to graft survival in solid organ transplantation, decreasing the incidence of acute rejection and thus improving patient survival and quality of life (QoL). However, immunosuppression (IS) has several side-effects including renal failure, infections, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders and de novo malignancies (1-4). In addition, patients are required to follow a complex IS regimen, which includes multiple drugs and personalized daily dose schedules. This therapeutic complexity is often poorly tolerated by patients and is the main cause of non-adherence after solid organ transplantation (5-7), which is estimated at between 15 and 55% (8-10). Therapeutic complexity is also the leading cause of preventable graft loss (4, 11-13). Therefore, simpler treatment regimens, such as once-daily dosing, have been suggested to help improve adherence in transplant recipients (14, 15). Furthermore, prolongedrelease formulations may increase safety profiles avoiding toxic peaks and under therapeutic concentrations, which are observed in narrow therapeutic index drugs, including Tacrolimus (Tac) (16, 17).\nTac is frequently used in liver transplantation (LT). In addition to the immediate-release formulation (IR-Tac, Prograf\u00ae; Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Deerfileld, IL, USA), administered twice daily to maintain stable blood levels,\na prolonged-release (PR-Tac, Advagraf\u00ae, Astellas Pharma Europe BV, Netherlands) formulation was licensed in Europe in 2007 for the prevention and treatment of graft rejection. Conversion from IR to PR-Tac has been studied in maintenance LT recipients (18-21), and the pharmacokinetic of IR-Tac and PR-Tac has been shown to be significantly different.\nThe main aim of this study was to explore tolerability and safety after conversion from IR to PR-Tac in adult LT patients. Secondary endpoints were patient adherence and QoL. Third endpoints were to evaluate the changes in concentration/dose ratio (C/D), C/D intra-patient variability following conversion from IR to PR-Tac, based on a dose ratio of 1 (1:1)."

This tool consists of a four-item validated questionnaire and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The first part\naddresses adherence including timing, missed dose and a \u201cdrug holiday\u201d defined as >24 h interval between two consecutive doses. The VAS is a 100-point score, where patients report adherence in the previous 4 weeks from 0 to 100 (drug therapy never/ always taken as prescribed) thereby assessing adherence as a continuous variable. The BAASIS form was completed by patients once pre-conversion to assess adherence to IR-Tac formulation and again at one- and ten-years following conversion to assess adherence to PR-Tac formulation and tolerability over time.\nA de novo questionnaire (unpublished data) was developed to address those aspects of the IS regimen that influence patient care and the general perception of good or poor QoL in patients taking PR-Tac versus IR-Tac. The questionnaire was designed to be short, simple and easy to understand, to ensure a high completion rate with minimal missing data. The questionnaire, filled in anonymously by patients, collected demographic information (age, gender, and marital and employment status), and included three additional questions. Demographics were collected to facilitate the interpretation of the data at the end of the study. The first question was completed in the preconversion phase and queried the possible difficulty of taking multiple daily doses of drugs using a binary response option (YES/NO). The response was followed by a four-point Likert scale measuring the degree of difficulty, with two positive (very, quite) and two negative (little, very little) quantitative responses. At 12 and 120 months, questions two and three were administered. The second question assessed the possible satisfaction of the new drug regimen using a binary response option (YES/NO). The third question evaluated the perception of an improvement in QoL following the intake of the single-dose drug with a four-point Likert scale measuring the degree of improvement with two positive (very, quite) and two negative (little, very little) quantitative responses.\nA positive response to the first question assumed dissatisfaction with taking multiple daily drugs, which was confirmed by positive responses on the Likert scale. Positive responses to questions 2 and 3 indicated satisfaction with the new therapeutic regimen and increased perception of QoL."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "IR-Tac was considered a pillar of immunosuppressive therapy for solid organ transplantation for nearly 20 years, with excellent protection against organ rejection. Many studies have evaluated the effectiveness of converting from IR-Tac to PR-Tac, the latter able to facilitate adherence, to improve the QoL of transplant recipients and consequently their long-term results. (26, 27). In\nTransplant International | Published by Frontiers December 2022 | Volume 35 | Article 103847\n2005, Florman et al. (6) reported the first conversion pharmacokinetics for stable LT recipients, concluding that the steady-state Tacrolimus exposure of PR-Tac was equivalent to IRTac after conversion on a milligram-for-milligram basis in stable LT recipients.\nIn our study the Tac blood levels decreased following conversion in 76% of cases and remained stable to the end of follow-up, which is similar to previously reported studies (19, 28).\nAn important aspect of this study is the side-effect profile of the anti-rejection drugs correlating to tac blood levels. The initial phase showed a decrease in Tac blood levels over time. Despite this, graft function remained stable with good function and was maintained over time with less side-effects. Time impacted significantly on serum Tac blood levels, which dropped sharply in the early post-conversion period.\nWith normal aging, nephron loss occurs and is detectable to some extent by the age-related decrease in eGFR (29, 30). Several studies that have analyzed the deterioration of renal function with increasing age in the healthy population show that eGFR shows a physiologic decrease between 0.3 and 1.4 ml/min/1.73 m2/year (31, 32). In addition, calcineurin inhibitors, widely recognized as the mainstay of IS used to prevent graft rejection, have an important nephrotoxic sideeffect profile. The expected gradual reduction in eGFR in LT recipients is the result of different mechanisms including immunologically mediated damage concurrent to the IS side-effects, nephrotoxicity and the development of cardiovascular risk factors (29, 33). However, a significant improvement in renal function was seen in our study: using eGFR, a significant effect of the timepoint factor (p < 0.0001) was seen, with a retrospective comparison showing the following differences at baseline vs. 1 month (p < 0.0001), baseline vs. 6 months (p = 0.049), month 1 vs. 6, 12, 60, and 120 (all p < 0.001). There were no new cases of posttransplant diabetes or glucose intolerance or any increase in adverse events associated with Tacrolimus use after conversion to PR-Tac.\nIt can be hypothesized that extended-release Tac may influence drug absorption and avoid drug peaks whilst maintaining adequate drug blood levels to avoid rejection.\nSelf-reporting adherence instruments having a tendency to overestimate adherence and under-report non-adherence due to increased awareness and pleasing the physician. However, BAASIS is considered a valid tool as it uses a rigorous definition of non-adherence, classifying a patient as nonadherent in case of positive answer to any of the four questions to be given. Non-adherence at study entry was considerably high especially regarding the evening dose, which has also been found by previous studies (6,34). At the end of the follow-up, however, these high adherence rates increased even further. The data clearly demonstrate that simply reducing the number of daily doses positively influences adherence leading to improved compliance and patient satisfaction. The important improvement in adherence following conversion to PR-Tac\nformulation is also evidenced in previously published studies. (35-37)\nAdherence rates improved significantly between baseline and the end of the study in terms of missing one or more doses, violating drug timing and autonomous prescription modification. Patients themselves felt more adherent at the end of the study with 97% of patients defining themselves as \u201cadherent\u201d at 120 months compared with 90% at baseline. Patients reported having difficulty taking more than one IS drug in 61.7% of cases before conversion, not knowing about PR-Tac, subsequently, 93.3% defining the PR-Tac regimen as \u201cvery satisfactory.\u201d During medical interviews, 68% referred the evening dose as being the most difficult to self-administer for perceived interference with social life and sense of freedom. This has radically changed following conversion to PR-Tac.\nFreedom of choice relating to time of drug administration directly impacted on perception of improvement in QoL for the majority of patients. QoL improvement was reported in over 82.4% of patients in our study following conversion. The reason why we decided to use a de novo questionnaire, drawn up and validated in collaboration with the Center for Psychology of our hospital, is due to the fact that in the literature, in our opinion, there were no validated questionnaires that had the characteristics, suitable for a complete evaluation of our patients which would allow us to obtain such complete results and which went hand in hand with the BAASIS, used for the assessment of adherence. The fact that no patient enrolled, with the sole constraint of taking IR-Tac for at least 6 months before signing the informed consent to the study, was for us surprising evidence of the excellent relationship of trust that we establish every day with all the people we follow in our post-transplant clinic and further confirmation of the patients\u2019 desire to seek \u201csimpler\u201d therapy regimens to follow.\nDespite the absence of a control group that may evidence bias, we have considered the group itself before conversion as satisfactory for comparison.\nThere is significantly less intrasubject variability in exposure after conversion to PR-Tac: the mean C/D ratio was significantly (p = 0.008) higher pre-conversion as compared to post conversion, while the coefficient of variation of the C/D ratio was significantly (p = 0.003) lower pre-conversion compared to post-conversion, indicating greater stability post-conversion compared to pre-conversion.\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that 1:1 conversion from IR-TAC to PR-TAC is safe, feasible, efficient, and welltolerated. Hepatic and renal function was closely monitored and no major dose adjustment to correct low Tac blood levels were required. Stable LT patients can be successfully switched from IR-Tac to PR-Tac formulation without risk of acute rejection even in the short term. A simplified formulation of Tac can improve patient adherence and their QoL. Improvement of renal function is probably due to lower Tac blood level exposure.\nTransplant International | Published by Frontiers December 2022 | Volume 35 | Article 103848"
