FWB is caused by the soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), which almost 21 annihilated the banana production in the late 1950s. A new strain of Foc, known as tropical race 4 22 (TR4), attacks a wide range of banana varieties including Cavendish clones which are the source of 23 99% of banana exports. In 2019, Foc TR4 was reported in Colombia, and more recently (2021) in Peru. 24 In this study, we sequenced three fungal isolates identified as Foc TR4 from La Guajira (Colombia) and 25 compared them against 19 whole-genome sequences of Foc TR4 publicly available, including four 26 genome sequences recently released from Peru. To understand the genetic relatedness of the 27 Colombian Foc TR4 isolates and those from Peru, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on a 28\ngenome-wide set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Additionally, we compared the genomes 29 of the 22 available Foc TR4 isolates looking for the presence-absence of gene polymorphisms and 30 genomic regions. Our results reveal that (i) the Colombian and Peruvian isolates are genetically 31 distant, which could be better explained by independent incursions of the pathogen to the continent, 32 and (ii) there is a high correspondence between the genetic relatedness and geographic origin of Foc 33 TR4. The profile of present/absent genes and the distribution of missing genomic regions showed a 34 high correspondence to the clades recovered in the phylogenetic analysis, supporting the results 35 obtained by SNP-based phylogeny. 36\n37\nIntroduction 38\nThe global banana export industry generates around 14.5 billion USD per year (FAOSTAT 2020). 39 Approximately 51% of global production is of the Cavendish cultivar (Lescot 2018). Latin America and 40 the Caribbean (LAC) constitutes the world\u2019s most important exporting region for bananas. During 41 2018, the total production volume of bananas in LAC was estimated at 30 million tonnes and 13 million 42 tonnes were exported to developed countries, mainly the United States of America and the European 43 Union. In Colombia, banana is the country\u2019s third most important export crop after coffee and flowers. 44 Approximately 91% of the national banana production is destined for export. Five departments 45 concentrate almost 75% of the national production. In 2019, Antioquia was the department with the 46 largest production of banana, with a cultivated area of 40,000 ha (42% of the total cultivated area of 47 the nation), followed by Magdalena (14%), Nari\u00f1o (9%), Valle del Cauca (7%) and La Guajira (3%) 48 (Statistics home 2014). 49\nFusarium wilt of banana (FWB), one of the most devastating diseases of bananas, is threatening the 50 global export industry. The disease, caused by the soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. 51 cubense (Foc), was first reported in Australia in 1876 (Bancroft 1876). The devastation caused by Foc 52 race 1 (R1) was mitigated in the late 1950s by the substituting Gros Michel with resistant Cavendish 53 cultivars, which now account for nearly all banana exports. However, a newly emerging lineage of Foc, 54 known as tropical race 4 (TR4) corresponding to vegetative compatibility group VCG 01213/16, attacks 55 Cavendish clones and a wide range of other banana varieties. Foc TR4 was first detected in Taiwan in 56 1967 (Hwang and Ko 2004; Su et al. 1977), after most likely being introduced on infected plants from 57 Sumatra, Indonesia, and subsequently spread widely in banana-producing countries (Ploetz et al. 58 2015; Ploetz 2015). Foc TR4 was restricted to Australasia from 1990 when it was formally recognized 59 until 2013 when it was first reported in Jordan, and Mozambique (Butler 2013). In 2015 it emerged in 60 Lebanon, Oman, India and Pakistan (Viljoen et al. 2020; Ordo\u00f1ez et al. 2016; Thangavelu et al. 2019; 61\nPloetz et al. 2015). Between 2017 and 2019, Foc TR4 was found in Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar and 62 Thailand (Ordo\u00f1ez et al. 2016; Garc\u00eda-Bastidas et al. 2014; Acu\u00f1a et al. 2021; Chittarath et al. 2018; 63 Hung et al. 2018; Zheng et al. 2018; Latest Pest Reports 2019). According to official information, Foc 64 TR4 is currently confirmed in 22 countries (CABI ISC 2021), predominantly in South and Southeast Asia. 65 In 2019, the pathogen was reported for the first time in Colombia, reaching out to the American 66 continent (Garc\u00eda-Bastidas et al. 2020; Viljoen et al. 2020), and more recently in Peru (Acu\u00f1a et al. 67 2021). Foc TR4 was detected on a banana plantation in the northeastern region of La Guajira, 68 Colombia. Currently, eleven farms in La Guajira and one in Magdalena are confirmed for the presence 69 of Foc TR4. Consequently the 0.32 % of banana producing region in the country is under quarantine 70 due to the presence Foc TR4. 71\nUnderstanding the phylogenetic relationships among geographically disparate isolates can provide 72 clues about a pathogen\u2019s chains of transmission. An understanding of the genetic diversity and 73 relationships with other organisms is important for rational design of molecular assays for detection 74 and identification. Taxonomy is important for implementation of control measures such as notification 75 and quarantine. 76\nRecently, the use of high-throughput genome-sequencing technologies has made important 77 contributions to studies on Foc TR4, particularly on genetic diversity (Maymon et al. 2020; Ordonez et 78 al. 2015) and phylogeographical analysis (Zheng et al. 2018). Ordo\u00f1ez and colleagues (Ordo\u00f1ez 2018; 79 Ordonez et al. 2015) performed a hierarchical clustering analysis based on 4,298 DArTseq markers 80 showing a limited genetic diversity between multiple Foc TR4 isolates from countries in the Middle 81 East, Asia and Oceania (China, Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines and 82 Australia). Genomic comparison of Foc TR4 isolates from the Greater Mekong subregion (Zheng et al. 83 2018) identified three geographically distinct clusters, one of which constituted isolates from Laos, 84 Vietnam, Myanmar and China; this suggested that the source of infection in the Greater Mekong 85 subregion probably originated from China. Most recently, a phylogeographical study conducted by 86 Maymon and colleagues (Maymon et al. 2020), using SNPs across the whole genome, principal 87 component analyses (PCA) and hierarchical clustering, claimed a strong similarity between the 88 Colombian isolates and the Indonesian isolate II-5. The authors argued that this suggests that the 89 pathogen most likely spread to Colombia from Indonesia (Maymon et al. 2020). A recent genomic 90 comparison of Indian Foc isolates belonging to races 1, 2 and 4 revealed differences in the repertoire 91 of SIX genes in Indian Foc TR4 compared with Foc TR4 isolated elsewhere (Raman et al. 2021). 92\nPrevious work (Maymon et al. 2020) suggested that the source of the Colombian Foc TR4 outbreak 93 might be Indonesia. It is likely that the Foc TR4 lineage first arose in that part of the world (Bentley et 94\nal. 1998; V\u00e9zina 2014) and in that sense, Indonesia might ultimately be the origin of all Foc TR4. 95 However, it remains unclear as to what routes Foc TR4 has taken to disseminate across and between 96 continents. Furthermore, misattribution of the pathogen\u2019s source may have important economic and 97 political consequences; so, any such claims require careful scrutiny. Therefore, the aims of this study 98 were (i) to evaluate the SNP genetic diversity between Colombian isolates and those from elsewhere, 99 including genome sequences for three additional Colombian isolates, four from Peru and other 100 sequence data that were not available at the time of the previous study (Maymon et al. 2020), and (ii) 101 to identify new genomic differences/similarities between TR4 isolates able to support the SNP-based 102 phylogeny. For this, we sequenced the genomes of the three additional Foc TR4 isolates using Oxford 103 Nanopore Technologies\u2019 MinION platform. Our genomic comparison analyses revealed that outbreaks 104 in Peru and Colombia are genetically distinct and likely have different origins. We generate a catalogue 105 of genes/regions whose presence is variable among Foc TR4 pathogen individuals that will be useful 106 resource for future study. 107\n108\nResults and Discussion 109 The Foc TR4 variant of Fusarium wilt has been detected in two South American countries, namely Peru 110 and Colombia. This lineage of the pathogen likely emerged initially in Indonesia or Malaysia (Bentley 111 et al. 1998; V\u00e9zina 2014) and has subsequently undergone a number of intercontinental transmission 112 events. Each of these events presumably involved a founder population that represents a tiny sample 113 of the pathogen population\u2019s genetic diversity, leading to a genetic bottleneck at each introduction to 114 a new geographical location. Until recently, Foc TR4 was unknown in Latin America. This raises the 115 question of whether recent outbreaks in the two South American countries are linked in a direct chain 116 of transmission or whether they represent separate introductions. The \u2018bottleneck\u2019 effect of 117 introduction from the Foc TR4 population in its centre of origin predicts that directly linked outbreaks 118 would involve genetically similar pathogen individuals, whereas independent samples from the that 119 original population would be relatively divergent from each other. We compared isolates from 120 Colombia with previously sequenced isolates from elsewhere, using genome-wide sequence data to 121 maximise the resolution of the genetic relationships. 122\nGenome sequencing of Colombian Foc TR4 isolates 123 We generated approximately 17 Gb of long-read data for each Colombian Foc TR4 isolate. The 124 sequence reads have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive under the BioProject accession 125 number PRJNA774343 (BioSample accession numbers SAMN22562322, SAMN22562323 and 126 SAMN22562324). These genomic reads were aligned against the UK0001 Foc TR4 reference genome 127\nsequence and the resulting alignments were used for calling SNPs for phylogenetic analysis and for 128 surveying differentially present/absent genes. 129\n130\nPresence/absence of SIX genes in the Colombian Foc TR4 genomes 131 During the last ten years, several studies have developed molecular markers for detection of Foc TR4 132 (Matthews et al. 2020; Magdama et al. 2019; Ndayihanzamaso et al. 2020; Dita et al. 2010; Aguayo et 133 al. 2017; Lin et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013; Carvalhais et al. 2019). This raises an important question: Are 134 the existing molecular markers present in the Colombian Foc TR4 genomes? We investigated whether 135 the secreted in xylem SIX genes (SIX1 \u2013 SIX13) were present/absent in Colombian Foc TR4 isolates. For 136 this, a BLAST analysis was carried out using SIX gene sequences against the 190098, 190203 and 03242 137 Colombian genome assemblies. All sequences were present in all three Colombian Foc TR4 genomes. 138 SIX-gene homologues from SIX1 to SIX13 showed different levels of similarity, ranging from 98 to 139 100%, to those of our sequenced isolates (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, SIX6 and SIX9 genes 140 presented low percentage similarities of 91 and 88%, respectively. 141\n142\nColombian isolates constitute a distinct clade distinct from Peruvian isolates 143 We identified 671 single-nucleotide sites in the Foc TR4 genome that showed variation and for which 144 the allele could be unambiguously determined in every one of the examined genomes. On the basis 145 of these 671 SNPs (Supplementary File S2), we constructed the maximum-likelihood phylogeny shown 146 in Figure 1. This phylogenetic tree displayed a clear correspondence between genetic relatedness and 147 geographic origin. For example, there is a clade comprising isolates from the Middle East. Notably, 148 isolates from South America are distributed among two distinct clades. The six isolates from Colombia 149 comprise a single clade; similarly, the four isolates from Peru comprise another distinct clade. 150 Colombian isolates are genetically much more distant from Peruvian isolates than they are from 151 isolates collected in the Middle East and the United Kingdom. This phylogeographic pattern is not 152 consistent with a single introduction of Foc TR4 from its centre of origin into South America and 153 subsequent spread within the continent. Rather, it is better explained by separate, independent 154 incursions into Colombia and Peru. 155\nOur phylogenetic analysis revealed that the six Colombian isolates are much more closely related to 156 each other than they are to any previously sequenced isolates from other geographic locations. In 157 other words, there is greater genetic differentiation between than within geographical regions. 158 Furthermore, there is no close relationship between Colombian isolates and isolates from elsewhere; 159 Colombian isolates are genetically approximately equidistant to each of the other isolates. Therefore, 160\nthere is no genetic evidence of a direct source of the incursion of Foc TR4 into the Americas; the 161 lineage comprising the Colombian isolates probably diverged from the lineages isolated elsewhere 162 prior to the emergence of Foc TR4 outside of its centre of origin (whose location is unknown but likely 163 to lie in Indonesia and/or Malaysia). The phylogenetic tree is consistent with several independent 164 intercontinental transmissions of Foc TR4 from its origin. Similarly, within China and SE Asia, all 165 sequenced isolates are closer to each other than to isolates from elsewhere, suggesting a single egress 166 of Foc TR4 into that region. Similarly, most of the isolates from countries in the Middle East are 167 genetically close and may have arisen from a single inoculum. In conclusion, the phylogenetic analysis 168 is consistent with a single source of Foc TR4 into the Americas and shows no evidence that this is 169 derived from the Foc TR4 populations seen in other regions where it has emerged. 170\n171\nPatterns of gene content are broadly consistent with phylogeny 172 Based on alignments of genomic reads from Foc TR4 isolates against the UK0001 reference genome 173 sequence, we identified 615 gene presence-absence polymorphisms. These are tabulated as an Excel 174 spreadsheet in Supplementary File S3. The distributions of these variable genes across the sequenced 175 isolates were broadly consistent with phylogeny. Clustering of the genomes based on their profile of 176 present/absent genes showed clusters that corresponded to the clades recovered in the phylogenetic 177 analysis (Figure 2), revealing dozens of genes whose presence or absence is characteristic of specific 178 Foc TR4 clades. This opens the future possibility of developing molecular typing assays to assign 179 isolates to lineages without the need for whole-genome sequencing. Furthermore, it is notable that 180 several genes show presence-absence polymorphism within the Colombian clade, suggesting that 181 gene deletions have taken place very recently during the epidemic, some of which might be adaptive 182 as the fungus finds itself in a new environment with new host genotypes. The biological significance 183 of these differentially present genes is an avenue for future investigation. 184\n185\nComparative genomic analysis reveals sequence gaps shared by Foc TR4 isolates from specific 186\ngeographic locations 187\nA comprehensive genomic analysis can identify components of the Foc TR4 genome that might 188 complement the information provided by the SNP-based phylogeny. In this study, the whole genome 189 assemblies were compared to the published genomes of Foc TR4 (Supplementary Table S4). We 190 compared the genomes of 22 publicly available Foc TR4 isolates with the reference genome assembly 191 of UK0001 (Figure S1). The comparison between the de novo assembled Colombian Foc TR4 shows 192\nthat they do not differ from each other. However, when comparing all Foc TR4 genomes, we observed 193 several major gapped regions located on contigs VMNF0100005.1, VMNF0100007.1, 194 VMNF01000013.1 and VMNF01000014.1 (Figure 3). Specifically, genomic regions that are present on 195 the UK0001 reference genome are missing in (i) the Colombian Foc TR4 isolates (contigs 196 VMNF0100005.1 andVMNF0100007.1); (ii) Middle Eastern isolates from Jordan, Israel and Lebanon 197 (contigs VMNF01000013.1 and VMNF01000014.1); (iii) isolates from China, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos 198 and Peru (VMNF01000014.1). Thus, this comparative genomic analysis also supports the SNP-based 199 phylogeny. 200\n201\nConclusion 202\nPhylogeographic relationships among Foc TR4 worldwide isolates are required to infer the routes of 203 TR4\u2019s transmission between and within continents. In this work, we sequence and obtained a nearly 204 complete genome assembly of three isolated of Foc TR4, obtained from banana plantations of la 205 Guajira in Colombia. Our analysis suggests that Colombian isolates are more closely related to those 206 from the UK and the Middle East and less to those from Per\u00fa. However, the divergences between 207 those three lineages likely occurred prior to the global emergence of Foc TR4 outside its centre of 208 origin, based on the genetic distances seen within geographically distinct lineages. Comparative 209 genomic analysis revealed missing genomic regions that were shared between Foc TR4 isolates 210 belonging to the same clade, also confirming a correspondence between genetic relatedness and 211 geographic origin. 212\n213\nMaterials and methods 214 215 Genome sequence data from public repositories 216 We used the previously published UK0001 genome (Warmington et al. 2019) as the reference 217 sequence for alignment-based analyses as that genome sequence was assembled using long reads and 218 is therefore of high quality. We used genome sequencing reads for previously reported Foc TR4 219 genome sequencing projects from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession numbers SRR10103605, 220 SRR10125423, SRR10747097, SRR9733598, SRR7226880, SRR10054450, SRR10054449, SRR7226881, 221 SRR10054448, SRR10054446, SRR10054447, SRR7226882, SRR7226883, SRR7226879, SRR15514269, 222 SRR15514270, SRR15514271, SRR15514272, SRR550155, SRR550152, SRR7226878 and SRR7226877 223 (Guo et al. 2014; Leinonen et al. 2011; Kodama et al. 2012; Warmington et al. 2019; Maymon et al. 224 2020; Acu\u00f1a et al. 2021; Zheng et al. 2018). 225\nColombian Foc TR4 isolates 226 The Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense TR4 isolates 190098, 03242 and 190203, isolated from 227 symptomatic Cavendish banana from Dibulla, La Guajira state (Colombia) were provided by Instituto 228 Agropecuario Colombiano (ICA). The isolates were maintained in potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 27 \u00b0C. 229\nExtraction of genomic DNA 230 For high molecular weight (HMW) DNA extraction, the Foc TR4 isolates were grown on PDA plates for 231 seven days at 28\u00b0C. Then, propagules were harvested and transferred to Czapek dox medium and 232 incubated for six additional days to produce fungal mycelia. Fungal mycelium was obtained by filtering 233 through two layers of Miracloth and washed twice with 10 mL sterile distilled water. Then, fungal 234 mycelium was freeze-dried overnight and ground in a mortar with a pestle. Five hundred milligrams 235 of ground mycelium were incubated for one hour at 65\u00b0C with 800 \u00b5L fresh DNA extraction buffer and 236 15 \u00b5l de RNAse (10mg/\u00b5l). DNA extraction buffer was prepared by mixing 2.5 volumes of solution A 237 (0.35 M Sorbitol, 0.1 M Tris-base, 5 mM EDTA pH 7.5), 2.5 volumes of solution B (0.2 M Tris, 0.05 M 238 EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 2% CTAB), 1 volume of Sarkosyl (10% w/v) and 1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. To separate 239 the organic phase, 400 \u00b5L of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was added, vortexed for 5 240 minutes and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 5 minutes before centrifugation at 16,000 g for 241 15 min. Two chloroform extractions were used on the aqueous phase by adding 0.5 volumes and 242 centrifuge at 16,000 g for 5 min at RT each time. The aqueous phase was mixed with 10 volumes of 243 100% ice-cold ethanol, incubated for 30 min at RT, and the precipitated DNA was collected in a new 244 tube using a disposable inoculation loop. Collected HMW DNA was washed twice with 1 mL 70% ice-245 cold ethanol and the air-dried DNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water and conserved at 4\u00b0C. The 246 DNA quality, size and quantity were assessed by spectrometry in a NanoDrop 2000 247 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, USA), electrophoresis in agarose gel and 248 fluorometry in a Qubit Fluorometer v2.0 (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) 249\nDNA sequencing 250 Sequencing library was prepared with the Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109) according to the 251 manufacturer instructions (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) using 22 ng HMW DNA. An 252 R9.4.1 flow cell (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) was loaded and run for 48 hours. Base 253 calling was performed using Guppy from MinKNOW (version 4.0.21; Oxford Nanopore Technologies). 254\nGenome assembly 255 For the de novo assembly of Oxford Nanopore Technologies data from three newly sequenced 256 Colombian isolates, we used Canu 2.0 (Koren et al. 2017) and Flye 2.8.2 (Kolmogorov et al. 2019) 257 followed by several iterations of Racon v1.4.3 (Vaser et al. 2017) and medaka 1.2.1 (Oxford Nanopore 258 Technologies Ltd. 2018) to obtain a consensus sequence. The best assembly for each isolate was 259\nselected according to most of the metrics such as BUSCO score (Sim\u00e3o et al. 2015), QUAST genome 260 statistics (Gurevich et al. 2013) and Qualimap (Garc\u00eda-Alcalde et al. 2012). In addition, BlobTools2 261 (Challis et al. 2020) as used to integrate to include coverage, BUSCO, Blast, and DIAMOND v2.0.11 262 (Buchfink et al. 2015) and do contaminant screening and genome assessment. 263\nFor most of the previously sequenced genomes, assemblies were available in the public databases. 264 However, for several isolates, only unassembled sequence reads were available. Assemblies of isolates 265 SRR10125423, SRR10747097, SRR550152, SRR550155, SRR7226877, SRR7226878, SRR7226879, 266 SRR7226880, SRR7226881, SRR7226882, and SRR7226883 were performed using SPAdes and 267 evaluated with Qualimap (Garc\u00eda-Alcalde et al. 2012). For genomes with low numbers of reads 268 (SRR10054447, SRR10054448, SRR10054449, SRR10054450, SRR10103605, SRR15514270, 269 SRR15514271, and SRR15514272) we aligned the reads to the reference genome using Bowtie2 270 (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) and used the mpileup tool in Samtools (Li et al. 2009) to obtain a 271 consensus sequence from the alignment. MUMmer4 was used to align the whole genome assemblies 272 to the reference genome UK0001. Then, we used Circos to visualize the alignments in a circular 273 representation. 274\nAligning sequence reads against reference genome sequence 275\nTo mitigate problems arising from incompleteness and errors in de novo assembly of short sequence 276 reads, we used a genome-comparison strategy based on aligning sequencing reads against a high-277 quality reference genome sequence. For this assembly-free genomic comparison, we acquired short-278 read whole-genome Illumina sequence data as FastQ files (Cock et al. 2010) for Fusarium oxysporum 279 f. sp. cubense from the SRA database (Kodama et al. 2012). The quality of the sequencing data was 280 evaluated using FASTQC (Andrews n.d.). Reads with low quality or containing adaptor sequences were 281 trimmed using Trim Galore (Babraham Bioinformatics - Trim Galore! 2022) or Canu (Koren et al. 2017) 282 as appropriate to the sequencing method that generated the data. The sequences were aligned 283 against the reference genome of isolate UK0001 (GenBank:GCA_007994515) using the Burrows 284 Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (Li and Durbin 2010, 2009) and Minimap2 (Li 2018). The alignments were 285 evaluated with Qualimap (Garc\u00eda-Alcalde et al. 2012). 286\nSNP-calling and phylogeny reconstruction 287\nWe used a genome-wide survey of SNPs towards understanding the relationship between Colombian 288 Foc TR4 isolates and those from other geographical locations. 289\nSingle-nucleotide sites that showed sequence variability between Foc TR4 isolates (i.e. candidate 290 SNPs) were identified using Pilon (Walker et al. 2014). There was some variation in the level of 291 confidence in the nucleotide sequences at these candidate SNPs. For example, at some sites, there 292\nwas not a consensus among the multiple sequence reads aligned at that site. Therefore, candidate 293 SNPs were filtered to retain only high-confidence SNPs with read-consensus above 95%, using a Perl 294 script available at https://github.com/davidjstudholme/SNPsFromPileups. Full details of the 295 command lines are given in Appendix 1 at the end of this document. Genomes were assigned to 296 genetic types (haplotypes) according to the combination of nucleotide-states found at each of the 297 high-confidence SNPs. These were represented as files in FastA and Nexus formats. A PhyML tree was 298 generated in IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al. 2015) using the GTR model (Tavare 1986; Gouy et al. 2010; 299 Guindon et al. 2010). The robustness of the phylogeny was assessed using 1000 bootstrap replicates. 300\nComparison of gene content 301 We identified genes in the UK0001 reference genome that were absent from one or more sequenced 302 isolates (i.e. presence-absence polymorphisms) from the BWA alignments using the coverageBed tool 303 in BEDtools (Quinlan and Hall 2010). This tool reports the breadth of coverage by aligned sequence 304 reads for each gene. This approach, based on aligning reads against a reference genome, avoids 305 problems arising from incompleteness of de-novo genome assemblies. 306\n307\nAuthor contributions 308 The study was conceived by MS-S and MB.

The rows represent 488 615 predicted protein-coding genes in the UK0001 reference genome that are absent from at least 489 one TR4 genome; that is, differentially present/absent genes. The presence or absence of each gene 490 was assessed in each genome based on breadth of coverage by genomic sequencing reads, using the 491 coverageBed tool (Quinlan and Hall 2010); this generates a value between zero (no reads, i.e. 492 absent) and one (completely covered by reads, i.e. present). The columns (i.e. genomes) are ordered 493 according to by complete linkage clustering. Rows (i.e. genes) are ordered according to genomic 494 location. 495\nFigure 3.
