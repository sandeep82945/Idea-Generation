All mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat. For the obesity with nonexercise microbiome transplantation group, feces from donors that did not undergo exercise were administered. For the obesity with exercise microbiome transplantation group, feces from donors who underwent exercise were administered. Treadmill exercise started 16 weeks after the intake of the high fat feeding and continued for 24 weeks. The short-term memory and spatial learning memory were determined by step-down avoidance test and Morris water maze task, immunohistochemistry for glial fibril-\nlary acidic protein, western blot analysis for brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin receptor kinase B were performed in the hippocampus. Exercise was the most effective way to reduce obesity, improve memory function, suppress inflammation, and increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression. Intestinal microbiota transplantation was the second most effective after exercise. However, there was no significant difference in the fecal microbiota transplant group according to whether or not exercise was performed.\nKeywords: Obesity, Microbiome, Microbiota transplant, Exercise, Memory"

            "text": "Obesity is an excessive accumulation of body fat due to excessive caloric intake, lack of balanced energy consumption, hormonal abnormalities, psychological and environmental factors. Obesity increases the production of cytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 that are involved in inflammation as well as metabolic disorders and various diseases (Weisberg et al., 2003).\nThere are about 70 trillion microbiomes in the human body that weigh between 1 and 2 kg (Stilling et al., 2014). The microbiome is also primarily influenced by genetic factors, but acquired factors such as dietary habits, antibiotic abuse and lifestyle are more influential (Stilling et al., 2014). The term microbiome combines the terms microbe (microorganism) and biome (a biogeographic\nunit made up of a biological community) to contain the genetic information of microorganisms in the human body. The first study of a potential link between the microbiome and obesity was by Turnbaugh et al. (2006). Microbiome studies have investigated the role of the microbiome of healthy and young individuals on aging (Smith et al., 2017), obesity (Goodrich et al., 2014), and brain cognitive function (Mayer et al., 2015).\nLactobacillus is a microorganism that suppresses intestinal pathogens, reduces cholesterol, and enhances the immune system of the human body. Lactobacillus acidophilus, a type of Lactobacillus bacteria, plays a role in improving insulin resistance (Anderson et al., 2012). Lactobacillus gasseri acts by reducing adiponectin and subcutaneous fat (Kadooka et al., 2010). Lactobacillus plantarum is known to reduce the size and weight of adipocytes (Takemura et al., 2010). Lactobacillus bacteria are known to influence obesity\nhttps://doi.org/10.12965/jer.2244272.136\nOriginal Article\nJournal of Exercise Rehabilitation 2022;18(3):162-170\nhttps://www.e-jer.org 163https://doi.org/10.12965/jer.2244272.136\nthrough a microbiome that alters obesity induction and control in the presence or absence of Christensenellaceae bacteria (Goodrich et al., 2014). In contrast, there are certain microbiota that cause obesity. The best known are Firmicutes and Bactroidetes. The former activates enzymes that store fat while consuming caloric energy, while the latter leads to inefficient consumption of caloric energy (Hjorth et al., 2018). The association between obesity and the microbiome was reported by Rajili\u0107-Stojanovi\u0107 et al. (2015). The microbiome has been shown to increase ghrelin and insulin secretion from the pancreas as short fatty acid chains act on the hypothalamus through the brain blood barrier. This means that obesity control not only involves the gut, but also requires an interaction between the gut and the brain.\nAerobic exercise is recommended for fat loss (Cox et al., 2004). In particular, the most effective exercise recommended for obesity reduction is low-intensity aerobic exercise (Donnelly et al., 2004). Cook et al. (2016) reported that physical activity induces changes in the gut environment to improve gut immune function. Physical activity has been shown to alter the composition and function of the gut microbiota (Allen et al., 2018).\nChanges in the intestinal environment and changes in the microbiome have been suggested as causes of obesity. Therefore, this study attempted to investigate the association between changes in the intestinal environment and the brain using a model that received aerobic exercise and microbiota transplantation."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "In this experiment, it was found that exercise had the greatest effect on obesity. Transplantation of the fecal microbiome from exercised mice and fecal microbiome from non-exercised mice was the second most effective in obesity after exercise performance.\nThe composition of the microbiome in the body has been proposed to determine the degree of obesity induction (Hjorth et al., 2018). In general, energy intake leads to blood sugar control by insulin, and in the case of obesity, an abnormality in the insulin control system accelerates the accumulation of excess energy. Insulin resistance is directly affected by type 2 diabetes and obesity. As the level of obesity increases, so does the level (Glynn et al., 2015). In a study comparing the obesity group and the direct exercise group after obesity induction, and the microbiome group, the latter group showed improvement in insulin resistance in OGTT, which had a positive effect on glucose control. Microbiota transplantation has been shown to induce changes in the recipient\u2019s gut environment and improve insulin sensitivity (Vrieze et al., 2012). Direct or indirect effects on obesity induction or inhibition. Although the mechanisms of regulation may differ from exercise, microbiota transplantation has been shown to affect insulin sensitivity and regulation as well as exercise. Simon et al. (2015) reported that insulin regulation was affected by Lactobacillus strains, particularly Lactobacillus reuteri, and this study also showed that it was involved in increasing beneficial bacteria and improving insulin sensitivity. This suggested that with exercise, the microbiome should be enhanced for maximum effect in controlling obesity.\nBDNF has been reported to be associated with obesity and cognitive function (Prickett et al., 2015). BDNF is a neurotrophic factor and a type of neuronutrient that plays an important role in the growth and development of nerve cells and cognitive function (Tsai et al., 2014). TrkB is a BDNF receptor, and dysfunction of TrkB is known to cause diseases such as depression, neurodegenerative disorders, obesity, and eating disorders (Gray et al., 2006).\nIn this study, BDNF and TrkB levels were increased as a result of comparing the exercise group and the microbiome transplant group. The increase has been shown to be more effectively mediated by direct locomotion than by microbiota transplantation. The increase in BDNF due to microbial transplantation causes changes in the Bifidobacterium community, which plays an important role in central nervous system development and neuronal growth (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011; Sudo et al., 2004).\nMicrobiome analysis was performed to determine the effects of exercise and microbiota transplantation. Specifically, L. acidophilus, L. gasseri, Christensenellaceae, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Oscillibacter were set as variables for microbiome analysis. Goodrich et al. (2014) reported that obesity control is influenced by Christensenella bacteria, whereas Bacteroidetes acts to induce inefficient calorie consumption in the body (Hjorth et al., 2018). In this study, it was found that the level of harmful Firmicutes bacteria caused by obesity was significantly lower in the group transplanted with intestinal microbes. L. acidophilus, L. gasseri, and Christensenellaceae, which are beneficial bacteria, control obesity, promote lipid metabolism, and are also involved in anti-inflammatory action (Million et al., 2012; Rouxinol-Dias et al., 2016). L. gasseri has an antiobesity effect, and the obesity-reducing effect is thought to be due to the increase through microbiome transplantation and exercise. Kadooka et al. (2010), L. gasseri has been reported to play a role in suppressing obesity in both animals and humans. The Christensenellaceae are abundant in healthy weight groups and their levels increase after weight loss through diet control, indicating their role in obesity control (Alem\u00e1n et al., 2018; Goodrich et al., 2014). Both the exercise group and the intestinal microbial transplant group showed an increase in the rhododendron family compared to the obesity control group, suggesting that both treatments were effective in strengthening the intestinal microflora to reduce obesity. Similarly, in this study, direct exercise and microbiota transplantation were found to be effective in increasing the levels of obesity-related beneficial bacteria and antiobesity bacteria. Osilybacter is known to affect brain cognitive function, which is reduced in levels through obesity (Olsthoorn et al., 2021).\nObesity induction increases inflammation levels and intestinal permeability and activates the immune system (Muscogiuri et al., 2019), whereas inflammation is thought to affect brain cognitive function. Increased inflammatory gene expression in the prefrontal cortex in fecal transplantation in obese individuals (Arnoriaga-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2020). Similarly, changes in the microbiome in this study affect cognitive function, suggesting a link between\nhttps://www.e-jer.org 169https://doi.org/10.12965/jer.2244272.136\nthe gut and the brain. In other words, the gut environment is presumed to be a factor influencing brain function. The results of this study showed that exercise is the most effective way to reduce obesity, improve memory, and suppress inflammation. Intestinal microbiota transplantation was the second most effective after exercise. Microbiota transplantation in young mice has contributed to obesity suppression and may act as an indirect method of obesity reduction. However, there was no significant difference in the fecal microbiome transplant group according to whether or not exercise was performed."
