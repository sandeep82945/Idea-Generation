 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading the paper on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO):

1. Compare anticoagulation strategies (heparin vs bivalirudin) for patients on prolonged VV ECMO to determine optimal agent and dosing to minimize complications.

2. Investigate the role of ECMO specialist training and experience on patient outcomes. Conduct a multi-center study analyzing specialist staffing models and patient mortality/complication rates.

3. Evaluate the impact of ambulatory/awake ECMO protocols on transplant rates and post-transplant outcomes for bridge-to-transplant patients.

4. Develop and validate a risk prediction model to optimize patient selection for VV ECMO using machine learning on large datasets. Incorporate novel biomarkers.

5. Conduct a randomized trial comparing standard protective ventilation to ultra-lung protective ventilation (tidal volume <4ml/kg) in patients supported with VV ECMO for ARDS. Assess impact on duration of ECMO and patient outcomes.
