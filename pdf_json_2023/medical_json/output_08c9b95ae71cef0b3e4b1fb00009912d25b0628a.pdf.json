    "abstractText": "IMPORTANCE Studies suggest that academic medical centers (AMCs) have better outcomes than nonteaching hospitals. However, whether AMCs have spillover benefits for patients treated at neighboring community hospitals is unknown. OBJECTIVE To examine whether market-level AMC presence is associated with outcomes for patients treated at nonteaching hospitals within the same markets. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective, population-based cohort study assessed traditional Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older discharged from US acute care hospitals between 2015 and 2017 (100% sample). Data were analyzed from August 2021 to December 2022. EXPOSURES The primary exposure was market-level AMC presence. Health care markets (ie, hospital referral regions) were categorized by AMC presence (percentage of hospitalizations at AMCs) as follows: no presence (0%), low presence (>0% to 20%), moderate presence (>20% to 35%), and high presence (>35%). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were 30-day and 90-day mortality and healthy days at home (HDAH), a composite outcome reflecting mortality and time spent in facilitybased health care settings. RESULTS There were 22 509 824 total hospitalizations, with 18 865 229 (83.8%) at non-AMCs. The median (IQR) age of patients was 78 (71-85) years, and 12 568 230 hospitalizations (55.8%) were among women. Of 306 hospital referral regions, 191 (62.4%) had no AMCs, 61 (19.9%) had 1 AMC, and 55 (17.6%) had 2 or more AMCs. Markets characteristics differed significantly by category of AMC presence, including mean population, median income, proportion of White residents, and physicians per population. Compared with markets with no AMC presence, receiving care at a non-AMC in a market with greater AMC presence was associated with lower 30-day mortality (9.5% vs 10.1%; absolute difference, \u22120.7%; 95% CI, \u22121.0% to \u22120.4%; P < .001) and 90-day mortality (16.1% vs 16.9%; absolute difference, \u22120.8%; 95% CI, \u22121.2% to \u22120.4%; P < .001) and more HDAH at 30 days (16.49 vs 16.12 HDAH; absolute difference, 0.38 HDAH; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.64 HDAH; P = .005) and 90 days (61.08 vs 59.83 HDAH; absolute difference, 1.25 HDAH; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.92 HDAH; P < .001), after adjustment. There was no association between market-level AMC presence and mortality for patients treated at AMCs themselves. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE AMCs may have spillover effects on outcomes for patients treated at non-AMCs, suggesting that they have a broader impact than is traditionally recognized. These associations are greatest in markets with the highest AMC presence and persist to 90 days. JAMA Network Open. 2023;6(2):e2254559. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.54559 Key Points Question Is the presence of an academic medical center (AMC) within a health care market associated with better outcomes for patients treated at neighboring nonteaching hospitals? Findings In this retrospective cohort study of 22 509 824 hospitalizations among older Medicare beneficiaries at US acute care hospitals from 2015 to 2017, receiving care in a market with high AMC presence was associated with lower mortality and a greater number of healthy days at home among patients treated at non-AMCs. Meaning These findings suggest that AMCs may have spillover effects on outcomes for patients treated at neighboring nonteaching hospitals. + Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.

However, whether AMCs have spillover benefits for patients treated at neighboring community hospitals is unknown.\nOBJECTIVE To examine whether market-level AMC presence is associated with outcomes for patients treated at nonteaching hospitals within the same markets.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective, population-based cohort study assessed traditional Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older discharged from US acute care hospitals between 2015 and 2017 (100% sample). Data were analyzed from August 2021 to December 2022.\nEXPOSURES The primary exposure was market-level AMC presence. Health care markets (ie, hospital referral regions) were categorized by AMC presence (percentage of hospitalizations at AMCs) as follows: no presence (0%), low presence (>0% to 20%), moderate presence (>20% to 35%), and high presence (>35%).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were 30-day and 90-day mortality and healthy days at home (HDAH), a composite outcome reflecting mortality and time spent in facilitybased health care settings.\nRESULTS There were 22 509 824 total hospitalizations, with 18 865 229 (83.8%) at non-AMCs. The median (IQR) age of patients was 78 (71-85) years, and 12 568 230 hospitalizations (55.8%) were among women. Of 306 hospital referral regions, 191 (62.4%) had no AMCs, 61 (19.9%) had 1 AMC, and 55 (17.6%) had 2 or more AMCs. Markets characteristics differed significantly by category of AMC presence, including mean population, median income, proportion of White residents, and physicians per population. Compared with markets with no AMC presence, receiving care at a non-AMC in a market with greater AMC presence was associated with lower 30-day mortality (9.5% vs 10.1%; absolute difference, \u22120.7%; 95% CI, \u22121.0% to \u22120.4%; P < .001) and 90-day mortality (16.1% vs 16.9%; absolute difference, \u22120.8%; 95% CI, \u22121.2% to \u22120.4%; P < .001) and more HDAH at 30 days (16.49 vs 16.12 HDAH; absolute difference, 0.38 HDAH; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.64 HDAH; P = .005) and 90 days (61.08 vs 59.83 HDAH; absolute difference, 1.25 HDAH; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.92 HDAH; P < .001), after adjustment. There was no association between market-level AMC presence and mortality for patients treated at AMCs themselves.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE AMCs may have spillover effects on outcomes for patients treated at non-AMCs, suggesting that they have a broader impact than is traditionally recognized. These associations are greatest in markets with the highest AMC presence and persist to 90 days.\nJAMA Network Open. 2023;6(2):e2254559. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.54559\nKey Points Question Is the presence of an academic medical center (AMC) within a health care market associated with better outcomes for patients treated at neighboring nonteaching hospitals?\nFindings In this retrospective cohort study of 22 509 824 hospitalizations among older Medicare beneficiaries at US acute care hospitals from 2015 to 2017, receiving care in a market with high AMC presence was associated with lower mortality and a greater number of healthy days at home among patients treated at non-AMCs.\nMeaning These findings suggest that AMCs may have spillover effects on outcomes for patients treated at neighboring nonteaching hospitals.\n+ Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.\nOpen Access.

            "text": "Variation in quality among clinicians and hospitals in the US is well documented, with meaningful differences in serious outcomes such as mortality.1,2 Such differences in health care quality result from multiple factors, including characteristics of clinicians (eg, age, gender, and patient volume),3-7 hospitals (eg, volume and complexity),8-10 and the health care market and community.11,12 One factor that has been identified as being associated with overall quality is hospital teaching status. Multiple studies13-21 have demonstrated better outcomes, on average, for patients treated at academic medical centers (AMCs) compared with those treated at nonteaching hospitals.\nHowever, given that AMCs account for a minority of US hospitals (approximately 6%),17 it is not feasible for most patients to receive treatment at an AMC. However, it is possible that AMCs provide local benefits beyond direct patient care. Formal and informal arrangements between AMCs and community hospitals may include sharing clinical staff, disseminating protocols, and serving as a source of newly trained physicians. In addition, patients in communities with greater AMC presence may have better access to clinical trials or other advances. Yet, evidence on possible spillover benefits of AMCs is lacking. A fuller understanding of the broader impact of AMCs is especially important given the substantial federal spending on graduate medical education.22,23\nWe sought to address this evidence gap using national Medicare claims to investigate the following questions: First, how does AMC presence vary among health care markets in the US? Second, do patients hospitalized at non-AMCs have lower mortality when a health care market has greater AMC presence? Third, do patients hospitalized at non-AMCs have a greater number of healthy days at home (HDAH), a population-based outcome measure that combines mortality and total time spent out of facility-based health care settings, when hospitalized in a market with greater AMC presence?"

            "text": "Data were analyzed from August 2021 to December 2022. For each HRR, we calculated the number of AMCs in 2015, as well as the proportion of hospitalizations managed at AMCs in 2015 to 2017. We created the 4 market categories: no AMC presence (0% of hospitalizations managed at AMCs), low (>0% to 20%), moderate (>20% to 35%),and high (>35%) AMC presence.\nOne concern about comparing these groups is that they have demographic and health system differences beyond AMC presence that are associated with differential health outcomes. We, therefore, examined how key characteristics varied among the 4 market groups and tested for differences using analysis of variance for means and Kruskal-Wallis for medians.\nAfter calculating raw mortality rates, we constructed a set of linear probability models with 30-day mortality as the outcome and market-level AMC presence as the categorical variable. Our initial model adjusted for year, principal discharge diagnosis, geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), and hospital random effects. Given that patient characteristics vary widely and are associated with patient outcomes,30,31 our subsequent model further incorporated the diagnosisrelated group weight as an indicator of the complexity of the acute condition as well as patient demographics (age, sex, and Medicaid eligibility) and chronic conditions. To account for nonrandom distribution of AMCs and hypothesized differences in the types of communities where AMCs are located, our main model further incorporated market characteristics (total population, proportion of Black residents, median income, physicians per 100 000 population, and hospital FTEs per 1000 population). We calculated mean adjusted rates of 30-day mortality for the 4 market groups and repeated these models for the outcome of 90-day mortality. We specified analogous sets of linear regression models with the outcomes of 30-day and 90-day HDAH. SAS code for the main models is presented in eTable 1 in Supplement 1.\nIn secondary analyses, to evaluate the association for a nonlinear trend, we created a locally estimated scatterplot smoothing curve, plotting the proportion of hospitalizations in an HRR managed at an AMC on the x-axis and unadjusted 30-day mortality on the y-axis. We repeated our analysis for adjusted 30-day mortality using market AMC presence as a continuous variable, adjusting for patient and market characteristics.\nWe considered the possibility that any association between market-level AMC presence and patient outcomes at non-AMCs could be associated with unobserved between-market differences in patient severity, rather than spillover effects of AMCs. If that were the case, we might expect to see similar patterns of outcomes for patients treated at AMCs themselves within these same market categories. Thus, we repeated our models for mortality among patients hospitalized at AMCs, with AMC presence as the categorical variable and adjusting for the same set of covariates.\nOne potential mechanism for the association between AMC presence and mortality for patients at non-AMCs could be the differential ability to transfer seriously ill patients. Timely transfer is\nJAMA Network Open. 2023;6(2):e2254559. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.54559 (Reprinted) February 1, 2023 3/12\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/13/2024\nassociated with better outcomes for key conditions.32 It is, thus, possible that equivalently ill patients in markets with low AMC presence may have worse outcomes if they lack access to tertiary care transfer. We, therefore, repeated our models for 30-day and 90-day mortality, incorporating marketlevel transfer rate. We conducted analyses using SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute), using a significance level of P < .05 and calculating 2-sided 95% CIs."

            "text": "To address the concern that patients with less-severe conditions reside in markets with high AMC presence and, therefore, have lower mortality, we checked for analogous differences in mortality among patients seen at AMCs (eFigure 7 in Supplement 1). There was no significant association between market-level AMC presence and outcomes for patients treated at AMCs in any of the mortality models (eTable 4 in Supplement 1), suggesting that patients are equally healthy in markets with high and low AMC presence.\nWhen examining AMC presence as a continuous variable, the locally estimated scatterplot smoothing curve revealed a small decline in 30-day mortality with increasing AMC presence (eFigure 8 in Supplement 1), consistent with our primary finding. After adjusting for patient and market characteristics, each 1% increase in market-level AMC presence was associated with \u22120.20% difference in 30-day mortality for patients hospitalized at non-AMCs (95% CI, \u22120.23% to \u22120.07%; P < .001).\nAs noted in Table 1, the percentage of hospitalizations at non-AMCs ending in transfer was 2.1% in markets with no and low AMC presence, 2.9% in markets with moderate AMC presence, and 3.1% in markets with high AMC presence. After incorporating HRR-level transfer rates as a covariate, the association between hospitalization in a market with high AMC presence and lower 30-day mortality persisted but was lesser in magnitude (9.7% vs 10.1%; absolute difference, \u22120.4%; 95% CI, \u22120.7% to \u22120.1%; P = .005) (eTable 3 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 1) compared with the model only accounting for patient and market characteristics.

            "text": "In a national cohort study of more than 22 million hospitalizations among traditional Medicare beneficiaries from 2015 to 2017, patients hospitalized at non-AMCs had lower 30-day and 90-day mortality and more HDAH at 30 and 90 days when they received care in markets with greater AMC presence. Adjusting for patient characteristics increased this association relative to the unadjusted model, which persisted even when accounting for other demographic and health system factors that differed among the market groups. In contrast, we found no association between market-level AMC presence and outcomes for patients treated at AMCs themselves. Taken together, these results suggest a spillover effect of AMCs on outcomes for neighboring community hospitals and that the benefit of AMCs for the broader community may be greater than is traditionally recognized.\nThere are multiple potential mechanisms by which AMCs may improve outcomes for patients in community hospitals. Patients hospitalized at non-AMCs in regions with higher AMC presence were more often transferred to another short-term general hospital for ongoing care. It is possible that greater AMC availability in these markets allowed non-AMCs to transfer patients who would most benefit from advanced capabilities at tertiary centers.33 Prior research has suggested that transfer is associated with better outcomes for selected conditions32 and that the failure to transfer in a timely fashion represents a source of inequity.34,35 When we accounted for market-level differences in transfer rates, the association between high AMC presence and lower mortality for patients hospitalized at non-AMCs was smaller but remained significant. These findings suggest that variation in tertiary care transfer likely accounts for some, but not all, of the possible mortality benefit of receiving care in a market with greater AMC presence for patients hospitalized at non-AMCs.\nMarkets with the greatest AMC presence had more nurses and physicians per capita. There is evidence that physicians tend to practice in close geographic proximity to where they trained,36 with more than one-half of residency graduates historically practicing in the same state after graduation.37,38 Thus, it is possible that the presence of an AMC may lead to a more robust physician supply and better patient outcomes at community hospitals. Alternatively, it may be that a number of formal and informal affiliations between AMCs and non-AMCs within the same market leads to diffusion of knowledge, innovation, and even sharing of clinicians who work at multiple sites.39,40 For key serious conditions, such as a stroke, AMCs have been shown to promote evidence-based practice and improve patient outcomes at community hospitals.41\nThis study extends prior work examining the association of AMCs with acute care outcomes. Multiple studies13-21 have suggested that patients treated at AMCs have better outcomes across the spectrum of patient severity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically examine the potential indirect clinical benefits of receiving care at a nonteaching hospital with greater proximity to 1 or more AMCs across a wide range of conditions.\nThis study is consistent with other studies demonstrating geographic disparities in health care access,42 particularly for key specialty services.12,43 These data highlight the degree to which AMCs tend to be concentrated, with rural regions having less access to AMC services on average. Thus, identifying strategies by which AMCs may enhance care for patients in rural and other remote locations44-46 has the potential to improve health outcomes for underserved populations and widen the reach of the nation\u2019s academic health care institutions."

However, it is possible that there are residual patient and market confounders that may impact our results. To address this, we repeated our models among patients hospitalized at AMCs themselves, hypothesizing that if market factors were the key factors associated with any differential patient outcomes\u2014rather than spillover effects of AMCs within the market\u2014then we would see analogous trends for patients hospitalized at AMCs. In addition, although this study examines all hospitalizations among traditional Medicare beneficiaries, it is possible that the results may differ for other populations. Furthermore, we chose a linear probability model because the results can be interpreted as absolute differences in percentages between category of HRR-level AMC presence. Absolute differences are more interpretable than relative differences reflected in odds ratios from a logistic regression model. However, the linear probability model has technical disadvantages because the model can estimate probabilities below 0 or above 1 and does not allow for unequal variances."
