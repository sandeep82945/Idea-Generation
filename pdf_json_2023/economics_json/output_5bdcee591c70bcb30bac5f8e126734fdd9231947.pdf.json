    "abstractText": "Plasma gasification is considered an environmentally friendly process to convert plastic waste into fuel oil; a prototype system is described to test and validate the plasma treatment of plastic waste as a strategic vision. The proposed plasma treatment project will deal with a plasma reactor with a waste capacity of 200 t/day. The annual plastic waste production in tons in all regions of Makkah city during 27 years for all months in the years 1994 to 2022 is evaluated. A statistics survey of plastic waste displays the average rate generation ranging from 224 thousand tons in the year 1994 to 400 thousand tons in the year 2022, with an amount of recovered pyrolysis oil; 3.17 \u00d7 105 t with the equivalent energy; 12.55 \u00d7 109 MJ, and an amount of recovered diesel oil; 2.7 \u00d7 105 t with an amount of electricity for sale 2.96 \u00d7 106 MW.h. The economic vision will be estimated, using the results of energy generated from diesel oil as an industrial fuel extracted from plastic waste equivalent to 0.2 million barrels of diesel oil, with sales revenue and cash recovery of USD 5 million, considering the sale of each one barrel of diesel extracted from plastic waste in the range of USD 25. It is important to consider that the equivalent barrels of petroleum cost, according to the organization of the petroleum-exporting countries\u2019 basket prices, up to USD 20 million. The sales profit (2022) is as follows: for diesel with a sales revenue of diesel oil, USD 5 million, with a rate of return of 4.1%, and a payback period of 3.75 years. The generated electricity reached USD 32 million for households and USD 50 million for factories.",

Many research groups, during the past forty years, have published with Umm Al-Qura University in the following disciplines, for example: environmental and economic sustainability in the hajj, waste, toxic gases, air pollution, climate change, geophysical and topographic analyses, technological applications, digital transformation, and crowd sciences [1\u20133]. Waste is considered a major challenge in the 2030 vision of K.S.A. and plastic waste, especially, is considered the second largest municipal waste stream after scrap tires. The sustainable development of the environment through energy recovery from plastic waste as a source of fuel oil is proposed. This project is one of a series of projects dealing with waste-to-energy (WTE) technology using thermal plasma [4,5], as shown in Figure 1, in Makkah city on energy recovery from municipal waste, scrap tires\u2019 waste, grey water, medical waste, and slaughterhouses\u2019 waste as the perspective work.

pyrolysis, all of which have many benefits such as financial benefits, job creation, resource conservation, partial economic gains, partial energy saving, and partial environmental protection. On the other hand, there are many disadvantages:\n(i) Landfills establish serious risks to the environment and human health, due to the growing amounts of plastic waste, and the high atmospheric temperature in Makkah. As the amount of plastic waste at the lowest depth of the landfill increases, a decrease in the oxygen ratio, degradation, and smoke processes will be produced. In addition, toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen sulfide, and dioxins begin to be released, and over time they seep into the ground outside the landfill area [7]. (ii) Recycling has very low economic benefits due to high costs, low profits, unsanitary locations, unsustainable products, and higher energy use, as well as more pollutants [8]. (iii) Incineration, a waste-to-energy process, does not lead to complete combustion; the product is not economical, and therefore has a negative impact as many pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and fly ash are emitted after the process. In addition, the residual tar and ash represent about 30% of the original volu e, and the utilization of energy products resulting from the transformation is inflexible [9]. (iv) Pyrolysis is completely free of oxidants and is a thermoche ical conversion process th t converts raw materials into char, oil, and com ustible gases in an inert atmosphere. A pyrolysis plant does not meet environmental e ission standards a d caus s more air and soil pollution han an incineration plant [10].\nIn entrained flow gasification with the assistance of streams of hot plasma emerging from the plasma torches [11\u201313], the use of plasma has a considerable influence on the quality of gas, which has a higher heating value of gas. Entrained flow gasification is considered one of th most promising technologies for larg -scale, clean, and efficient syngas production at very high t mperatures, air oxidation, and various feedstocks. Th reaction in entrained flow gasification occurs at very high rate, with high carbon convers efficienci s. It has the advantage of adapting to different processes with various fee stocks, such as multi-burner gasification technology with coal, water slurry, non-catalytic partial oxid tion technology using natural g s r c ke oven gas, and biomass gasification in the early techn logical developmental phase. Furthermore, water vapor gasificati n technology can convert solid f els into cleaner gaseous fuels. Since the water vapor gasification reaction is highly endothermic, high temperatures are normally required to obtain the desired reaction rate. In addition, conventional steam gasifiers require that at least 35% of the feedstock be combusted with air to drive the gasification reaction, resulting in additional NOx emissions. In recent years, increasingly important energy trends for gasification processes appeared, such as microwave heating technology with high efficiency and easy control. Under the influence of the electric field of an external microwave input, carbonaceous fuels tend to produce nanometer-scale thermal effects in a short time. This method is an increasingly important energy fashion trend [14].\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2433 3 of 16\nIn addition, another new fashion trend for the gasification process is the release of mercury (Hg) into the environment and the distribution of process products. It is of great importance to determine the behavior of Hg in the thermal treatment process of waste, with the parameters\u2019 temperature, residence time, and purge gas flow rate impacting the release of Hg from the waste. Different rates of Hg release during thermal treatment depend on the type of waste. Hg is most readily released from the plastic sample, as there is significant potential to produce low-Hg alternative fuel from waste through thermal treatment [15]. The value of the Hg emission during the combustion process depends on the initial mercury content in the waste, such as coke waste, sewage sludge, coal ash, paper ash, and biomass waste ash with mercury contents of 523.16 \u00b5g/kg, 527.81 \u00b5g/kg, 6.02 \u00b5g/kg, 1.45 \u00b5g/kg, and 6.47 \u00b5g/kg, respectively. The addition of a polymer up to 10% leads to a reduction in mercury emissions of 53.72% for coal fuels and a reduction of 26.36% in the case of coal sludge [16]. As is known, the four states of matter are solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. Plasma can exist in various configurations and can be produced as thermal and non-thermal plasma in technological applications. During the past twenty years, more than 50 articles have been published with Umm Al-Qura University in these disciplines, for example: for cold plasma (non-thermal plasma), the articles [17,18] dealt with sterilization, inactivation of microbes, increasing the performance quality of surgical gown samples, and increasing the antimicrobial performance and the quality of the mechanical properties of Ihram cotton fabric. For hot plasma (thermal plasma) [19,20], our previously proposed phases of the plasma treatment (PTP) projects were as follows: (i) Sustainable development solutions using the plasma treatment project for the medical waste problem to obtain gross profits from the sale of energy products such as syngas, pyrolysis oil, and diesel oil; (ii) Plasma Treatment Project for Municipal Solid Waste to energy (PTPMSW) from the waste source or from a landfill for their sustainable energy, chemical valorization, and the product gas efficiency from waste to gas, and the electrical power generation system was estimated at 5000 kW; (iii) Scrap Tire Plasma Treatment Project (PTPST) to produce synthetic fuels and syngas and hydrocarbons, biofuels, and soot where the main products were 40% slag, 8% synthetic syngas, and pyrolysis oil (52%). After plasma treatment, the annual heat energy produced from scrap tires per ton is 15.5 TJ. The enormous amount of all kinds and forms of plastic waste requires the rapid development of waste treatment methods on a large scale for an increasingly focused energy recovery (WTE). The use of non-conventional modern methods such as the treatment of plastic waste using plasma reactors differs from the traditional slow methods such as burying, recycling, dumping, or incinerating waste, leading to health and environmental problems and the loss of large amounts of organic matter, which represents 80% of the value of waste [21,22]. The restrictions imposed on traditional techniques and the increasingly strict legislation in the Kingdom regarding waste disposal make plasma technologies the driving force for sustainable development and contribute to the main priority, which is environmental quality. Plasma waste treatment technology is more attractive than other technologies such as recycling, incineration, and gasification because of its environmental benefits and reasonable costs [23\u201325]. The plasma waste treatment technology is content to generate electricity or heat (thermal conversion) and to produce or recover a valuable by-product from the syngas, such as methanol or hydrogen for fuel. The plasma gasification process regarding energy recovery, environmental costs, expected profits, and employment opportunities is analyzed. Either energy efficiency or environmental safety are available in plasma technology as it can handle any chemical composition of waste due to its high temperatures [26,27]. The inorganic components of raw materials are converted into unfiltered lava using a thermal plasma process, while the organic components are gasified and transformed into industrial gases with high calorific values and high material yields. The feedstock is processed to maximize the quality of the synthetic gas using the parameters established by the end user. These conditions (chemical conversion) can be met by syngas which have\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2433 4 of 16\nthe highest energy cells. In many facets of everyday life, petroleum is a vital resource for industrial use and massive buildings. When synthetic fuel is generated from plastic treated in a plasma reactor, it costs less than the energy extracted as fuel from petroleum, which is shown as a gross profit [28]. The novelty in the current article, shown clearly in the energy recovery evaluation using plasma reactors, is an economic evaluation model for counting that will be estimated including the cost of the raw material and reactor, revenue expenses, income cash flow, profit, and payback flow for industrial fuel (EEIF) from plastic waste for sustainable development."

as follows: (i) Pre-treatment of plastic waste for rapid processing (such as grinding, chopping, or shredding) before feeding it to the plasma reactor. (ii) Conversion process of plastic waste into three products, i.e., syngas, pyrolysis oil, and slag takes place in a combustion-like chamber at high temperatures of up to 1500\u20135000 \u25e6C. The active working gas is air, which has an important effect on the oxidation in the plasma treatment reactor without the production of environmental pollutants from the produced gasses. (iii) Industrial fuel (pyrolysis oil) is collected, intensified, and purified; the synthetic gas is cleaned; and the end product is the slag, which is periodically or continuously drained at the bottom of the reactor [30,31]. (iv) In the fourth stage, liquid fuels (pyrolysis oil) can be used as an energy product to generate electricity or fuel for consumption in factories such as cement plants [32]. The experimental plastic treatment for energy recovery using a plasma gasification reactor is based on the thermal plasma jet coming out of the air plasma torch with an electrical power of 125 kW, an airflow rate of 10\u201330 mg/s, and temperatures up to between 1500 and 5000 \u25e6C. There are two reactor water cooling systems: the first is designed to operate at a wall temperature of up to 1500 \u25e6C, and the second is designed to operate with\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2433 5 of 16\nthe exiting hot syngas produced and flowing from the furnace reactor through a cylindrical quench chamber. Furthermore, at the exit of the quenching chamber, the gas has a low temperature and enters a condensation chamber. The air plasma torch is the main component of the plasma reactor, with the parameters given in Table 1. Figure 3 shows the schematic diagram of the air plasma torch (nontransferred arc) powered by a direct current as discussed briefly before in our previous article [33]. The electrical energy is transformed into thermal energy in the plasma torch, where the thermal plasma jet emerges from the torch due to the pressure of the compressed air flow, where there is a fast rate of heat transfer from the plasma torch to plastic waste and the inner walls of the reactor.\nTable 1.

According to the statistical calculation of the amount of electricity by MW.h., the estimated energy recovery, and the generated electricity, all of these energies can be extracted from plastic waste annually as a renewable and cheaper fuel energy instead of petroleum oil. A parametric energy recovery analysis of plastic waste streams is performed to assess the output energy represented by (i) pyrolysis oil (tons per year), represented by 0.8 of the input plastic waste, where the typical fuel oil production from pyrolysis (1 kg mixed plastic (type PE, PP, and PS)) is equal to 0.8 kg oil; (ii) the equivalent energy (Megajoule) of the pyrolysis oil equal to 39.6 MJ/kg (Appendix B); (iii) diesel oil (tons per year) represented by 0.85 from the input pyrolysis oil after distillation processes; (iv) the amount of electricity generated (MW.h from the amount of diesel oil), taking into account that 1 MW.h is equal to 3600 MJ. Table 2 shows the output energy of plastic waste from the pyrolysis oil resulting from the plasma gasification process, which will be achieved as the first energy recovery source of a plasma treatment plant. Furthermore, Table 3 shows the output electricity of the diesel oil after the distillation process due to the plasma gasification process, which will be the second energy recovery source [41\u201343], through the Arabic years from 1414 (1994) to 1440 (2022) (Appendix A).\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2433 9 of 16"

Economical Sale Revenues (ESR)\nESR are represented by syngas, diesel oil, generated electricity, coal, and slag. Considering syngas, coal, and slag are the lowest gross profits as shown in our previous articles [Galaly 21, 29, and 33], and our fashion target in the current article is diesel oil and electricity due to their high values, the sales revenues are as follows:\n(a) The Sales Revenues of Diesel Oil (SRD)\nTable 4 shows the sales revenues analysis of the extracted diesel oil according to the EEIF model annually within 2022, where the average weight of plastic per year is 400 \u00d7 103 t, with diesel oil after the distillation process from the pyrolysis oil reaching 0.2 million barrels of diesel oil extracted from plastic waste (BODPW), with the sales revenue of the diesel oil (SRD) as USD 5 million, with ROR as 4.1%, and PBP as 3.75 years, considering the expenses for the five reactors are USD 120 million.\n(b) The Sales Revenues of Electricity\nTable 5 shows the electricity generation of diesel after the pyrolysis oil distillation process annually within 2022 as follows: (i) diesel reaches 2.7 \u00d7 105 t, (ii) the extracted sales amount of electricity reaches 2.96 \u00d7 106 MW.h, (iii) the estimated sales profit for generated electricity is up to USD 32 million for households and USD 50 million for factories [58,59] from the five plasma reactors, (iv) the ROR is 26.6% for home (Arafa region), and 41.6% for factories, and (v) the PBP is 2.03 years for home (Arafa), and 1.55 years for factories.\n3.5.2. Environmental Cost-Saving Revenue\nThe environmental cost-saving revenue (ECSR) can be divided into the following:\n(a) Plastic Pollution Emission Cost\nUsing the air pollution real-time air quality parameters of the Saudi Arabia index and SimaPro program [60\u201362], the results show that the average rate of polluted landfill gas generation reaches 297 thousand megagrams of pollution in 2022 with a cost of USD 7 million annually. This is due to pollution from plastic waste due to the emission of the toxicity of environmental pollutants\u2019 gases arising from plastic waste accumulated in a landfill such as carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphor, and sulfur which pose a significant threat to human health. Pollution costs, the volume of toxic air pollution, and climate change are decreased to zero emission due to the treatment of plastic waste by the plasma reactor.\n(b) Cost-Saving Revenue of Petroleum\nThe cost-saving revenue of petroleum cashback according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) basket price has been explored [63\u201365]. There is\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2433 12 of 16\na cashback due to the conversion process of PWTE as shown in Table 6. Furthermore, according to the OPEC basket price, the cost-saving revenue of 0.2 million of equivalent barrels of petroleum is USD 20 million (see Appendix B)."

            "text": "Based on the obtained results and our previous experiences, it is recommended that the energy recovery for the sustainable development of Makkah city uses WTE technology from plastic waste, which represents our fourth vision related to remapping the waste vision after treatment: solid waste, scrap tires, and medical waste, using thermal plasma reactors as an environmentally friendly solution and renewable energy process to limit global warming without external emissions that are harmful to the environment. Using the plasma treatment reactors with a waste capacity of 1000 t/day includes the following: the average weight statistics of plastic per year in tons; pyrolysis oil extracted in tons, with equivalent energy by MJ; the amount of extracted diesel oil in tons; the number of pyrolysis oil gallons; and the statistical calculation of the amount of electricity sales by MW.h. Furthermore, the PWTE process satisfies the economic evaluations and environmental sanitation phenomena, through cashback, profits, income for industrial fuel, electricity, and environmental cost-saving revenues. In this paper, the use of thermal plasma is presented as the greenest methodology among plastic management treatments, more than treatments involving the landfill or incineration, thus contextualizing the process in a global waste management system as a non-conventional and renewable energy process. This project consists of five stages: the current article is the first; the economic vision for PWTE using the plasma reactor is the second; the landfill toxics emission analysis of plastic waste for the environmental vision is the third; the economic evaluation from carbon and slug amounts using PWTE technology and calculating the CO2 emitted by the oxidation of the plastic is the fourth; the PWTE technology as a strategic vision is the fifth. The perspective will be to use the same experimental set-up to test and validate the conversion process of slaughterhouses\u2019 waste into usable energy products.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.R.G.; methodology, A.R.G.; software, A.R.G.; validation, A.R.G.; formal analysis, A.R.G.; investigation, A.R.G.; resources, A.R.G.; data curation, A.R.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.R.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.R.G. and N.D.; visualization, A.R.G. and N.D.; supervision, A.R.G. and N.D.; project administration, A.R.G. and N.D.; funding acquisition, A.R.G. and N.D.
