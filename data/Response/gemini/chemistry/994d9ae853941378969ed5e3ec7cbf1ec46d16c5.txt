1. **Investigate the effect of different pH values on the stability and solubility of human insulin polymorphs.** This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic light scattering, and X-ray powder diffraction.
2. **Determine the crystal structures of the different human insulin polymorphs at higher resolution.** This would provide more detailed information about the molecular packing and interactions within the crystals.
3. **Study the conformational changes that occur in human insulin upon binding to its receptor.** This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations.
4. **Develop new methods for controlling the crystallization of human insulin.** This could lead to the development of new insulin formulations with improved stability, solubility, and efficacy.
5. **Investigate the potential use of human insulin polymorphs in the treatment of diabetes.** This could involve studying the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of these polymorphs in animal models and clinical trials.
