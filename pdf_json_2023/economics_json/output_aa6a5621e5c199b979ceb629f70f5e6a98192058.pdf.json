    "abstractText": "Background: Tobacco is a major cause of preventable morbidity and mortality, with a considerable economic burden. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence on the economic burden of tobacco use by searching national and international databases so as to generate useful information about the costs of tobacco use globally. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Web of Science (ISI) databases to identify relevant studies from 1990 to June 2021 using keywords like burden, productivity, indirect cost, direct cost, economic, monetary, expenditure, tobacco, smoking, and cigarettes. Cost estimates were converted into 2020 international dollars per adult. Findings: A total of 1,781 articles were identified, of which 361 were deemed to be eligible for inclusion. Eventually, 23 articles were found eligible. In most studies, cost estimates were provided using a prevalence-based approach. The highest total cost, as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), was reported for South Korea (1.19%). Noteworthy, in all studies, indirect costs accounted for the highest proportion of all costs. The mean total cost amounted to 5,866 million dollars. The direct costs ranged from 179 million dollars in South Korea to 8,156 million dollars in Israel. Meanwhile, the indirect costs ranged from 289 million dollars in Hong Kong to 9,808 million dollars in India. Conclusion: The evidence demonstrated the considerable economic burden of tobacco use in various countries, ranging from 0.33 to 1.19% of the GDP of the investigated countries, indicating the necessity of taking immediate measures. Hence, policies are needed to address the economic burden of smoking.",

            "text": "As a leading cause of preventable mortality and morbidity, tobacco use claims more than eight million lives annually, based on the World Health Organization (WHO).1,2 This number is expected to increase considerably by 2030. 3 Meanwhile, smoking causes considerable premature disability and mortality. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly cancer and cardiovascular diseases, claim 41 million lives annually with 85% of these premature deaths occurring in low- and middle-income (LMICs). Noteworthy, tobacco use, lack of physical activity, excessive use of alcohol, and inappropriate diets increase the risk of NCDs.4 About 80% of deaths are attributed to NCDs, mostly due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as lung cancer.3 It is difficult and resource-consuming to manage these diseases as therapeutic interventions, which are mostly expensive, must be administered in specialized health settings.5 This indicates the necessity of using effective tools to reduce the demand for tobacco use.\nMoreover, smoking-related diseases lead to a\nconsiderable economic burden, as evidenced by several studies.6,7 There are estimates indicating an annual economic loss of US$ 500 billion worldwide, including productivity loss, morbidity, and premature deaths,8 accounting for 1-4% of GDP in high-income countries (HICs) (e.g., 2.1\u20133.4% of GDP in Australia, 1.3\u20132.2% in Canada, and 1.4\u20131.6% of GDP in the United States).9 Nevertheless, the topic seems to be flown under the radar of researchers in HICs.\nGlobally, tobacco use is rising, with higher prevalence among lower socioeconomic groups, and Iran is no exception.10 The health system of Iran has three tiers, with major contribution of private players and a poorly equipped public sector, which along with considerably high out-of-pocket expenditures, yields health inequalities.11 Hence, it can be argued that the overall burden of tobacco use, either mortality or morbidity, is disproportionately higher among the disadvantaged groups, leading to higher public health expenditures and exacerbating health inequalities.12\nTraditionally, policymakers tried to promote tobacco\n*Corresponding Author: Mehdi Jafari, Email: mjafari@iums.ac.ir\nReceived: May 22, 2022, Accepted: August 15, 2022, ePublished: April 29, 2023\nCitation: Bakhtiari Aliabad M, Masoudi-Asl I, Abolhallaje M, Jafari M.

However, in comparison to HICs, there is relatively little evidence in LMICs driven by lower per capita health expenditures and higher unemployment rates. The economic burden is often divided into direct and indirect components. The former refers to the total cost directly imposed on individuals, families, and society. The latter refers to the loss of the present and future value of society and family.14 In this regard, the purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence on the economic burden of tobacco use by searching national and international databases so as to generate useful information about the costs of tobacco use globally."

Google Scholar was also searched to enhance the chance of finding potentially relevant articles. Moreover, reference lists of the identified articles were hand-searched.\nThe search strategy used for various databases is described in Table 1.\nTitle and abstract screening was performed by one\nof the researchers, followed by full-text screening by two researchers. Disagreements were resolved through consensus or consulting a third reviewer. The search strategy was repeated by a second independent reviewer to ensure the adequacy of the search process. After searching the aforementioned databases, all identified studies were transferred to Endnote X7, and duplicates were removed."

If costs were in US dollar, they were converted into the 2020 US Dollar; afterward, turned into the 2020 US Dollar based on the currency exchange rate in that period.

All sections of the articles, including title, abstract, objective(s), problem statement, study type, sampling, participants, variables, data collection, statistical analysis, findings, and discussion were reviewed to evaluate the overall quality. Each of the aforementioned topics was scored one or zero. The minimum and maximum scores of the STROBE checklist are zero and 32, respectively.

Following reviewing titles and abstracts, 361 articles were deemed to be eligible for inclusion in this review (Figure 1). Besides, three articles were identified through a search of reference lists. Eventually, 23 studies were found eligible. Table 2 presents a summary of the key information of the reviewed articles.\nFrom among the 23 eligible studies providing estimates of smoking-related costs, either direct or indirect, 15 were conducted in Asian countries, one in Africa, four in Europe, and three in North America. Respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and lung and larynx cancers were the most commonly investigated diseases. Two studies investigated all diseases.33,36 In addition, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung and larynx cancers were considered by most studies. Except for two studies, the rest reported both indirect and direct costs. Furthermore, 16 studies estimated the total cost as a percentage of GDP. Most studies used prevalence to estimate the costs.7,18,19,28-30,36,38 The highest and lowest rates of the total cost as a percentage of GDP were reported for South Korea; 1.19%17 and 0.33%,27 respectively. Noteworthy, for all studies, indirect costs accounted for the highest share of all costs, except for one study conducted in Canada.31\nAddict Health.

            "text": "There are more than one billion smokers in the world, 80% of whom live in LMICs.39 Nearly 25% of world smokers are 13 to 15 years old. Nowadays, inclination towards tobacco use is on the rise worldwide due to several reasons such as stress, high costs of living, etc. In Iran, the skyrocketing inflation rate, in combination with some other significant factors such as restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, can be considered a major predictor of increasing tobacco use. Currently, societies are facing two major problems: the high and increasing number of tobacco users and the high social, economic, and health burden of tobacco use. Tobacco use related costs are high in various societies, not to mention high rates of morbidity and mortality.40,41 In fact, tobacco use is a major factor of mortality globally.34 On the other hand, the total economic costs associated with smoking are estimated to account for 1.5% of the global GDP.39\nThe present systematic review aimed to provide a detailed summary of the economic costs of smoking worldwide. In this regard, a total of 23 articles were reviewed to assess smoking-related diseases. The findings indicated the considerable burden of smokingrelated costs, ranging from 0.33 to 1.19% of the GDP in the investigated countries. Noteworthy, indirect costs contributed to the highest proportion of the total costs of tobacco use, except for one study in Canada. The identified studies were homogeneous in many respects, including investigated disease conditions, cost categories, sources of costs, and methodological approaches.\nWhile tobacco use contributes to the occurrence of a wide spectrum of diseases, several studies only focused on a limited number of diseases (e.g., cancers and respiratory diseases), which probably affects the results. For instance, the evidence supported the major effect of tobacco on perinatal outcomes, leading to substantial health-related costs, but few studies investigated this.42 Although this review did not intend to compare costs related to various diseases and states, a wider range of diseases was expected to have been studied. Nevertheless, this limitation may reflect the unavailability of information required across countries. Another important finding was the lack of a standard list of diseases and conditions caused by tobacco, which resulted in the investigation of different diseases in various studies. In some cases, this limitation faded comparability of the findings, even in countries located in a similar region.43,44 Despite this shortcoming, the findings indicated the considerable economic burden of tobacco, either direct or indirect.Au th or s C ou nt ry Y ea r of re po rt ed c os ts To ta l c os t (U S m ill io n $) D ir ec\nt C\nos ts\nIn\ndi re\nct\nC os\nt TC\na s\n%\nof G\nD P\nD is\nea se\ns in\ncl ud\ned M\net ho\ndo lo\ngy\nTh e\nre se\nar ch\nte am\nas\nsi gn\ned b\ny th\ne m\nin is\ntr y\nof h\nea lth\n(2 01\n2) 31\nC an\nad a\n20 11\n17 1.\n5 16\n.2 9.\n5 N\nA\nTh e\nst ud\ny fo\ncu se\nd on\nm or\nta lit\ny, m\nor bi\ndi ty\n, a nd\nd ir\nec t h\nea lth\nca re\nco\nst s\nof c\nig ar\net te\ns m\nok in\ng an\nd di\nd no\nt i nc\nlu de\nth e\nco ns\num pt\nio n\nof\nci ga\nrs , s\nm ok\nel es\ns to\nba cc\no, p\nip e\nto ba\ncc o,\no r\not he\nr fo\nrm s\nof to\nba cc o co ns um pt io n\nA p\nre va\nle nc\neba\nse d,\nd is\nea se\n-s pe\nci fic\n, c os\ntof - ill ne ss a pp ro ac h\nU SA\nC D\nC (2\n01 2)\n32 U\nSA 20\n15 22\n.5 15\n.6 38\n.1 A\nll di\nse as\nes Th\ne co\nst -o\nfill\nne ss\nes a\npp ro\nac h\nN ar\ngi s\net a\nl ( 20\n17 )3\n3 U\nga nd\na 20\n14 12\n6. 57\n41 .5\n6 85\n.0 1\n0. 5%\nA ll\ndi se\nas es\nTh e\nco st\n-o f-\nill ne\nss es\na pp\nro ac\nh\nA m\nar as\nin gh\ne et\na l\n(2 01\n8) 7\nSr i La nk\na 20\n15 12\n1. 2\n42 .1\n79 .1\nTo ba\ncc o-\nre la\nte d\nca nc\ner s\nPr ev\nal en\nce -b\nas ed\nc os\ntof\n-i lln\nes s\nap pr\noa ch\nJo hn\ne t a\nl ( 20\n19 )3\n4 In\ndi a\n20 17\n12 .4\nb ill\nio n\n20 .9\n% 79\n.1 %\n0. 5%\nA ll\ndi se\nas es\na nd\nd ea\nth s\nin In\ndi a\nin 2\n01 7\nfo r\npe rs\non s\nag ed\n3 0\u2013\n69\nye ar\ns A\np re\nva le\nnc e-\nba se\nd at\ntr ib\nut ab\nle -r\nis k\nap pr\noa ch\nK or\non ai\nou e\nt a l3\n5 G\nre ec\ne 20\n17 7.\n2 bi\nlli on\n4% To\nta l e\nco no\nm ic\nc os\nt o f t\nob ac\nco s\nm ok\nin g\nan d\nse co\nnd ha\nnd s\nm ok e (S H S) e xp os ur e A\nc os\ntof\n-i lln\nes s\nap pr\noa ch\nK om\non pa\nis ar\nn (2\n02 1)\n36 Th\nai la\nnd 20\n17 28\n9. 63\n26 5.\n97 23\n.6 6\n0. 65\n% A\nll di\nse as\nes A\np re\nva le\nnc e-\nba se\nd co\nst -o\nfill\nne ss\na pp\nro ac\nh\nJo hn\ne t a\nl ( 20\n21 ) 3\n7 In\ndi a\n20 17\n27 .5\nb ill\nio n\n6 bi\nlli on\n21 .5\nbi\nlli on\n1. 04\n% A\nll di\nse as\nes A\np re\nva le\nnc e-\nba se\nd at\ntr ib\nut ab\nle -r\nis k\nap pr\noa ch\nA bb\nre vi\nat io\nns : N\nA , s\nta nd\ns no\nt a va\nila bl\ne; T\nC , t\not al\nc os\nt; IH\nD , i\nsc he\nm ic\nh ea\nrt d\nis ea\nse ; P\nA R\n, p op\nul at\nio n\nat tr\nib ut\nab le\nr is\nk; C\nO PD\n, c hr\non ic\no bs\ntr uc\ntiv e\npu lm\non ar\ny di\nse as\ne; T\nB , t\nub er\ncu lo\nsi s.\nTa bl\ne 2.\nC on\ntin ue\nd\nAddict Health. Volume 15, Number 2, 2023 133\nAnother important finding was the large variation concerning reported costs. Meanwhile, there was a methodological homogeneity, with prevalence-based approach as the most commonly used method (n = 9). The methodologies ranged from epidemiological, health impact, and survival impact to cost-of-illness approaches. Prevalence-based approaches consider both existing and new cases for determining economic costs attributable to a particular condition.45 Despite their extensive difference, evidence produced by these approaches can stimulate policy-makers to take immediate measures to curb the tobacco epidemic.46 Noteworthy, all of them were complementary, not contradictory. In addition, choosing the appropriate method depends on several factors, including study context, available data, study question, and so on. When evaluating the effectiveness of a policy or an intervention, incidence-based approaches can provide valuable evidence. On the other hand, prevalence-based approaches are appropriate for budgeting purposes. Surprisingly, only two studies used the WHO methodology to calculate the costs associated with tobacco use.7,33 This method is based on using the cost-of-illness approach.47 The literature supported the following measures to improve the validity of studies intended to estimate tobacco-related costs: (a) using a standard set of conditions/diseases; (b) following a general, standard method (i.e., WHO guidelines); and (c) the standard inclusion of cost areas (i.e., tangible, intangible, etc).42\nComparing costs among various countries is always problematic. Even in cases where local currency is reported using purchasing power calculator, it is unlikely to overcome considerable differences between counties concerning cost items, including health-related costs or estimation of the number of deaths. Health surveillance data are available in few countries. Nevertheless, adoption of the WHO FCTC paved the way for taking serious measures to access such data.48-50\nWhile intangible costs were not considered in most of the studies, such as those related to premature mortality, the reported costs attributable to tobacco use were substantial. Notably, a recent study in Australia reported that intangible costs accounted for nearly 85% of the total social costs of smoking.51 In addition, according to the Global Burden of Diseases, years lived with a disability account for nearly 33% of the disability-adjusted life years related to tobacco use.52 Hence, considering intangible costs can significantly improve the accuracy of estimates regarding tobacco use costs.\nThe present study had some limitations, such as not including studies in languages other than English, which probably has led to publication bias. Moreover, due to challenges in accessing grey literature, evidence provided by such studies could not be included in the present study. Thus, caution should be taken when generalizing\nthe findings."

Therefore, policies are needed to address the economic burden of smoking. In comparison to previous studies, this study provided a wider range of evidence to compare countries and make necessary decisions. For instance, separate estimates of both direct and indirect costs, as well as a percentage of the GDP were provided paving the way for a better understanding of the big picture.\nAcknowledgments The authors would like to thank Dr. Sadegh Ghazanfari for providing valuable comments.\nAuthors\u2019 Contribution Conceptualization: Mohammad Bakhtiari Ali Abad, Mehdi Jafari.
