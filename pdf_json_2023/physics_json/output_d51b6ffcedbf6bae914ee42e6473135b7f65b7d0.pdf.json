    "abstractText": "Two-dimensional black phosphorus (BP) has emerged as a perspective material for various microand opto-electronic, energy, catalytic, and biomedical applications. Chemical functionalization of black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNS) is an important pathway for the preparation of materials with improved ambient stability and enhanced physical properties. Currently, the covalent functionalization of BPNS with highly reactive intermediates, such as carbon-free radicals or nitrenes, has been widely implemented to modify the material\u2019s surface. However, it should be noted that this field requires more in-depth research and new developments. Herein, we report for the first time the covalent carbene functionalization of BPNS using dichlorocarbene as a functionalizing agent. The P\u2013C bond formation in the obtained material (BP\u2013CCl2) has been confirmed by Raman, solid-state 31P NMR, IR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy methods. The BP\u2013CCl2 nanosheets exhibit an enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with an overpotential of 442 mV at \u22121 mA cm\u22122 and a Tafel slope of 120 mV dec\u22121, outperforming the pristine BPNS.",

            "text": "In the past years, two-dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP)-based materials have received significant attention in the scientific community. Owing to their unique puckered and in-plane anisotropic structure, tunable direct bandgap, and high charge carrier mobility, black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNS) have found broad applications in various fields, such as field-effect transistors, optoelectronic and energy devices, energy conversion, biomedicine, sensors, and electro- and photo-catalysis [1\u20139]. However, the rapid degradation of BPNS in the presence of air and moisture may result in a loss of intrinsic electronic properties, which impedes the use of exfoliated BP in most practical applications [8]. In this regard, the chemical functionalization of BPNS has been proposed as an efficient method to improve the oxidation stability of the material. Moreover, besides enhanced\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 826. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13050826 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 826 2 of 14\nenvironmental stability, chemical functionalization of BPNS has become an excellent tool for fine-tuning its intrinsic physical properties, as well as impartment of new properties of the material, and has found widespread use for the construction of new BP-based functional materials [10\u201313]. Currently, covalent functionalization of BPNS using diazonium or iodonium salts or organic azides as precursors for the generation of highly reactive intermediates (carbon-free radicals or nitrenes) has been extensively explored [14\u201318]. In addition, other routes for the chemical functionalization of BPNS, including reductive alkylation and functionalization with nucleophilic agents, have also been developed [19,20]. Carbenes derived from chloroform or diazirines are widely implemented for the functionalization of various carbon materials [21\u201324]. Chloroform, upon treatment with a strong base, forms dichlorocarbene, which is able to functionalize carbon materials by the cycloaddition reaction to C=C bonds [22]. The use of diazirines as precursors for the generation of carbenes makes it possible to vary the structure of carbenes, which have been successfully used to graft the organic linkers for immobilization of metal nanoparticles and metal complexes on the surface of carbon nanotubes and graphene nanosheets [24,25]. Moreover, it was shown that the functionalization with carbene moieties might be achieved not only by the cycloaddition reactions, but also via carbene insertion reactions into C\u2013H, N\u2013H, or O\u2013H groups [24,26]. The first-principal studies provided by P. Denis have shown that carbenes and nitrenes are promising reactants to functionalize phosphorene nanosheets [27]. The study revealed that the addition of dichlorocarbene and dibromocarbene to phosphorene may proceed in two ways: via a [1 + 2] cycloaddition reaction with the formation of cyclic diphosphirane fragments, and by the addition to one phosphorus atom with P=C bond formation. The latter route is more favorable as it exhibits lower reaction energy, however, in some cases, the formation of cyclic compounds upon the structure optimization has also been observed [27]. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no experimental studies on the functionalization of BPNS with carbene intermediates. In this work, we provide a strategy for BPNS functionalization with highly reactive dichlorocarbene intermediates by treating chloroform with potassium tert-butoxide in the presence of exfoliated BP. The resulting material was used as a metal-free catalyst for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)."

Chemical functionalization of BPNS with dichlorocarbene was performed by slow addition of a suspension of BPNS in chloroform to a suspension of potassium tert-butoxide in pentane (Figure 1). After functionalization, the obtained material (BP\u2013CCl2) was washed several times with water and isopropanol, dried in vacuo, and stored under a nitrogen atmosphere. The functionalized material was then characterized by various microscopic and spectroscopic methods.\nNanomaterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 2\u00a0 of\u00a0

It is worth noticing the appearance of signals at 192.7 and 227.3 cm\u22121, which correspond to edge phonons B1g and B13g in\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 826 4 of 14\nthe crystal lattice of the BP [28]. These signals also appear in the Raman spectrum of the functionalized BP\u2013CCl2 material, which indicates the retention of the overall crystallinity of the material. A slight shift of the A1g, B2g, and A2g phonon modes to the blue region (359.9, 435.3, and 462.5 cm\u22121, respectively) indicates the ultrathin nature of the 2D material [29]. In addition, the formation of new peaks in the regions of 175, 206, 245, 273, and 298 cm\u22121, as well as the formation of signals between A1g and B2g phonons in the region of 385\u2013397 cm\u22121, are also observed. The appearance of these signals, as well as the broadening of the A1g signal, in the BP\u2013CCl2 sample may indicate a distortion of the BP surface caused by the addition of a functionalizing agent. Thus, the formation of new signals in the Raman spectra in regions less than 400 cm\u22121 with especially pronounced signals in the regions of 250\u2013300 cm\u22121 was reported for BPNS functionalized with methyl and hexyl groups [20,30]. Similar results were obtained by Sofer et al., in which the appearance of signals in the region of 230 cm\u22121 is associated with the formation of a P\u2013C bond in BPNS functionalized with S-(bromomethyl) ethanethioate [19].\nNanomaterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 14\u00a0

= 6.58 ppm, 1JPH = 688 Hz) and H3PO4 (\u03b4 = 0.36 ppm) [32]. In addition, the spectra exhibit a signal at \u221210.85 pp , which may correspond to the P\u2013CCl2 covalent bond of the functionalized material. The analysis of the literature data has shown that the signals in this region of the 31P NMR spectra refer to organic phosphines, in which the P\u2013C bonds are realized [33\u201335], in contrast to the P=C bond, which is characterized by the signals in the regions of much lower fields [36]. In addition, similar signals in the 31P NMR spectrum are also observed for functionalized BP\u2013based materials with the P\u2013C covalent bond formation [18,37,38]. In this regard, we assume that in the BP\u2013CCl2 sample, the functionalization of BPNS with dichlorocarbenes most likely proceeds via the [1 + 2] cycloaddition reaction with two phosphorus atoms of the BP lattice with the formation of a cyclic P\u2013C\u2013P diphosphirane derivative, in contrast to the theoretical calculations [27]. In the integration of the signals in the 31P{1H} MAS NMR spectrum, the functionalization degree of the BP\u2013CCl2 sample was roughly estimated to be approximately 2.0%.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 826

The 31P (green line) and 31P{1H} (blue line) MAS NMR spectra and 1H\u219231P CPMAS NMR spectrum (red line) of BP\u2013CCl2.\nAdditionally, the 31P{1H} spectrum also contains a broadened signal at\u22124 ppm, which we could not identify; however, the changed signal shape in the 31P spectrum registered without proton decoupling may be due to a signal splitting, which in turn suggests the formation of the fragments containing one or more P\u2013H bonds. The spectra recorded in 1H\u219231P cross-polarization mode allow to determine the components containing hydrogen atoms at distances of one or two bonds from the corresponding phosphorus atom. Thus, the 1H\u219231P cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) NMR spectrum of the BP\u2013CCl2 sample exhibits signals at 6.47 and \u22124.92 ppm, which confirms the presence of P\u2013H bonds in these compounds. It is worth noticing the absence of CPMAS NMR signals at \u221210.85 ppm, which also implies the functionalization of the material with CCl2 groups. The P 2p core-level XPS spectrum of the BPNS sample (Figure 5a) exhibits characteristic lines assigned to P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2 peaks t binding energies of 131.0 and 130.1 eV, respectively, as well as a broad peak centered at 133.9 eV, assigned to the oxidized forms of phosphorus. The low intensity of the latter peak indicates the high quality of the starting material. The high-resolution P 2p XPS spectrum of BP\u2013CCl2 (Figure 5b) also exhibits the characteristic signals belonging to P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2 peaks at binding energies of 130.7 and 129.8 eV, respectively. A comparison of P 2p1/2 and P 2p3/2 peaks of BP\u2013 CCl2 with the correspondi g signals for pristine BPNS revealed that i the case of a functionalized material, a noticeable broadening and a shift of the doublet to the region of lower energies (by approximately 0.3 eV) are observed. These facts indicate the increased electron concentration, partial loss of long-range order, and the oxidation of P atoms on the surface of the BP\u2013CCl2 sample [39,40]. A similar effect was also observed by Shao et al. for BPNS functionalized with NH2 groups [41]. More important is the presence of the P\u2013C bond, which was detected at a binding energy of 133.3 eV in the P 2p spectrum of the BP\u2013CCl2 sample [30]. This suggests the covalent functionalization of BPNS with the P\u2013C bond formation. Comparison of the high-resolution C 1s core-level XPS spectra of BPNS and BP\u2013CCl2 (Figure 5c) showed a significant broadening of the signal in the case of the functionalized material, which indicates the presence of carbon-containing fragments of different compositions, apart from the substrate material. Thus, in addition to C sp2/sp3 at 284.8 eV, the C 1s spectrum of BP\u2013CCl2 could be deconvoluted into components with binding energies of\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 826 6 of 14\n284.0, 286.7, and 289.3 eV, corresponding to the C\u2013P, C\u2013Cl, and C=O bonds, respectively [42], which confirms the covalent functionalization of BPNS with CCl2 fragments.\nNanomaterials\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 6\u00a0 of\u00a0 14\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\ncompositions,\u00a0apart\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0substrate\u00a0material.\u00a0Thus,\u00a0in\u00a0addition\u00a0to\u00a0C\u00a0sp2/sp3\u00a0at\u00a0284.8\u00a0eV,\u00a0 the\u00a0C\u00a01s\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0BP\u2013CCl2\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0deconvoluted\u00a0into\u00a0components\u00a0with\u00a0binding\u00a0ener\u2010 gies\u00a0of\u00a0284.0,\u00a0286.7,\u00a0and\u00a0289.3\u00a0eV,\u00a0corresponding\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0C\u2013P,\u00a0C\u2013Cl,\u00a0and\u00a0C=O\u00a0bonds,\u00a0respec\u2010 tively\u00a0[42],\u00a0which\u00a0confirms\u00a0the\u00a0covalent\u00a0functionalization\u00a0of\u00a0BPNS\u00a0with\u00a0CCl2\u00a0fragments.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a05.\u00a0P\u00a02p\u00a0high\u2010resolution\u00a0XPS\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0BPNS\u00a0(a)\u00a0and\u00a0BP\u2013CCl2\u00a0(b).\u00a0Experimental\u00a0spectra,\u00a0fit\u2010\nting\u00a0 lines\u00a0and\u00a0background\u00a0 lines\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0as\u00a0black,\u00a0purple,\u00a0and\u00a0gray\u00a0 lines,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0 (c)\u00a0The\u00a0\ncomparison\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0C\u00a01s\u00a0high\u2010resolution\u00a0XPS\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0BPNS\u00a0and\u00a0BP\u2013CCl2.\u00a0(d)\u00a0C\u00a01s\u00a0high\u2010resolution\u00a0\nXPS\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0BP\u2013CCl2.\u00a0Experimental\u00a0spectrum\u00a0and\u00a0 fitting\u00a0 line\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0as\u00a0black\u00a0and\u00a0violet\u00a0\nlines,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0\nFourier\u2010transform\u00a0infrared\u00a0spectroscopy\u00a0(FT\u2010IR)\u00a0was\u00a0further\u00a0used\u00a0to\u00a0characterize\u00a0the\u00a0 BPNS\u00a0and\u00a0BP\u2013CCl2\u00a0samples\u00a0 (Figure\u00a06).\u00a0The\u00a0FT\u2010IR\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0BPNS\u00a0does\u00a0not\u00a0contain\u00a0 clearly\u00a0defined\u00a0peaks,\u00a0apart\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0low\u2010intensity\u00a0signals\u00a0related\u00a0to\u00a0angle\u00a0and\u00a0stretching\u00a0 vibrations\u00a0of\u00a0P\u2013OH\u00a0groups\u00a0at\u00a01262\u00a0and\u00a0864\u00a0cm\u22121,\u00a0respectively\u00a0[43],\u00a0which\u00a0are\u00a0observed\u00a0 upon\u00a0 the\u00a0partial\u00a0oxidation\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0material\u2019s\u00a0 surface.\u00a0The\u00a0BP\u2013CCl2\u00a0 sample\u00a0also\u00a0exhibits\u00a0 peaks\u00a0of\u00a0P\u2013OH\u00a0groups\u00a0at\u00a01255\u00a0and\u00a0864\u00a0cm\u22121,\u00a0as\u00a0well\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0doublet\u00a0at\u00a01020\u20131080\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0as\u2010 signed\u00a0to\u00a0stretching\u00a0vibrations\u00a0of\u00a0P\u2013O\u00a0groups\u00a0[43].\u00a0Notably,\u00a0the\u00a0spectrum\u00a0also\u00a0contains\u00a0 signals\u00a0at\u00a0797,\u00a0701,\u00a0and\u00a0662\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0belonging\u00a0to\u00a0vibrations\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0C\u2013Cl\u00a0bond\u00a0[44]\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0 asymmetric\u00a0and\u00a0symmetric\u00a0vibrations\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0P\u2013C\u00a0bond,\u00a0respectively\u00a0[45].\u00a0These\u00a0facts\u00a0ad\u2010 ditionally\u00a0suggest\u00a0the\u00a0covalent\u00a0functionalization\u00a0of\u00a0BPNS\u00a0with\u00a0dichlorocarbenes\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0 P\u2013C\u00a0bond\u00a0formation.\u00a0\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was further used to characterize the BPNS and BP\u2013CCl2 samples (Figure 6). The FT-IR spectrum of BPNS does not contain clearly defined peaks, apart from the low-intensity signals related to angle and stretching vibrations of P\u2013OH groups at 1262 and 864 cm\u22121, respectively [43], which are observed upon the partial oxidation of the material\u2019s surface. The BP\u2013CCl2 sample also exhibits peaks of P\u2013OH groups at 1255 and 864 cm\u22121, as well as the doublet at 1020\u20131080 cm\u22121 assigned to stretching vibrations of P\u2013O groups [43]. Notably, the spectrum also contains signals at 797, 701, and 662 cm\u22121 belonging to vibrations of the C\u2013Cl bond [44] and the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the P\u2013C bond, respectively [45]. These facts additionally suggest the covalent functionalization of BPNS with dichlorocarbenes with the P\u2013C bond formation. The electrocatalytic HER performances of BPNS and BP\u2013CCl2 samples were studied using a typical three-electrode cell in a 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. A catalyst-modified glassy carbon electrode (GC) was used as a working electrode. Figure 7a shows the linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) of BPNS and BP\u2013CCl2 recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s\u22121. Note that the functionalization of the BPNS surface with dichlorocarbene leads to a significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity in the studied process. Thus, the BP\u2013CCl2 sample exhibits HER activity with an overpotential of 442 mV vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a current density of \u22121 mA cm\u20132, which is 150 mV lower than that of the BPNS sample (592 mV). The improved catalytic activity may be due to the increased\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 826 7 of 14\nconcentration of active sites for hydrogen adsorption, which are formed upon the lattice distortion of the catalytically inert basal plane of BP in the functionalized material [46]. Similar effects of increased catalytic activity in edge-rich BPNS-based materials have been observed by Wang et. al. [47] and Yu et. al. [48].

(c) The fitting curve of BPNS and BP\u2013CCl2 between scan rate and current density variation (\u2206j = janode\u2013jcathode) at 50 mV (vs. RHE). (d) Nyquist diagrams of BPNS, BP\u2013CCl2, and glassy carbon el ctrode. The i set shows the equival circuit consisting of solution resistance, Rs, charge-transfer resistance, Rct, and constant phase element (CPE). (e) LSV curves of BP\u2013CCl2 initially and after 1000 cycles of CV recordings.\nThe kinetics of th electrocatalytic HER of the studied catalysts were investigated using Tafel plots (Figure 7b). The values of the Tafel slopes of BP\u2013CCl2 and BPNS l sts were 120 and 141 mV dec\u22121, respectively, which implies that for both compositions, the rate-determining step in electrochemical HER is the electrochemical hydrogen adsorption (Volmer process) [41]. A lower Tafel slope indicates faster kinetics on BP\u2013CCl2 compared to pristine BPNS. Next, using the electrochemical double-layer capacitance values (Cdl) found by recording the CV curves at different scan rates, we estimated the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of the modified electrodes. Figure 7c shows the dependence of the current density: \u2206j = janode \u2212 jca hode, on the potential scan rate recorded at a potential of 50 mV (vs.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 826 8 of 14\nRHE) for BPNS and BP\u2013CCl2 catalysts. The obtained data revealed that the functionalization of the material surface significantly increases the Cdl values from 0.33 mF cm\u22122 for BPNS to 0.59 mF cm\u22122 for BP\u2013CCl2. The corresponding ECSA is determined to be 0.69 and 0.39 cm2 for BP\u2013CCl2 and BPNS, respectively, indicating the 1.77 times increased ECSA value in BP\u2013CCl2 compared to the pristine BPNS. Thus, the BP\u2013CCl2 catalyst exhibits more abundant catalytically active sites, which significantly increase its activity in HER [41]. The Nyquist diagrams obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as well as the corresponding equivalent circuit of BPNS, BP\u2013CCl2, and GC, are shown in Figure 7d. Based on the radius of the semicircular Nyquist diagrams, the charge transfer resistances (Rct) of BPNS and BP\u2013CCl2 catalysts were calculated to be 13.12 and 6.25 k\u2126, respectively (Table 1). The lower Rct for BP\u2013CCl2 compared to pristine BPNS indicates a faster electron transfer rate for the BP\u2013CCl2 catalyst, which further improved the catalytic activity of the material in HER.\nThe stability of the BP\u2013CCl2 catalyst was tested by continuous CV sweeps with a scan rate of 100 mV s\u22121, from 0 to \u22120.6 V vs. RHE in a 1 M KOH solution. Notably, the LSV curve after 1000 cycles of CV recordings changed its morphology, showing the enhanced HER activity at a low current density (from 0 to \u22122.0 mA cm\u22122) and slightly decreased activity at a higher current density (\u2206E = 15 mV at \u22125.0 mA cm\u22122). These facts suggest the changes in the material\u2019s surface during the experiment, although they did not lead to a noticeable activity deterioration of the catalyst. Thus, the performed electrochemical experiments indicate an improved catalytic activity of the functionalized material in the electrochemical HER. The catalytic performance of BP-CCl2 is comparable to other metal-free catalysts of this process (Table 2).\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 826 9 of 14"

Organic solvents were distilled and stored under nitrogen before use. The commercially available reagent potassium tert-butoxide (98%, Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) was used as purchased. BP was obtained according to a modified procedure developed by Nilges [54]. The synthesis and characterization of BP have been published in our recent article [55]. In brief: 500 mg of red phosphorus, 364 mg of the Au/Sn alloy, and 10 mg of SnI4 were placed into a quartz ampoule 10 cm long and 10 mm in diameter (wall thickness 1 mm). The ampoule was sealed using a high-temperature burner in a vacuum (1 \u00d7 10\u22126 bar). Then, the ampoule was placed into a two-zone tube furnace in such a way that the temperature of the empty side of the ampoule during synthesis was maintained at approximately 50 \u25e6C lower than that of the sides with reagents. The ampoule with reagents was heated to 700 \u25e6C for 3 h. After that, the ampoule was kept at this temperature for 3 h, then slowly cooled to a temperature of 560 \u25e6C for 10 h. After cooling down, the ampoule was opened, and BP crystals formed at the empty side of the ampoule were transferred into a flask with 10 mL of toluene. The mixture was refluxed for 1 h, and after that the precipitate was decanted, dried in a vacuum (1 \u00d7 10\u22126 bar), and stored under nitrogen. The product yield was 451 mg (90%), and purity was 99.6% (according to X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analysis)."

            "text": "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of BP nanosheets were obtained on a Hitachi HT7700 transmission electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Samples were deposited on 300-mesh copper grids coated with formvar/carbon support film (Agar Scientific, Essex, UK) in the case of BPNS, and 300-mesh copper grids coated with lacey carbon support film (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) in the case of BP\u2013CCl2. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of BP, BPNS, and BP\u2013CCl2 were obtained on a Hitachi TM-1000 tabletop scanning electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and an emission current of 35.7 mA. The surface morphology of BP nanosheets was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in ambient conditions in tapping mode on a Titanium instrument (NT-MDT, Moscow, Russia) using a standard NSG-01 silicon cantilever (NT-MDT, Moscow, Russia) with a resonant oscillation frequency of 120 kHz. Solid-state NMR measurements were carried out on a Bruker AVANCE 400 WB NMR spectrometer (Bremen, Germany) at a temperature of T = 293 K. The measurements were carried out on the 31P nuclei at a frequency of 162.056 MHz. For measurements, a MAS 4 BL CP BB DVT (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) probe was used. The studied samples were packed into a 4 mm zirconium oxide rotor and were rotated at the magic angle with a rotation speed of 12 kHz. The duration of the exciting 90-degree pulses for phosphorus nuclei was 3.4 \u00b5s. The standard impulse programs zg, hpdec, and cp were used. The number of points in the time domain was the same for all experiments and was equal to 2048. The number of FID accumulations varied from 256 to 512 to obtain an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. The time between FID accumulations in experiments on phosphorus nuclei was 20 s. The width of the spectra obtained for phosphorus nuclei was 69.5 kHz. In experiments with cross-polarization, the time varied from 1 to 5 ms to obtain the maximum signal. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed in a UHV chamber (base pressure \u223c5 \u00d7 10\u221210 mbar) equipped with an Al K\u03b1 X-ray source operated at 12.5 kV and 250 W, and a Phoibos 150 hemispherical energy analyzer (all from SPECS GmbH, Berlin, Germany). A pass energy of 100 eV (step size of 1 eV) was used for widerange scans (survey), while 20 eV pass energies (step size of 0.1 eV, 25 scans) were used for high-resolution measurements. Peak shifts due to any apparent charging were calibrated\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 826 10 of 14\nwith the carbon C 1s peak set to 284.8 eV. XPS spectra registered from experimental samples were analyzed with the CasaXPS software (Casa Software Ltd., Teignmouth, UK). Raman spectra were collected with the Raman spectrometer SENTERRA (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). In order to register Raman spectra, linearly polarized light with a wavelength of 532 nm was used. Focusing of the laser beam on the surface of the sample was performed using a 100\u00d7 objective with a numerical aperture of 0.9 (180\u25e6 configuration). The laser power used in spectroscopic experiments was 2 mW. The exposure time was 60 s. Raman spectra were recorded within a spectral range of 45\u20133700 cm\u22121 with a resolution of 3\u20135 cm\u22121. FT-IR spectra (500\u20134000 cm\u22121) were recorded using a Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an ATR accessory (MIRacle, PIKE Technologies, Madison, WI, USA). Background spectra obtained from 64 scans with a resolution of 2 cm\u22121 have been subtracted from the sample spectra. Electrochemical studies of the HER were carried out using a BASI EC Epsilon potentiostat (West Lafayette, IN, USA) equipped with an RDE-2 cell stand in a three-electrode system, using Pt wire as an auxiliary electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, and a catalyst-modified glassy carbon rotating disk electrode as a working electrode. To modify the electrode, a suspension consisting of 1 mg of the catalyst, 0.5 mL of isopropanol, and 10 \u00b5L of a 5% Nafion binder solution was prepared, which was dispersed by sonication for 10 min. Then, 5 \u00b5L of the resulting mixture was drop-casted to the electrode surface and dried in a vacuum. Voltammograms were recorded in 1 M KOH at a linear potential scan rate of 5 mV s\u22121 at the electrode rotation speed of 800 rpm. In all measurements, the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the formula: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.222 + 0.059 \u00d7 pH. For the 1 M KOH medium: ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 1.048 V. To estimate the electrochemically active surface area of the catalyst (ECSA), cyclic voltammograms were measured in a non-Faradaic region from 0 to 100 mV vs. RHE at scan rates of 5, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mV s\u22121. The double-layer capacitance of the system, Cdl, was determined by plotting the dependence of the current density difference between the anode and cathode sweep: \u2206j = janode \u2212 jcathode, taken at a potential of 50 mV on the potential scan rate. Cdl was calculated according to the formula: Cdl = k/2, where k is the slope of the linear fit of this data. ECSA can be calculated as: ECSA = S (Cdl/Cs), where S is the electrode area (0.07 cm2), and Cs is the specific capacitance value for a flat standard with 1 cm2 of real surface area. The general value of Cs is between 20 and 60 \u00b5F cm\u22122. The Cs value of 60 \u00b5F cm\u22122 was used to determine the ECSA in this study. The electrochemical impedance (EIS) spectra were recorded using CHI Electrochemical Workstation 660E (CH Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) at the equilibrium potential with the amplitude of applied sine potential of 5 mV, and the frequency varied in the range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz in the presence of 0.01 M K3[Fe(CN)6] and 0.01 M K4[Fe(CN)6]. The equilibrium potential was calculated as the half-sum of the cathodic and anodic peak potentials of the [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212/4\u2212 peak pair. The impedance parameters were calculated from the Nyquist diagrams obtained from five successive registrations of EIS spectra with the R(RC) equivalent circuit using NOVA software (version 1.11.2 Metrohm Autolab b.v., Utrecht, The Netherlands)."

The structure and composition of the obtained BP\u2013CCl2 material were elucidated and thoroughly characterized using a variety of spectroscopic methods. The obtained data suggest that the functionalization of BPNS with CCl2 moieties proceeds via three-membered P\u2013C\u2013P ring formation. This functionalization of the BPNS surface led to enhanced performance of the BP\u2013CCl2 nano-catalyst in the electrochemical HER in alkaline media. It was shown that the BP\u2013CCl2 material exhibited the overpotential of 442 mV at a current density of \u22121 mA cm\u22122 and significantly outperformed the pristine BPNS. Our study provides a new route for the preparation of BP-based functional materials using carbene precursors and promotes the development of new metal-free electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.M.K.
