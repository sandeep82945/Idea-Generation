Expanding Compartmental Models with Piecewise Fractional-Order Derivatives: While the current model focuses on susceptible and infected compartments, future work could introduce additional compartments such as exposed (E), recovered (R), and deceased (D), to capture the full spectrum of disease progression and recovery. This expansion would allow for a more detailed analysis of disease dynamics and the effectiveness of various intervention strategies.

Application to Other Infectious Diseases: The piecewise fractional-order derivative approach could be applied to model the spread of other infectious diseases, particularly those with complex transmission dynamics or significant variations in infectiousness over time. Diseases with fluctuating transmission rates, such as influenza or dengue fever, could benefit from this modeling approach to better understand and predict outbreak patterns.

Incorporating Behavioral and Social Dynamics: Future models could integrate behavioral and social dynamics that influence disease spread, such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and vaccination uptake. By combining the piecewise fractional-order derivative model with models of human behavior, researchers could explore how changes in population behavior affect disease dynamics and identify optimal strategies for disease control.

Development of Advanced Numerical Methods: The paper highlights the use of the Euler method for numerical analysis. Future research could focus on developing and applying more advanced numerical methods tailored for piecewise fractional-order differential equations. These methods could offer greater accuracy and efficiency in simulating disease dynamics, particularly for complex models with multiple compartments and non-linear interactions.

Real-time Data Integration and Model Calibration: Integrating real-time data into the modeling framework could enhance the model's predictive capabilities and relevance for public health decision-making. Future research could focus on developing methods for real-time model calibration and adjustment based on incoming data on case counts, vaccination rates, and changes in public health measures. This would allow for more timely and accurate predictions of disease spread and the impact of interventions.
