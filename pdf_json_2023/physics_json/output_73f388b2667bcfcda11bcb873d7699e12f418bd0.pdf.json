In the absence of background ions, neodymium\nions compensate the surface charge of the arachidic acid film at 50 M bulk concentration without\nany charge reversal. Increasing the bulk concentration to 1 mM does not change the neodymium surface coverage but affects the interfacial water structure significantly. In the presence of a high concentration of background salt, NaCl, there is overcharging at 1mM of Nd3+ i.e., 30% more Nd3+ than needed to compensate the surface charge. The overcharging trend with and without salts is different than those observed at mineral/water interface, emphasizing the importance of surface properties. These results show that the total coverage of neodymium ions is not enough to describe the complete picture at the interface, and interfacial water and ion coverage needs to be considered together to understand more complex ion adsorption and transport processes.\nIon adsorption and transport at charged interfaces are central to many important phenomena. Living cell membranes selectively transport ions.1 Batteries transport ions through electrode surfaces.2 Stability of colloids depend on the ions in the solution.3 Chemical separations require selective ion adsorption and transfer.4-13 A molecular scale understanding of ion-surface-water interactions is crucial for addressing the key challenges in these fields.\nIn the classical picture of a charged interface, including Stern and diffuse layers of electric double layer (EDL), the total charge of the counterions adsorb at the interface cannot exceed the surface charge. However, in the last two decades many experimental and theoretical studies have demonstrated that the charge of adsorbed ions can exceed the surface charge, leading to a charge reversal or overcharging.14-19 The origin of the overcharging can be chemical, i.e. specific interactions or chemical bonding between ions and the surface functional groups may lead to overcharging.20 The overcharging may also originate from purely electrostatic interactions. Especially with multivalent ions, ion-ion correlations favor overcharging.21-22 In highly concentrated solutions,23-24 or under applied electric field,25 overcharging may even happen with monovalent ions.\nFloating surfactant layers at the air/aqueous interface (Langmuir monolayers) are useful model systems to study ion adsorption and interfacial water at flat interfaces.7-10, 26-32 They provide high charge density (up to 1 e- / 20 \u00c52 or ~0.8 C/m2) for single chain surfactants and are highly accessible to surface specific experimental probes. Most commonly used probes include sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence near total reflection (XFNTR), and anomalous X-ray reflectivity (a-XR). XFNTR and a-XR provide a direct measure of total number of interfacial ions exploiting the element specific X-ray absorption edge of the ions.18, 20 SFG\nspectroscopy provides an indirect measure of ion adsorption, through the changes happening to the interfacial water structure or the surface functional groups.26-27, 33\nRecently, Sthoer et al. reported an observation of overcharging of Y3+ and La3+ ions at arachidic acid (AA) monolayers with SFG spectroscopy.27 The intensity of -OH region signal (3200 \u2013 3700 cm-1) decreased as the bulk concentration is increased from 100 nM to 10 M, which is typical\ndue to the decreasing surface charge and disturbed interfacial water organization. However, as the bulk concentration was increased further to 0.1 mM the SFG signal increased again. The increase in SFG signal has been interpreted as the overcharging of the interface by trivalent ions\u2019 adsorption, causing a net electric field at the interface. Interestingly, in an earlier study with a very similar system Wang et al. used XFNTR to show that La3+ ions simply compensate the surface charge by adsorbing at 1:3 ratio.20 This apparent contradiction can be due to an error in one (or both) of the measurements or it can be due to a problem in the assumptions in data interpretation. As a third possibility, we hypothesize that our typical understanding of EDL is too simplistic and require an improvement to explain both studies simultaneously. Also, the chemistry of the charged surface and the solution conditions, such as background salts, needs to be considered carefully.\nIn this study, we utilize both SFG and XFNTR techniques to elucidate the Nd3+ adsorption at AA monolayers in detail and reconcile the apparent contradiction in the literature (Figure 1). By studying ion adsorption with and without background salts, we show that -OH region SFG signal is not always an ideal probe to infer ion adsorption, due to the ambiguity created by multiple effects, such as the hydration shell of the ions or interference effects.30, 34-35 On the other hand, XFNTR cannot provide some details of ion distribution, because it is sensitive only to the total number of ions in both Stern and diffuse layers and insensitive to the reorganization of ions\nbetween them.28 Acknowledging the advantages and shortcomings of both methods allows elucidating the details of trivalent ion adsorption that cannot be determined by a single method.\nFigure 2 shows the variation of the neodymium surface coverage at AA monolayers as a function of total Nd concentration ([Nd]t) obtained by the corresponding XFNTR results (Figure S1). Ndcoverage at the monolayer surface increases monotonically both with and without the background salt (NaCl). In the absence of NaCl, the surface coverage saturates at a value of ~ 0.016 Nd/\u00c52. This value agrees with the Nd-coverage required for monolayer charge neutralization by Nd3+ as there is 1 AA molecule per 20 \u00c52. Nd3+ is the predominant species in the bulk solution at the pH\n~5.5-6 used here. This value is also in agreement with the surface coverage obtained with La3+ ions at 0.1 mM under AA monolayer.20\nIn the presence of 0.5 M NaCl, when [Nd]t is below 10 \u03bcM, the surface coverage of Nd species is lowered relative to the no-salt case, due to the competition between Na+ and Nd3+ (Figure 2). At [Nd]t = 0.1 mM, the surface coverage reaches ~ 0.016 Nd/ \u00c5 2. At 1 mM of [Nd]t in the solution, the surface coverage of Nd is ~ 0.022 per \u00c52, significantly higher than that expected for charge neutrality of AA headgroups by trivalent ions. Evidently, 0.5 M background salt enhances the \u201csalting out\u201d of Nd3+ ions enabling overcharging which is not possible in the absence of background salt. This is especially important for chemical separation of rare earths, where highly concentrated solutions are typical in process conditions.24 There is an interplay of interfacial hydration and ion adsorption to the monolayers, which can be expected to play a major role especially in the case of strongly hydrated trivalent cations.22, 36 We next focus on SFG results under same conditions.\nVariation of the SFG spectra in the OH stretching region with increasing [Nd]t concentration in water is shown in Figure 2a. The two bands roughly centered at 3250 and 3550 cm-1 wavenumbers are attributed to the relatively stronger and weaker hydrogen bonded water molecules, respectively.33 At a relatively low [Nd]t of 400 nM, the OH region is significantly affected with a near uniform drop in the bimodal intensities. From the XFNTR results (Figure 2) this corresponds to ~ 1/3 coverage of Nd3+ species. As the Nd3+ coverage increases to that required for full charge compensation, at ~ 10 \u03bcM [Nd]t, the OH region is nearly flat with total loss of the typical bimodal feature of interfacial water. Interestingly, although the surface coverage of Nd species does not change with further increasing the [Nd]t, the corresponding SFG shows a continual change in the OH region. At and above ~ 50 \u03bcM [Nd]t, there is a prominent peak at ~ 3150 cm -1 which\nstrengthens with increasing [Nd]t. Simultaneous with the appearance of this 3150cm -1 peak, there are two weaker peaks appearing at ~3450 cm-1 and 3700 cm-1 (not modeled in the fits). Sthoer et al., have interpreted the appearance of these peaks as indications of \u201covercharging\u201d.27 Our XFNTR results clearly negate this interpretation. Further, the red-shift of the peaks with respect to the water/AA spectrum, and the changes in the overall shape of the spectra (higher 3150 cm-1 peak relative to 3450 cm-1 peak, as opposed to the higher 3550 cm-1 peak relative to the 3250 cm-1 peak in water/AA spectrum) reflect complex changes in the interfacial hydration in the presence of Nd species, rather than reorientation of water molecules due to the reversal of the surface charge.\nIn the presence of 0.5M NaCl, the OH region is affected differently by the adsorption of Nd3+ to the monolayer (Figure 2b). Without Nd3+ in the solution, the OH region looks qualitatively similar to the corresponding spectra in water/AA system (violet trace in Figure 2a) as has been previously reported.37 Studies with varying NaCl concentrations under AA monolayers have posited that the low signal in the water/AA system, which is comparable to a very high ionic strength system, is due to the destructive interference of SFG signal coming from the sample depth.30, 34 The persistence of OH signal at very high [NaCl] has been attributed to the finite size of the counterion (Na+) which limits the charge screening when the Debye length is low.37\nWith the addition of NdCl3 to the subphase, 3250 and 3550 cm -1 bands decrease gradually in contrast to the immediate decrease in the absence of the background salt (Figure 2b). At 1 mM of [Nd]t, there is a peak appearing at ~ 3150 cm -1, similar to the no-salt condition but with a relatively lower intensity. We note that at this highest concentration of Nd3+ with 0.5 M NaCl background, the Nd3+ ions indeed overcharge the interface (Figure 2). Therefore, the 3150 cm-1 peak appears regardless of the overcharging and is actually weaker when overcharging happens. This shows that the resurgence of the OH stretching mode signal is not a good indicator of Nd concentration at the\nsurface. The OH region is significantly affected by solvent reorganization, in addition to the ion adsorption, which prohibits drawing direct conclusions about the interfacial composition in terms of metal coverage.38\nIn addition to -OH vibrations of water, symmetric stretching mode of COO- group has been used to evaluate the ion-monolayer interactions with fatty acid monolayers.26-27, 30, 37 Figure 3 shows the SFG spectra corresponding to this peak with and without the salt background. There is an increase in peak strength and a shift in peak position with increasing [Nd]t both with and without salt background, though concentration dependent trends are different. The spectral shape seem to match better with the results of Sthoer et al.,27 than those of Sung et al.,26 who report a bimodal\npeak shape which they attribute to a mix of bare COO- and lanthanide-COO- complex. Sthoer et al. have studied the carboxylate stretching region thoroughly, modeling this region as a sum of three differing modes of carboxylate-lanthanide interactions.27 Due to the low signal to noise ratio in our spectra, we have used a single peak to fit the data. This region is also affected by the CH and OH bending modes further complicating quantitative analysis.30 The peak amplitudes from the single Lorentzian fits are shown in Figure 5. In the absence of background salt, the peak amplitude\nsaturates around 1 M but increases again at the highest concentration. In the presence of the\nbackground salt, the signal increases continuously but with two different slopes, where the change\nin slope happens around 1 M.\nWhen considered altogether, our results provide a detailed picture of Nd3+ adsorption at AA monolayers. It is clear that electrostatic attraction can bring Nd3+ ions to the interface even at very\nlow bulk concentrations. However, the strongly hydrated Nd3+ does not interact with the AA headgroup directly because it cannot shed the hydration shell. This leads to an adsorption that can be described as Figure 1a or 1b. The partial dehydration of Nd3+ happens differently in the absence and the presence of the NaCl background. We observe that the concentration dependent trends in -OH and -COO SFG signals are more monotonic in the presence of NaCl (Figure 3b and Figure 4b). In contrast, without any background salt, both signals show a big jump at very low concentrations and then remain relatively constant over 100x change in the bulk Nd3+ concentration (Figure 3a and 4a). However, the XFNTR trends that provide the direct measure of interfacial Nd3+ coverages are very similar for salt and no-salt conditions over the same concentration range (Figure 2). Clearly, the presence of excess background ions helps Nd3+ to dehydrate easily and interact with the headgroups causing more significant changes in SFG signal.\nWe hypothesize that the appearance of 3150 cm-1 peak in the -OH region around 1 mM bulk Nd3+ concentration is an indication of majority of Nd3+ ions partially dehydrating and directly coordinating to the AA headgroups and the signal mainly originates from the first coordination shell of the Nd3+ ions. XFNTR is not sensitive to the hydration state of the metal ion or its exact location next to the interface while SFG does not directly detect the metal ion (Figure 1). We hypothesize that the changes in SFG spectra in OH region are indicative of the changing interfacial hydration in response to the adsorption of the trivalent cations which have a strong hydration shell.36 Using a combination of X-ray based techniques and SFG, we have reported similar changes in interfacial hydration structures in response to adsorption of anionic complexes to positively charged surfaces.8, 28-29\nFormation of ion-pairs in bulk solutions with multivalent ions has been shown to induce structural changes in the hydration layers.39 Using Raman-difference spectroscopy, Patra et al.,\nhave shown that the first hydration layer of lanthanides has OH stretching modes that are red shifted compared to bulk water.40 Further, they also report a peak ~ 3600 cm-1 attributed to the second hydration shell. Our results with Nd adsorption to the fatty acid monolayer qualitatively mirror the above findings, supporting our hypothesis that the changes in OH spectra are arising mainly due to metal-induced hydration changes.\nAs we focused only on AA/Nd3+ systems here, we note that the surface structure and chemistry plays an important role, and on mineral,21 graphene,22 and graphene oxide41-42 surfaces significantly different ion adsorption trends had been reported. Even the headgroup chemistry may lead to significant differences. For instance, phospholipid/La3+ systems show clear signs of charge reversal in both X-ray based and SFG based studies.17-18 Specific interactions between the phosphate headgroup of DMPA and La3+ were proposed as the cause of that overcharging effect. It is also interesting that Lee at al. observed overcharging of Y3+ ions at muscovite mica surface in the absence of any background salts and no overcharging with NaCl background. This trend appears to be opposite to our observation. We suggest that the surface structure and chemistry differences between mica and AA monolayers are responsible for this difference. Hydrophobicity of air/water interface allow \u201csalting out\u201d effect to dominate, while competition of Na+ ions become important at hydrophilic mica interface. However, a separate study is needed to elucidate the details.\nThe character of the trivalent ion may also be important in overcharging. Nd is a light lanthanide with a relatively larger ionic radius, and therefore lower charge density. Heavy lanthanides have smaller radius and therefore higher charge density. In this study we focused on Nd and showed that it does not induce overcharging. This does not rule out the possibility that heavy lanthanides overcharging under similar conditions. For example, light and heavy lanthanides interact\ncompletely different with DHDP, a phospholipid similar to DMPA but lacking the OH group. Although light lanthanides adsorb at DHDP monolayers without overcharging, heavier lanthanides cause formation of inverted bilayers.10, 13\nBehavior of ions at charged interfaces is a central question in separation science, energy storage, and atmospheric chemistry. Due to the complexity inherent to the interfaces, a thorough description requires consolidation of results from various techniques that are sensitive to different aspects of the interfaces. Here we have shown the utility of combining SFG and X-ray fluorescence to investigate the structure of interfaces with adsorbed Nd3+ ions next to negatively charged monolayers. We do not find any evidence of overcharging in the absence of background salt, up to a [Nd]t of 1 mM, and consequently we interpret the changes in OH stretch region of SFG as indicators of changes in interfacial hydration due to lanthanide adsorption. There is XFNTR evidence of overcharging at 1 mM [Nd]t in the presence of 0.5M NaCl. This shows that the OH region is sensitive to multiple factors with regards to ion adsorption and hydration and cannot be simply interpreted as a measure of ion adsorption or monolayer charge. We also demonstrated that the total coverage determined by X-ray studies is not enough to describe the interfacial distribution of the ions. The factors, such as the background salts and the surface functional groups, may significantly affect the hydration of the ions, which in return can enhance or hinder the ion transport in many applications. These results signify the need for a multipronged approach to address interfacial adsorption of ions to avoid overdrawn conclusions based on a single technique."
