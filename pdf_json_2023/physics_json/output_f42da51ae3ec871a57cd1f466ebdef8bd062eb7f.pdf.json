    "abstractText": "In this study, inert dry bioadsorbents prepared from corn cob residues (CCR), cocoa husk (CH), plantain peels (PP), and cassava peels (CP) were used as adsorbents of heavy metal ions (Pb2+ and Ni2+) in single-batch adsorption experiments from synthetic aqueous solutions. The physicochemical properties of the bioadsorbents and the adsorption mechanisms were evaluated using different experimental techniques. The results showed that electrostatic attraction, cation exchange, and surface complexation were the main mechanisms involved in the adsorption of metals onto the evaluated bioadsorbents. The percentage removal of Pb2+ and Ni2+ increased with higher adsorbent dosage, with Pb2+ exhibiting greater biosorption capacity than Ni2+. The bioadsorbents showed promising potential for adsorbing Pb2+ with monolayer adsorption capacities of 699.267, 568.794, 101.535, and 116.820 mg/g when using PP, CCR, CH, and CP, respectively. For Ni2+, Langmuir\u2019s parameter had values of 10.402, 26.984, 18.883, and 21.615, respectively, for PP, CCR, CH, and CP. Kinetics data fitted by the pseudo-second-order model revealed that the adsorption rate follows this order: CH > CP > CCR > PP for Pb2+, and CH > CCR > PP > CP for Ni2+. The adsorption mechanism was found to be controlled by ion exchange and precipitation. These findings suggest that the dry raw biomasses of corn cob residues, cocoa husk, cassava, and plantain peels can effectively remove lead and nickel, but further research is needed to explore their application in industrial-scale and continuous systems.",

            "text": "Agroindustrial activities generate a significant number of residues, which can pose a challenge for sustainable waste management. These residues arise from different processes, such as crop cultivation, harvesting, processing, and packaging [1]. They can be composed of organic matter, plant debris, and agrochemicals. The proper disposal of these residues is crucial to minimizing their negative impact on the environment and human health. Improper handling can lead to soil and water contamination, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. However, these residues can also be a valuable source of renewable energy and bio-based products through their conversion into biogas, biofuels, and other value-added products [2]. Therefore, the development of efficient and sustainable waste management strategies for agroindustrial residues is critical to promoting environmental sustainability and circular economy practices. Reusing residues from agroindustrial activities as bioadsorbents is gaining attention due to its potential to reduce waste and promote the circular economy. Many agroindustrial processes generate significant amounts of residues, which are often considered a problem for disposal. However, these residues can also be a valuable resource if properly utilized.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16134884 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 2 of 25\nBy converting them into bioadsorbents, they can be used to remove contaminants from wastewater, air, and soil while also reducing the need for synthetic adsorbents. This approach promotes the principles of zero waste and the circular economy, which aim to minimize waste generation and maximize resource utilization [3]. Heavy metal contamination refers to the presence of toxic elements such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic in the environment, usually as a result of human activities such as industrial processes, mining, and improper disposal of waste [4]. This contamination can seriously affect human health and the ecosystem, including neurological damage, cancer, and reduced plant growth [5]. Some of the most dangerous heavy metals present in water include lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and chromium. Exposure to these metals can cause serious health problems, such as cancer, neurological disorders, organ damage, and developmental abnormalities [6]. They can also accumulate in the food chain, posing a risk to animals and humans who consume contaminated food or water [7]. Therefore, it is important to monitor and prevent the contamination of water sources with these hazardous materials. Lead can enter water supplies through corroded pipes and plumbing systems, as well as through industrial waste and mining runoff. The effects of lead exposure can be devastating for humans, animals, and the environment [8]. It can cause serious health problems such as brain damage, reduced cognitive function, anemia, and impaired growth and development [9]. For animals, lead exposure can lead to reduced fertility and weakened immune systems [10]. Lead pollution can also have long-lasting effects on the environment, including damage to soil quality and water sources. Therefore, it is important to implement measures to prevent lead pollution and mitigate its harmful effects. Nickel is a toxic heavy metal that can contaminate water sources through industrial activities, the natural weathering of rocks, and soil erosion [11]. Exposure to high levels of nickel can cause adverse health effects in humans, such as skin irritation, respiratory problems, kidney damage, and even cancer [12,13]. Nickel also affects animals, disrupting their growth and reproduction. Additionally, the accumulation of nickel in the environment can lead to ecosystem disturbances and affect plant growth and biodiversity [14]. Therefore, monitoring and regulating nickel concentrations in water sources is crucial to mitigating negative impacts on human health and the environment. Several physicochemical methods are employed to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions, including solvent extraction [15], ion exchange [16], chemical precipitation [17], photoelectrocatalytic methods [18], electrocatalytic methods [19], reverse osmosis [20], and membrane separation [21]. However, certain techniques necessitate energy consumption, chemical additives, and face limitations when dealing with concentrations below 60 mg/L [18,22]. Consequently, there is a significant need to develop efficient and costeffective separation processes. Accordingly, bioadsorption offers a viable alternative to achieve the desired objective, which necessitates the development of new adsorbents with efficient adsorption capacities [23]. The utilization of biomass derived from agricultural residues as adsorbents has been extensively investigated due to its low cost, immediate availability, and high removal efficiency. Various bioadsorbents, including wood-derived biochar [24], plantain peels [22,25], Nitrile amidoximation of manna tree [26], Date palm biochar [27], rice husk [28], Carbon from cassava peels activated with KOH [29], Peat moss [30], potato husks [31], lemon [32], coffee pulp [33], and other residues, have been tested for the removal of these types of contaminants [34,35]. In this study, the efficiency of the raw biomasses of plantain peels (PP), corn cob residues (CCR), cocoa husk (CH), and cassava peels (CP) was evaluated for removing three heavy metals (lead and nickel) from aqueous solutions. These residues were considered precursors of bioadsorbents. Colombia is an agricultural country where a wide variety of crops are harvested. Banana production in Colombia is estimated at 1.7 million tons per year, of which approximately 40% by mass is peel, resulting in the generation of around 680,000 tons of banana peel per year [36]. Additionally, in the country, around 1.9 million tons of traditional yellow corn are produced annually, of which 30% by mass is a residue known as corn cobs\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 3 of 25\nor corn husks, amounting to 570,000 tons per year [37]. Regarding cocoa, in Colombia, 62,158 tons were produced in 2022, of which the husk accounts for between 52% and 70% of the wet weight of the fruit, amounting to approximately 32,300\u201343,500 tons of this residue [38]. In the country, around 400,000 tons of cassava peels are generated annually as a residue from the 2 million tons collected, which represents 20% of its weight [39]. Thus, the effects of adsorption time, pH, dosage, particle size, temperature, and initial ion concentration were studied in detail. Other parameters such as distribution coefficient, adsorption isotherm, kinetics, and statistical analysis of the adsorption process were also evaluated. The adsorption capacities of these biomasses were assessed by Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin- Radushkevich (D-R), Redlich-Peterson (R-P), and Temkin adsorption isotherm models. The main objectives of the present study were: (1) to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the bioadsorbents under study for the removal of two specific heavy metals (lead and nickel); and (2) to identify the adsorption mechanisms involved in the adsorption of the heavy metals."

            "text": "The bioadsorption technology implies a complex phenomenon with several steps; therefore, many factors affect this phenomenon. Among these, the surface chemistry of the studied biomasses has a considerable impact on the process. Thus, the surface of the bioadsorbents was studied by B\u00f6ehm titration and pH point of zero charge, as well as FTIR and SEM-EDX, before and after the removal of Pb (II) and Ni (II).\nSurface Properties\nThe pH point of zero charge (pHPZC) defines the pH at which the net surface charge is zero; at this pH, the adsorbent\u2019s surface neither attracts nor repels ions, and it exhibits\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 5 of 25\nminimal reactivity. The pHPZC is an essential parameter for characterizing adsorbents\u2019 surface properties, particularly for the design and optimization of adsorption processes [42]. The pHPZC is found to be 4.29, 4.79, 4.65, and 5.92 for PP, CCR, CP, and CH, respectively. The above results are coherent with the quantification of the surface functional groups obtained via the Boehm method shown in Table 2, considering that pHPZC depends on the type of functional groups present in the amphoteric surface of bioadsorbents [43]. Therefore, the surface is positively charged for pH values below pHpzc and negatively charged for higher pH values. For red beet peel, a pHPZC of 5.48 was obtained, indicating that at pH < 5.48, the surface of the biomass will be positively charged and the affinity with the anions will be higher [43]. Further, similar results have been reported for banana peels (pHPZC 5.63), gibto seed peel (4.3) [44], pumpkin peel biochar (5.5) [45], and groundnut husk modified with Guar Gum (7.0) [46].\nNote: The analysis was carried out in triplicate; the standard deviation of results is \u00b10.002. B\u00f6ehm titration is used to determine the surface acidity of a bioadsorbent. The method involves titrating the sample with different basic solutions and measuring the amount of base required to neutralize the surface acidic groups; the results are expressed as the total acidity of the surface in milliequivalents per gram. This method allows one to understand the surface chemistry and reactivity of the material, which are important for bioadsorption processes [47]. According to the results in Table 2, it is observed that the bioadsorbents have more acidic groups due to the presence of carboxylic and phenolic species in their structure and no lactone groups, which is attributed to the lignocellulosic nature of the biomasses. These results are coherent with the pHPZC values presented in Figure 1, which are proportional to the acidic and basic functions. Similar results were presented for cassava tubes, with zero lactone groups [29]. For a biochar from oil palm fiber, it was reported values of 1.65, 0.2, and 0.15 mmol/g of carboxylic, phenolic, and lactone groups, respectively; this appearance of lactone groups decreases the quantity of the basic functions due to the carbonization phenomenon [48]. For pomegranate peel, it has been reported that the concentration of the acidic functions is more important on its surface [49]. Figure 2 displays the results of the bromatological analysis conducted on the bioadsorbents. Carbon was found to be the primary component, followed by hydrogen, which aligns with the expected composition considering the presence of these elements in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin molecules.

All bioadsorbents exhibited their best performance at pH 6. Thus, at a lower pH, there is a higher concentration of H+ in the solutions, which would compete with the Pb2+ and Ni2+ for the active centers on the surface of the adsorbents, causing a decrease in the binding between the metals and the bioadsorbent. It has been reported that the adsorption efficiency of Pb2+ and Ni2+ is enhanced when the pH is increased, and more functional groups appear for the removal of cations due to the reduction of H+ concentration, enhancing the adsorption of the ions [46]. Thus, the increase in removal with pH may be due to the\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 10 of 25\ndecreasing electrostatic repulsion between the ions and the positively charged surface of the bioadsorbents at pH higher than pHPZC (Figure 1); in addition, maximum elimination occurs for both ions at pH 6, where the hydrolyzed species of the ions are more soluble than the cations, considering the speciation of Pb2+ [63] and Ni2+ [64].

            "text": "Particle size and adsorbent dose are crucial parameters affecting the bioadsorption process of heavy metals. Particle size determines the specific surface area available for adsorption [65], while adsorbent dose affects the amount of binding sites available for heavy metals [34]. A balance between these two parameters is necessary to achieve optimal bioadsorption efficiency. Understanding the effect of particle size and adsorbent dose on bioadsorption is essential for the development of effective and sustainable methods for heavy metal removal from contaminated water and wastewater. In addition, the temperature plays a crucial role in the heavy metal bioadsorption process as it affects the kinetics, thermodynamics, and stability of the adsorbent [66]. The adsorption of Pb2+ and Ni2+ in the four raw biomasses is shown in Table 4 for the experiments presented in the central composition design (Table 1). At the end of the tests, the residual amount of lead and nickel in the solution was measured, and the adsorbed quantity was calculated using Equations (1) and (2). For the improvement of the process efficiency, the response surface methodology approach (RSM) was used because this method allows to explain the statistical main effect of the most significant parameters, its interaction with other parameters, and their quadratic effect that have impacts on the responses. Based on the application of RSM, a model was developed from the experimental data (Supplementary files: Table S1) for each system bioadsorbent-metal with the coefficient of determination (R2). The regression models calculated were used to explain the interactions between the coded and evaluated factors and the response. The model equations were tested and analyzed using the t-test and the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA showed a 90% confidence level (Supplementary Files: Tables S2\u2013S9), which means the regression is statistically significant for the systems CCRPb2+, CP-Ni2+, and CP-Pb2+, with the interactions AA and CC being the most influential factors when using CCR, and the temperature and the interaction CC when using CP; the above, accordingly, with a p-value lower than 0.05. From the study of the temperature effect over the adsorption process, it is possible to analyze the thermodynamic behavior of the system, which involves analyzing the entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy changes during the adsorption process [67]. These thermodynamic parameters can help predict the feasibility and spontaneity of the process. Additionally, the effect of temperature on particle size and adsorbent dose must also be investigated to optimize the bioadsorption process for heavy metals. From Table 5, the negative value of the adsorption enthalpy (\u2206H\u25e6) indicates that the adsorption process is exothermic, as it releases energy in the bonding of the ions to the functional groups of the bioadsorbents [68]. The heat formed during the process is due to the condensation of the adsorbate plus the energy generated in the adsorbent-adsorbate bonding. The negative value of the adsorption entropy (\u2206S\u25e6) indicates low reversibility in the process and low randomness in the liquid-solid interface in the adsorption process [69]. Furthermore, the negative values of the Gibbs free energy (\u2206G\u25e6) at all evaluated temperatures indicate that the removal of the metal occurs spontaneously for the adsorption of Pb2+ and Ni2+ [70].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 11 of 25\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 12 of 25\nTo investigate the temperature effect on the adsorption of Pb2+ and Ni2+ on the studied biomasses, the distribution coefficient, Kd (L/g), was calculated at temperatures of 303.15, 328.15, and 353.15 K using Equation (3).\nKd = qe Ce\n(3)\nThe Kd values obtained for the adsorption of Pb2+ and Ni2+ on the biomasses under study are presented in Table 6. The results indicate a decrease in Kd values as the temperature increased within the evaluated range (from 303.15 to 353.15 K), suggesting an exothermic adsorption of metals for all the bioadsorbents. The above is consistent with the results found for \u2206H\u25e6, also shown in Table 6. Similar results were found when using Celtek clay for the removal of Pb2+ and Cr3+, showing a decrease in Kd while the temperature rose from 303 to 323 K [71]. Zhang et al. [72] estimated the Kd of Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Cr3+ onto poly(acrylic acid)-grafted chitosan and biochar composites to establish the adsorbent\u2019s affinity for the adsorbate when working with multicomponent solutions.

Effect of the Time and Adsorption Kinetics The kinetics of the bioadsorption process are crucial aspects that determine the efficiency of heavy metal removal from wastewater [74]. Understanding the relationship between the time required for the adsorption process and the adsorption capacity is essential to optimizing the process. Moreover, it is necessary to study the kinetic models to determine the mechanisms involved in the adsorption process. These models provide insights into the controlling steps of the process, which can be useful in designing an efficient and cost-effective bioadsorption system [75]. The kinetic adsorption data in the present study were adjusted to pseudo-first order (PFO), pseudo-second order (PSO), Elovich, and intraparticle diffusion (ID).\nFrom Figure 6, it is evident that the equilibrium time is reached at 120 min for Pb2+ and Ni2+ when using any of the evaluated biomasses. In addition, a rapid rate of adsorption is observed in the initial minutes of contact between the solution and the adsorbent, which is attributed to the high availability of vacant adsorption sites in the initial stages of the process [76]. From Tables 6 and 7, it is observed that the PSO and Elovich models have the highest R2 and the lowest reduced Chi Square. The above refers to the proportionality between the rate of adsorption and the square of the number of unoccupied adsorp ion si es on the bent surfac , implying that the rate of adsorption decreases exponentially with increasing surface coverage [24].\nA kinetics study can contribute to the improvement of heavy metal removal by providing valuable insights into the rate at which the adsorption process occurs. By understanding the kinetics, the optimal contact time between the adsorbent and the metal ions can be determined for maximum removal efficiency. This information helps in designing efficient treatment systems and optimizing operational parameters such as adsorbent dosage and flow rate, and is a useful insight into the scaling up of the adsorption process [1]. Additionally, studying the kinetics allows for the identification of the rate-limiting step in the adsorption process, which can guide further research and development efforts to enhance the removal of heavy metals. Thus, the kinetic data fitting the PSO model implies a two-step adsorption process. The first step involves metal diffusion from the solution to the external surface of the adsorbent, explaining the initial rapid adsorption rate. The second step involves the intraparticle diffusion of the metal into the pores of the bioadsorbents [2]. With the Elovich and PSO models as the best fit, it is assumed that chemisorption is the mechanism controlling the process, and due to increasing surface coverage, the rate of adsorbate elimination decreases with time. The approaching equilibrium factor (RE) determined by the Elovich model is given by Equation (4):\nRE = 1\nqe \u00d7 \u03b2 (4)\nThe similar adjustment of the PFO, PSO, and Elovich models to the experimental data could be attributed to the fact that all the models consider that the rate of adsorption depends on the initial concentration and the adsorption capacity depends on the available\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 14 of 25\nadsorption sites and the affinity between adsorbate and adsorbent [77]. In addition, these empirical equations assume that the concentration of the adsorbate in the solution is constant (considering a chemical reaction where one of the reactant species is in excess, with an approximately constant concentration, it has no effect on the observed rate of the reaction); they also assume that the kinetics are based on the adsorption capacity of solids instead of the concentration in the liquid phase [78]. These assumptions of the evaluated models may lead to similar adjustments when data have a similar tendency. It is also observed from Figure 5 and Tables 7 and 8 that the intraparticle diffusion model does not describe the data, thus having the highest reduced Chi-Square values and R2 equal to zero in all cases. These results can be attributed to the complexity of the adsorption process and the tendencies of the data. For further studies, we will apply this and other diffusive models to different segments of the data before and after reaching equilibrium in the system. There have been reports that diffusional models that also consider the pore volume can accurately describe the kinetic adsorption data of different pollutants present in water [79,80]. The evaluation of RE parameters provides an idea about the characteristics and curvature of the associated Elovich adjustment. Thus, when RE is higher than 0.3, a gradual increase in the curve is observed, indicating a limited initial adsorption rate. For values between 0.1 and 0.3, a moderate increase in the curve is reported. When the value is between 0.02 and 0.1, a rapid rise in the curve is recorded. If the value is lower than 0.02, instant equilibrium is reached [81]. All the obtained values of RE were lower than 0.1, confirming the chemical nature of the system and implying strong binds between the metals and the adsorbent active centers. Regarding the qe parameter of the PFO and PSO models, they are consistent with the experimental data with a low deviation. The intraparticle diffusion model did not describe the adsorption data, showing a highly Reduced Chi-Square. This could be associated with the pore diffusion mechanism as the rate-controlling step. Similar results were reported when using amidoxime manna tree residues for removing lead, having a fast adsorption rate and reaching equilibrium at 45 min of contact time [26]. Furthermore, the pomegranate resulted in a good adsorbent of Pb2+ present in real wastewater; the kinetic data were fitted to the Elovich model with an R2 value greater than 0.9 and an SSE ranging from 0 to 0.002 in all cases [24]. Ni2+ adsorption kinetic data were also fitted by the Elovich and PSO models when using peat, compost, brown algae, sawdust, and wood ash [30], modified zeolite [82], and aloe vera [83].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 15 of 25\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 16 of 25\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 17 of 25"

Pb2+ and Ni2+ adsorption adjustment to non-linear isotherm models using (a) PP, (b) CCR, (c) CH, and (d) CP.\nThe fit to the Langmuir model indicates the formation of a monolayer during the adsorption process because the active centers are considered equal. Langmuir\u2019s separation factor (RL) expresses the favorable or unfavorable nature of the process: favorable and unfavorable adsorption are assumed when RL is between 0 and 1, and larger than 1, respectively. In addition, when RL is equal to 0 or 1, irreversible and linear adsorption, respectively, occur [86]. The adjustment to the Freundlich model shows multilayer adsorption due to the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent, where Freundlich\u2019s constant (KF) indicates the magnitude of the equilibrium adsorption rate. The parameter n is indicative of the heterogeneity of the adsorption sites; when n is higher than 1, the adsorption would depend on the distribution of the active centers, and if n is lower than 1, the process is controlled by chemisorption [87]. Redlich-Peterson is an empirical model, a result of the combination of Langmuir and Freundlich models, and assumes that the mechanism is not described by\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 18 of 25\na monolayer [88]. The Temkin model assumes the linear diminution of the affinity between adsorbate and adsorbent as time passes, and it is valid for an intermediate range of initial concentration [89]. From Figure 7, it is established that the adsorption capacity of the bioadsorbents increases with the initial concentration, which is related to the growth in the concentrationinduced driving force [90]. Considering the R2 and Reduced Chi-Square values reported in Table 8, it can be said that the Pb2+ equilibrium on PP is not well described by any evaluated model. Thus, it could be due to the complex interaction between the metal and the active centers of the biomass. This lack of adjustment could lead to the development of a generalized model based on the phenomenology of the adsorption process in a solid-liquid system. Temkin exhibited the best fit when using CCR as an adsorbent, which indicates that the controlling mechanism of the process is chemisorption by the binding between the Pb2+ and the available adsorption sites [90]. The equilibrium data of CH and CP are well described by the Freundlich model, assuming that the process is non-ideal because of the energy difference between the adsorbent sites and reversible with the formation of a multilayer. The parameter n is higher than 1 for PP and CCR, indicating that the adsorption of Pb2+ onto this biomass depends on the distribution of the active centers. When using CH and CP, the n is lower than 1, showing that the process is controlled by chemisorption [91]. From the value obtained for RL, it can be said that the adsorption of Pb2+ onto the four dry evaluated biomasses is favorable.\nRegarding Ni2+ adsorption, the Freundlich model describes the adsorption on CH, Langmuir on CCR and CP, and RP on PP. According to Freundlich\u2019s n parameter, the adsorption on CCR depends on the distribution of the active centers, while on PP, CP, and\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 19 of 25\nCH, the mechanism is controlled by chemisorption. From the value obtained for RL, it can be said that the adsorption of Ni2+ onto the CCR, CH, and CP is favorable.\nTable 10 shows the Langmuir parameter qmax data reported for removing Pb2+ and Ni2+ with adsorbents of different natures, finding that the results obtained in the present study are the average for bioadsorbents of lignocellulosic origin when removing Ni2+, while in the case of Pb2+, the results excel the other reported adsorbents in the literature.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4884 20 of 25"

            "text": "The adsorption mechanism plays a crucial role in the efficiency of heavy metal removal by bioadsorbents. Understanding the mechanism could help optimize the process and enhance the adsorption capacity. The mechanism is influenced by the intrinsic factors of the adsorbents as well as the properties of the pollutant [93]. In addition, studying the adsorption equilibrium and kinetics can help evaluate the adsorption capacity and predict the performance of the bioadsorbent under different conditions. Through the characterization shown in Chapter 3.1, the kinetic study in Chapter 3.5, and the isotherm adjustment in Chapter 3.6, it can be said that the adsorption of Pb2+ and Ni2+ onto the dry biomasses evaluated as bioadsorbents can be controlled by the following mechanisms: chelation, intra-molecular dispersion, dispersion of the ions from the bulk to the adsorbent surface, and intraparticle diffusion. Those mechanisms involve the existence of a driving force that allows the movement of the ions from the solution, the dispersion through the boundary to the surface of the adsorbent, the fixation in the available sites at the surface, and then the movement to the insight pores. Similar mechanisms were reported when using oximated manna in the removal of Pb2+ in batch systems [26]. For the removal of Ni2+ onto biochars from crops, weeds, and trees, the mechanism reported was chelation by the occurrence of redox reactions and the formation of bonds with H on the surface of the bioadsorbents [94]."

It exhibits a strong affinity for heavy metal removal and enables the recovery of metals from the adsorbent matrix. The study of isotherms and kinetics reveals that the sorption rate depends on the physical and chemical properties of the sorbent as well as parameters like pH, time, adsorbent dosage, and temperature. The removal rate of metal ions typically increases over time until equilibrium is reached between the solid and liquid phases. Recent literature suggests that adsorption technology is a superior alternative to traditional methods for extracting toxic metals. Furthermore, including more active functional groups on the adsorbent surface is essential to effectively remove a wide range of contaminants and maintain long-term mobility, meeting the requirements for practical wastewater treatment. To enhance toxin removal efficiency against diverse contaminants, dynamic compounds with high affinity have been utilized to modify the adsorbent surface. The study of the kinetics and equilibrium of adsorption is important for simulating the adsorption process in specialized software such as Aspen Adsorption and Unisim.

Results from the FTIR and SEM-EDX analyses confirm the presence of functional groups and the presence of the removed heavy metals on the adsorbent surface after the process. It was evidenced that electrostatic attraction, cation exchange, and surface complexation were the main mechanisms involved in the adsorption of metals onto the bioadsorbents. adsorbent dosage of 0.03 g, 30 \u25e6C, and a particle size of 0.325 mm. The removal efficiency of Pb2+ and Ni2+ increased with higher adsorbent dosage, with Pb2+ exhibiting greater biosorption capacity than Ni2+. The experimental isotherm of Pb2+ when using CH and CP is well described by the Freundlich model and Temkin for CCR. In the case of Ni2+, Freundlich describes the adsorption on CH, Langmuir on CCR and CP, and RP on PP. The kinetics were adjusted by PSO and Elovich models for both ions, with the adsorption rate following the order: CH > CP > CCR > PP for Pb2+ and CH > CCR > PP > CP for Ni2+. Similarly, the thermodynamic parameters are typical of an exothermic process, with low reversibility and spontaneity. It can be said that the adsorption mechanism is controlled by chemisorption and strong binding between the adsorbent and heavy metal. These findings suggest that the dry raw biomasses of plantain peels, corn cob residues, cocoa husk, and cassava peels can effectively remove lead and nickel, but further research is needed to explore their application in industrial-scale and continuous systems, which can be done by using computational tools like artificial neural networks, machine learning, and software such as Aspen Adsorption, HYSYS, or UniSim.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ma16134884/s1, Figure S1.
