            "text": "The Ethereum blockchain began operation on July 30, 2015. For more than seven years, the chain was secured by a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol. This entailed large clusters of specialized computers, known as mining networks, competing with one another to find a random number called the nonce. The first miner to show that the hash of the nonce was below the network\u2019s difficulty level would be allowed to add the new block to the chain. The miner would receive a block reward and collect gas fees for the transactions included in the block. As the network difficulty increased, the energy resources consumed by the miners grew ever larger.\nOn August 13, 2022, the electricity consumption of the network, using the methodology of de Vries (2018), reached a peak, annualized at 93.975 Terra Watt Hours per year.1 For context, this exceeds the usage by the Phillipines.2\nVitalik Buterin, founder of the network, had advocated for a transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) as early as 2016.3 This validation method requires stakers to verify new transactions. Instead of searching randomly for the nonce, stakers place their Ethereum holdings into a smart contract as collateral. If stakers fail to fulfill their validation responsibilities\u2013 accidentally or maliciously\u2013they can be punished by losing their staked coins. Stakers for\n1An alternative, more conservative methodology is used by Krause and Tolaymat (2018). 2https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of countries by electricity consumption 3https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51\nany given block are chosen via a pseudo-random algorithm known as RANDAO.4 Edgington (2022) provides a more comprehensive discussion about RANDAO, and Park et al. (2020) contains details on Ethereum\u2019s implementation of PoS.\nSince PoS forgoes the energy-intensive problem solving characteristic of proof-of-work, the Ethereum transition to PoS has cut the electricity usage of the network to 0.015 Terra Watts, a 99.98% decrease, as seen in Figure 1.\nThe last block mined under PoW5 was 15537393 by F2 Pool Old at 6:42:42 AM GMT on September 15, 2022. It included only one ERC-721 (NFT) transaction. The first PoS block6 15537394 was a normal sized block7 with 80 transactions, but it included a 45 Ether (ETH) priority fee (tip) We will drop the transition day, September 15, in most of our analysis, analyzing one month event windows around that date."

            "text": "Prior to the merge, blocks were added by the miners. For the period August 14 to September 14, 2022, we computed the number of blocks and associated transactions that each miner completed. The top 10 miners, by blocks completed, are in Table 1. The Herfindahl index for the top ten is 1,245. Ethermine has the largest market share at 28.6%.\nBlocks are now secured by validators, participants in the Ethereum 2.0 consensus algorithm who have placed at least 32 ETH into the deposit contract12 shown in Figure 3. A committee of at least 128 validators, selected by RANDAO, are chosen to add a block for any given slot. One participant, called the block proposer, forms the block, a process that entails selecting and verifying a set of transactions has no failures or errors. The block then needs to be confirmed by the remaining validators, called attesters, who check and give their vote of confidence to the block. Finality is achieved at the checkpoint block, the first block in the next epoch, with support from 2/3 of the staked ETH.13\nThe randomness of selection means that validators must have an active system nearly 24/7; they can have some or all of their stake burned14 and be removed (slashed) from the set of validators, for failing to complete an assigned task. As of November 1, 2022, 217 validators have been slashed,15 24 since the merge.\n12https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa 13https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/finality 14A term used to describe ETH that is cut loose from the network and is thus unacessible to any user. 15https://beaconcha.in/validators/slashings\nIn order to incentivize ETH holders to stake in the network, validators are compensated in two ways. The block proposer claims the gas fees, net of burning. Validators also receive rewards for attesting to and finalizing blocks.16 This reward is a function of the total network stake, with the return inversely proportional to the square root of the number of validators.\nPintail (2021) provides estimates of the returns to staking Ethereum on the Beacon Chain which draws on the Ethereum 2.0 annotated specification of Edgington (2022). With 401,084\n16https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/\nvalidators on the merge day, this model estimates a return of 1.49 ETH over the year, an annualized yield of 4.64%. If the number of validators were to double, the return would fall to 1.05 ETH or just 3.28%.\nWe computed the number of blocks and transactions that each validator proposed from September 16 to October 16, 2022. The top 10 validators by blocks completed can be seen in Table 2. The Herfindahl index for the top 10 is 1,009; the network is 19% less concentrated after the merge.\nMoreover, there is no overlap between the pre-merge miners and the post-merge validators. Miners\u2019 comparative advantage is their computing power, but this does not give a meaningful leg-up for PoS validation. Some miners have migrated to other networks that are still using PoW. In fact, the reward for mining an Ethereum Classic or RVN blocks, which still use PoW, dropped roughly 84% and 97%, respectively, within a 24-hour period around the merge.17\nThe dominant validators are Flashbots, a research collective designed to mitigate the problem of maximum extractable value (MEV), a measure of the profit a network participant can make through \u201ctheir ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions from the blocks they produce.\u201d18 In other words, since there is no formal regulation around the order of transactions in a block, or which transactions are included in a block, validators could choose to prioritize certain types of transactions, giving those parties systemic advantages when trading. In the proof of stake regime, Flashbots has released MEV-Boost, an opensource algorithm which sells blockspace to an open market of builders. On September 15, 2022, 17 epochs after the merge, MEV-Boost was activated.\nBioXroute19 and MEV Builder utilize MEV-Boost.20 The four Flashbots addresses have\nvalidated 46.6% of the blocks in the month since the merge.\n17https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/15/ethereum-miners-are-quickly-dying-less-than-24-ho urs-after-the-merge/\n18https://www.flashbots.net/ 19https://docs.bloxroute.com/apis/mev-solution/mev-relay-for-validators 20builder 0x69 utilizes two relays, Flashbots and Relayooor, https://medium.com/@builder0x69\nWhile it may not be computationally intensive, validating requires a large capital commitment, a great deal of technical knowledge, and a round-the-clock connection to the network. There are, however, on- and off-chain methods for retail investors, who would otherwise be locked out due to these stringent demands, to become validators. Validation pools, such as Lido, have been a popular on-chain method of staking\u2013in fact, as seen in Table 2, Lido is the dominant staking pool in the market. Users pool their resources into Lido by purchasing its staking token, stETH.21 Lido then invests the pooled assets into the staking contract, and distributes the rewards amongst the investors.\nThere are also off-chain solutions for retail staking, namely through centralized exchanges. As seen on Table 2, Coinbase is the second largest staker in part due to a service that mirrors Lido\u2019s on-chain pooling; Coinbase users can offer any amount of ETH to be pooled and staked in the deposit contract. Other centralized exchanges, like Binance, offer similar services; Kraken offered such a service for the duration of this sample, but have since shut down user stalking pools. Since daily issuance of new ETH to the validators is a function of the total amount of ETH staked, tracking the dominant validators may be important insofar as understanding the growth in ETH supply.\nValidators can\u2019t withdraw ETH from the staking contract until the Shanghai upgrade. At the time of the Merge, it was anticipated that the upgrade would take six to eighteen months, and it is now on pace for the lower end of that range, March 2023.22\n21The hash on the Ethereum Mainnet is 0xae7ab96520de3a18e5e111b5eaab095312d7fe84. 22https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-27/crypto-s-hottest-trade-risks-spurring-another-\nleverage-bubble#xj4y7vzkg"

            "text": "Historically, income for miners has come from two sources: block rewards for completing a new block on the chain and transaction fees from on-chain transfers. Since August 2021, after the EIP-1559 upgrade,23 base fees from transfers have been burned. A miner\u2019s block income, prior to the merge, consisted of these three parts shown in (1):\nBlock Income = Block Reward + Transaction Fees - Burnt Gas (1)\nBlock reward is the number of new ETH minted and given to the party responsible for successfully adding a block to the chain; transaction fees, include the gas, both base and priority fees, from the transactions in the block; burnt gas for each transaction is the base fee in ETH set by the network protocol.\nSince the St. Petersburg upgrade in 2019, miners received two ETH for each block they completed. However, the transition to PoS removed this reward altogether. Miner and validators\u2019 total block income before and after the event is plotted in Figure 6.\nTable 3 decomposes the decline in block income. There is a slight, statistically insignificant rise in transaction fees for transfers, but it is largely offset by a higher burn rate. The loss of a block completion bonus is the main drag on block income. Validators\u2019 total block income is now only 3% of what miners used to earn.\n23https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/eip-1559-faq\nThe removal of the block completion reward has also greatly slowed the minting of new ETH. Since the St. Petersburg Upgrade,24 two new ETH were minted as a reward for each completed block; this served as the main driver of ETH supply expansion. Combined with a smaller issuance for ommer blocks25 and validators on the Beacon Chain,26 there was about 5.5 million new ETH minted annually.27 Since the merge, the two ETH per transaction reward on the execution layer (PoW) are no longer being produced. There is now roughly 1,600 new ETH minted each day, which is distributed to the validators in the network. The burn rate can, in principal, exceed the issuance rate, resulting in blocks that deflate total ETH supply. Finally, ETH continues to be staked, removing it from the circulating supply.\n24The updates went live at block 7,280,000 on February 28, 2019: https://cointelegraph.com/news/ether eums-constantinople-st-petersburg-upgrades-have-been-activated\n25https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/ommer 26https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/beacon-chain/ 27https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/\nFigure 7: Ethereum Supply\nNote: The sample is from August 14 to October 16, 2022.

The dollar price of the transaction can vary quite widely because: (1) the ETH price of a unit of gas deviates with network congestion and (2) the dollar price of ETH, until recently, was increasing steadily.\nThe median fee in Figure 8 peaked at over $28 on May 11, 2021. Following a temporary dip, prices remained over $10 through November 2021, but have fallen since. Going into the merge, the median price was $0.502.\nAs seen in Table 4, gas price and gas used for ETH transactions have seen statistically significant increases since the merge.

Except on the rare occasions that a block is skipped, validators produce a new block every twelve seconds. Given this faster speed, transactions per day are up by 75,000 on average.\nIn fact, as seen in Figure 11, there were only 32.5 blocks per day, on average, that were not created exactly 12 seconds after the preceding block. All these blocks were created 24 seconds afterwards. This consistency occurs by design: blocks are now added by chosen\nvalidators into specific slots, each 12 seconds apart. The only reason why slots are \u201cskipped,\u201d is due to a failed block creation.\nIncreased and more stable block formation speed could allow for more on-chain activity. In theory, there seems to be nothing preventing an even faster rate. That said, there may be an optimal balance between block creation speed and the number of transactions per block, although lower latency networks, such as Solana, provide much higher transaction volumes."

We summarize our findings in Table 13. Declining prices for the utility tokens lower network fees in USD, except for Matic transactions on Polygon.\nAs summarized in Table 14, the speed of activity rose slightly on Ethereum and fell slightly on Polygon. Solana has slowed by almost 50% which may be attributable to major network outages on September 30 and October 1, 2022.31\n31https://status.solana.com/uptime?page=2\nThe transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake has also reshaped the entire Ethereum landscape. The composition of block creators has entirely changed; there is not one miner from the PoW regime that is now proposing or attesting to blocks as a validator under the PoS regime. While gas transaction fees for network participants have grown since the merge, so has the amount of ETH burned. Block rewards were many times larger than the daily variable sum, distributed to the validators. Because of the loss of block rewards, increased burn rates, and more staked Ether, the total circulating supply is now deflationary.\nThere are many open questions remaining. What will be the long run return to staking? Two ongoing factors are: when will validators finally be able to withdraw stalked ETH;32 216 validators have already been slashed for improper actions as validators;33 how attractive will this investment be in the long run?\nWill decentralized staking systems like Lido dominate centralized exchanges like Coinbase? Will Ethereum gas fees eventually fall given the reduction in energy needed to secure the network? Will other proof-of-work networks look to transition to proof-of-stake or other less energy intensive models of block formation? Finally, will sharding, which effectively makes individual nodes into their separate blockchains,34 enable Ethereum to achieve latencies and fees similar to Solana?\nLastly, major policy questions are still unresolved in the digital asset space. Specifically, Chairman Gensler of the SEC has suggested that staking may qualify certain blockchains as securities, as per the Howey Test,35 though Ethereum is currently classified as a commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).36 Kraken has recently discontinued its Staking-As-A-Service program as part of a $30 million settlement with the SEC.37 Gensler has made it clear38 that centralized exchanges are not \u201cqualified custodians,\u201d so this action\n32https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-14/-illiquidity-risk-is-a-side-effect-of-ethereum-c rypto-upgrade\n33https://www.blocknative.com/blog/an-ethereum-stakers-guide-to-slashing-other-penalties 34https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/sharding/. It is projected to arrive sometime in 2023. 35Paul Kiernan and Vicky Ge Huang, Ether\u2019s New \u2018Staking\u2019 Model Could Draw SEC Attention. Wall Street Journal, September 16, 2022. 36The CFTC asserts this in their filing again Sam Bankman-Fried: \u201dA digital asset is anything that can be stored and transmitted electronically and has associated ownership or use rights.
