By applying rapid sequencing technology based 45 on nanopores, we sequenced long pieces of genomic DNA and successfully detected fusion 46 genes in cell lines and primary specimens (e.g., BCR-ABL1, PML-RARA, CBFB-MYH11, KMT2A-47 AF4) using cloud-based bioinformatics workflows with novel custom fusion finder software. We 48 detected fusion genes in 100% of cell lines with the expected breakpoints and confirmed the 49 presence or absence of a recurrent fusion gene in 12 of 14 patient cases. With our optimized 50 assay and cloud-based bioinformatics workflow, these assays and analyses could be performed 51 in under 8 hours. 52 53 Introduction 54 Current classification of myeloid malignancies is largely based on the molecular and genetic 55 aberrations 1,2. Recurrent gene rearrangements are present in 30-40% of acute myeloid 56 leukemias (AML), and well described driver fusions that in some cases suffice to diagnose 57 leukemias with PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, etc. even when the blast percentage is below 58 20%1. Recurrent fusion genes confer certain clinical and biological characteristics as drivers of 59 leukemogenesis, and their identification assists in prognosis stratification and inform treatment 60 decisions. Identification of driver fusion genes is especially relevant when targeted therapies 61 are available. Examples include tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in chronic myelogenous leukemia 62 (CML)3 that bind to the kinase domain in ABL1 deregulated as a consequence of the fusion with 63 BCR, and differentiation therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in which identification 64 of the promyelocytic leukemia- retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA) fusion confirms the 65\nAll rights reserved.

Clinical molecular assays for BCR-ABL1 and PML-RARA primarily target RNA 73 transcripts by RT-PCR because of the greater abundance of fusion gene transcripts compared to 74 the DNA copies per cell, and because of the large variability in the genomic sequence of the 75 fusion that can encompass large intronic region making routine DNA PCR impossible (e.g., BCR-76 ABL). 77 78 Typical NGS reads are 150 to 250 bps in length which are not sufficiently long enough to extend 79 over DNA fragments that are adjoined because of a large genomic aberration thus hindering 80 both alignment and detection of large indels and other structural abnormalities. NGS is limited 81 by short read assembly mis-mapping, and amplification strategies instill imperfect quantitation 82 of the variant allele frequencies. The diversity of aberrations in myeloid neoplasms include 83 large genomic aberrations, including insertions and deletions, loss of heterozygosity, single 84 nucleotide polymorphism, mutations in homopolymer rich regions and highly repetitive regions 85 such as internal tandem duplications, that are difficult to detect by NGS and require different 86 assays in molecular and cytogenetics labs additionally to those used to confirm fusion genes. 87\nAll rights reserved.

Additionally, the portability 99 and affordability of the Nanopore sequencer MinION and Flongle, hold great promise to impact 100 the clinical field. However, a major limitation has been the lack of analytical software featuring 101 standardized parameters to aid in translation into clinical diagnostics. 102 103 Here we report our success in developing an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas9 targeted 104 enrichment sequencing protocol using Nanopore MinION and Flongles to detect fusions 105 relevant in the diagnosis and classification of CML and AMLs.

In addition to this amplification-free CRISPR-Cas9 nanopore assay, we 112 extended our previously developed cloud-based nanopore data analysis pipeline 13 to include 113 fusion detection and develop a custom breakpoint detection tool (see Figure 1). Using our 114 optimized assay and our custom breakpoint finder, we showed that we can reliably detect and 115 confirm fusion breakpoints in 80% of our specimens in under 3 hours of sequencing and data 116 analysis. 117 118 Methods: 119 Cells lines and patient samples 120 Our assay was optimized using 6 cell lines: three with the BCR-ABL1 fusion (K562, KU812, and 121 KCL22), and NB4, MV4;11 and ME-1 that bear the PML-RARA, KMT2A-AF4, and MYH11-CBFB 122 fusions respectively. Residual mononuclear cells from primary specimens (6 specimens from 5 123 patients with CML, 6 specimens from 5 patients with suspected APL, and 2 acute myeloid 124 leukemia, not acute promyelocytic leukemia) were isolated using Ficoll\u00ae reagent (Millipore-125 Sigma) and banked in liquid nitrogen until the time of the experiment. All specimens had been 126 originally tested in a CLIA certified laboratory according to standard clinical protocols.14 IRB 127 coverage was obtained for use of residual laboratory samples.

Special caution, including use of wide 135 bore pipette tips and moderate centrifuge spin velocity was exercised to minimize fragmenting 136 DNA strands. Two DNA specimens were extracted with AllPrep DNA/RNA Kit (Qiagen, 137 Germantown, MD, USA), and one with QiAgen X-tractor with Reagent Pack DX (Qiagen, 138 Germantown, MD, USA). cRNA guides were designed to direct Cas9 to cut on genomic proximity 139 of each of the regions involved in each one of the translocations studied. When the target 140 region was big, guides were tiled across the region to maximize coverage. Guides were 141 designed to capture PML-RARA, BCR-ABL1 p210, KMT2A-AF4, and MYH11-CBFB, including 142 different fusion isoforms. Guides were designed using Chopchop 143 (https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no/) with the CRISPR-Cas9 and nanopore enrichment settings and 144 previously described 15. 145 146 We used 5 micrograms of DNA as input for each cell line and 2 to 5 micrograms for primary 147 specimens. Average DNA integrity number (DIN) was 9.2 (range: 7.5-9.8). Figure 1 shows a 148 schematic of our workflow and details of the library prep are published15.

In contrast to the NanoFG workflow 172 from Stangle et al17, our platform includes the computationally intensive base calling step, an 173 interactive graphical user interface, and can readily leverage GPUs and be deployed on the 174 cloud.

Specifically, we extended the Biodepot-workflow-builder (Bwb)18 platform in which 176 each computational task (or module) is represented by a graphical widget that calls a software 177 container in the back end. Software containers, such as Docker, include all software 178 dependencies and libraries required to execute the code. We have recently developed a Bwb 179 workflow13 to support the processing of Nanopore data that includes the use of base callers 180 Guppy19 and Bonito19, alignment using minimap2 and visualization of results using the 181 Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) and GRCh37 hg19 as reference genome QC data was 182 generated with PycoQC20. Guppy was used as the base caller. Minimap221 was used as the 183 aligner and variant caller. Fusions are visualized on IGV22 and confirmed on Blast. Most 184 importantly, we extend our previous work by adding support for fusion detection, including 185 LongGF23 and our own custom software \u201cBiodepot Fusion Finder\u201d (BFF). 186 187 Bioinformatics pipeline for fusion detection: LongGF 188 LongGF23 is a software tool for fusion detection optimized for the high base calling error rates 189 and alignment errors commonly found in long read sequencing data. LongGF takes as input a 190 BAM file containing alignments (generated by minimap2 in this pipeline) and a GTF file 191 containing the definitions of known genes. The output is a log file with detected gene fusions 192 and their supporting reads. We created a graphical widget for LongGF in the Bwb. Figure 2 193 shows a screenshot of the comparative workflows with output for LongGF versus BFF. 194 195 Custom fusion detection tool: Biodepot Fusion Finder (BFF) 196 Reads that span a fusion gene will align to coordinates in both parts of the fusion and provide a 197 specific breakpoint coordinate.

This is similar to the strategy used 200 by LongGF except that we allow for errors in the alignment near the breakpoint. Accordingly, 201 the Breakpoint Finder identifies fusions that are not detected by LongGF which looks for 202 supporting reads where the breakpoints are exactly matched. The user can provide a panel of 203 breakpoint coordinates of interest. If no panel is provided, BFF will return candidate fusions 204 that span nonadjacent genomic regions. Incomplete coordinates for breakpoints in the panel 205 are supported \u2013 the user does not need to define the exact coordinates, nor do both 206 breakpoints need to be given. BFF will return all the reads that match the panel of breakpoints 207 in a text file for further inspection by the user if desired. The user can also provide a file with 208 guide coordinates to obtain additional enrichment metrics. A containerized widget was 209 developed that can integrated with the Bwb workflows for processing nanopore data. Using 210 these workflows, we can directly analyze raw nanopore data and obtain lists of candidate 211 fusions. 212 213 Benchmarking experiments 214 We performed empirical experiments to benchmark the sensitivity and runtime required to 215 reliably detect fusion. For each individual sample, sequencing metrics including quality scores 216 and timestamps are obtained from the sequencing summary text file obtained as an output of 217 base calling using Guppy. Detected fusions are then acquired from the Breakpoint Finder as 218 well as LongGF. Specific fusion breakpoints are also provided in the data set from the BFF. All 219 samples are then combined into a dictionary and separated by patient and cell line data. Plots 220\nAll rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Finally, the total number of fusion reads 222 detected for each sample is compared between the BFF and LongGF as shown in Figure 2. 223 224 Enrichment assessment 225 Two enrichment metrics were computed by BFF and tracked for each sample. First is the fusion-226 specific enrichment which is calculated with the following formula [(number of fusion reads) / 227 (mean coverage of the genome)]. Second is the on-target enrichment which is calculated with 228 the following formula [(number of reads that originate from a guide RNA cut point that includes 229 the region of the breakpoint)/(mean genome coverage)]. Reads originating from a guide RNA 230 cut are distinguished by the guide sequence being at the beginning of a read. As initial electrical 231 signal data is generated by DNA passing through the nanopores (reads at the beginning of a 232 strand) are error prone, which affects base calling and therefore the alignment of the reads so 233 that the start sequence is often misaligned. Consequently, the BFF considers base pairs of the 234 sequence near the start (default within 50 bp) of a read that aligns near the coordinates of a 235 guide RNA cut site to have originated from a guide RNA cut. Specific reads cut by guides are 236 manually confirmed. The allowed error intervals are customizable. SamTools v1.13 is used to 237 sort and convert BAM files and determine the overall average coverage24.

A range of 243 0.04 Gb \u2013 5.47 gigabases of sequencing data was generated for each sample for an average 244 mean coverage of the human genome of 0.32-fold (range: 0.01 \u2013 1.66). We adopted standard 245 quality metrics for nanopore workflows and tracked N50, which is a quality metric where half 246 the reads are above this length (range 4.65kb-32.2kb) and median read length for total reads 247 (range 0.87kb- 9.60kb). Percentage of reads aligned ranged from 72 - 96%. Fusion specific 248 enrichment was 135 - 837 fold for cell lines and 6 - 509 fold for patient samples. On target 249 enrichment was 849 - 5830 fold for cell lines and 535 - 3007 fold for patient samples. 250 251 Concordance of fusion detection with clinical results: 252 Concordance with expected results was 100% for cell lines as the expected fusion was detected 253 in 6/6 cell lines (3 BCR-ABL1, 1 PML-RARA, 1 MYH11-CBFB, 1 KMT2A-AFF1). Breakpoint 254 sequences detected for BCR-ABL1 cell lines are the same as previously published 26. We 255 correctly confirmed the presence or absence of fusions in 11/14 (78.5%) primary specimens 256 including both diagnostic and measurable residual disease (MRD) cases with a minimum of 257 three reads, however one case (APL6) showed only 2 fusion reads and was not counted as 258 confirmed. The 3 missed cases (CML3, APL1, and APL6 in tables 1 and 2) were comprised of low 259 disease burden, ~0%, 1% and <5%. We detected BCR-ABL1 in 5/6 cases, PML-RARA in 2/6 cases, 260 KMT2A-AF9 and CBFB-MYH11 in 1/1 case each. BCR-ABL1 genomic breakpoint was confirmed 261 by Sanger sequencing in CML1 and CML2 after designing patient specific primers. 262 263\nAll rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Clinical and laboratory details are listed in Table 2. For the first patient, 265 two specimens, one bone marrow and one peripheral blood (APL4 and APL 5) yielded no PML-266 RARA fusion reads. This patient presented with an AML morphologically suggestive of APL and 267 an isochromosome 17q without t(15;17) detected by karyotype. While fusion detection 268 software did not detect a fusion, manual inspection showed an insertion in an intronic region of 269 RARA with TTMV viral genome; this case was previously reported15. Patient APL6 (presented 270 with 22% blasts on flow in a <5% marrow which on unblinding showed a complex karyotype 271 with t(11;17)(q23;q25) including the KMT2A gene. Two reads with KMT2A-SEPT9 fusion were 272 detected in a suboptimal but acceptable run (N50 < 5000bp; on-target enrichment 650.66 fold), 273 confirming the lack of t(15;17) or PML-RARA fusion but the threshold was below the requisite 3 274 reads to confirm the KMT2A-SEPT9 fusion. 275 276 Comparison of fusion detection tools: 277 A comparison of the bioinformatic workflows for data analysis using different fusion detection 278 widgets including LongGF vs Biodepot Fusion Finder (BFF) was conducted; the specific workflow 279 is demonstrated in Figure 2. Additionally, BFF computes the fusion enrichment and on target 280 enrichment statistics; these are summarized in Table 2. In most cell line and primary specimens, 281 LongGF shows a particular challenge in the detection of BCR-ABL1 and does not detect all fusion 282 reads that are identified by BFF. Using the BFF, the average sequencing, and data processing 283 time to 3 reads with fusions in the cell line experiments was 42.75 minutes (range: 18.87 - 77.65 284 min) and 188 minutes in the primary specimens where 3 reads were detected (range: 32 - 654 285\nAll rights reserved.

Cell line experiments took an average of 11,711 286 reads to identify 3 fusion reads (range: 1,321 \u2013 43,326 reads) and 10,273 reads in primary 287 specimens (range: 1,790 - 24,999 reads) for confirmation of the fusion calls. 288 289 Comparison of Flongles and flow cells: 290 In five of our experiments (2 cell lines, 3 primary specimens), we used Flongles, while in the rest 291 we used Flow Cells. The performance of the affordable Flongles was inferior to the Flow Cells, 292 with lower expected average data output from the Flongles (based on manufacture 293 expectations of ~3GB), the N50 and median read length were smaller in Flongle reads (21,614 294 vs 19,166 and 6058 vs 5250 respectively), and significantly, the median Phred score for Flongle 295 reads being lower than that for the Flow Cells (9.2 vs 11.88). Despite the worse performance of 296 the Flongles, fusions were detected in 2 of 2 cell lines, and 2 of the 3 experiments with primary 297 specimens with at least 8 and 14 reads confirming the fusion and the specimen without fusion 298 confirmation was CML3 with pancytopenia and low disease burden. 299 300 Discussion 301 We developed a rapid assay to detect fusion genes in blood or marrow samples in less than 8 302 hours with the fastest time achieving 3 fusion reads was 5 hours. This was accomplished by 303 combining CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment during library preparation, nanopore long-read sequencing, 304 a cloud-based data analytic pipeline, with a novel BFF program developed and optimized for 305 finding fusions reads and breakpoints.

Our modular and containerized pipeline in Bwb allows users to 308 efficiently process raw FAST5 data on the cloud through an accessible graphical user interface 309 allowing for a very fast analysis step (average ~4.5 minutes for basecalling, alignment, and 310 fusion detection). To improve fusion calling, we developed the custom BFF that allow users to 311 identify fusion reads not detected by LongGF. We successfully confirmed published genomic 312 breakpoints in our series of cell lines and archival patient samples, which includes both 313 diagnostic and follow-up samples to test feasibility in confirming both common and novel 314 fusions over a range of tumor burdens. Our study includes 14 patient specimens and 315 demonstrates the usability of this method in primary specimens with 2microgram of DNA. 316 317 An advantage of the CRISRP-Cas9 based enrichment protocol is that it allows for targeting of 318 multiple common leukemia fusion genes by pooling multiple guide RNAs. Fusions are 319 particularly well suited for this method as they have large gene segments that aid in alignment 320 despite sequencing errors and wide variation where translocation breakpoints may occur. 321 Other labs have employed similar but different methods that detected fusions by targeting one 322 partner gene in the fusion 17. In contrast, our assay targets both partners of the fusion thus our 323 approach allows for an expanded capability to detect known and novel fusions, such as in case 324 AML1 with t(9;11), when guides are designed to target t(4;11). However, in 2/14 patients the 325 assay did not detect fusion genes because both cases had a very low amount of fusion target. In 326 one case (CML3) because the BCR-ABL1 was <0.01%, the other in the context of a very 327 hypocellular sample. 328 329\nAll rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

This has potential clinical utility for personalized disease monitoring 334 when CML patients are on TKI therapy and suppressing RNA transcription27; targeting DNA as a 335 monitoring target may be more robust and reproducible since DNA is stable and present in 336 constant numbers28. However genomic breakpoints in BCR-ABL1 are unique to individual 337 patients requiring patient-specific breakpoint characterization28-32 as ABL1 breakpoints occur 338 over an expansive region of about 150Kb, making this is an arduous endeavor previously 339 involving multiple primer sets and Sanger sequencing33. Our method allows a single approach 340 spanning the BCR and ABL1 breakpoint regions without the use of multiple primers and PCR 341 reactions. The sensitivity of DNA-based qPCR once the breakpoint is known can be as low as 10-342 7 34-35. Specimens CML1 and CML5 are a BM and PB obtained from the same patient and 343 demonstrate high fidelity in confirming genomic breakpoints and the ability to use patient 344 specific primers for personalized MRD monitoring. 345 346 Advantages of long-read sequencing over current clinical diagnostic assays are speed and the 347 relatively low complexity of the assay when compared to cytogenetics and targeted NGS 348 panels. While long-read sequencing results could potentially have a turnaround time (TAT) of 349 less than 24 hours, full karyotype analysis TAT is generally longer with the fastest times at days 350 to a week and most targeted NGS panels require ~7-10 days from start of processing to result 351\nAll rights reserved.

The nanopore sequencing streams data simultaneously to our GPU-enabled data 352 analytic pipeline in the Bwb interface which resides on the cloud to help interpret and reliably 353 identify fusion reads within 5000 seconds(<2 hours) computational time in most specimens. 354 Building on our experience14,17, we used 3 reads as a threshold for fusion confirmations. With 355 current simultaneous sequencing and data analysis workflow described here, 3 sequences are 356 detected in an average of 3 hours and 7 min (fastest at 30 min) in the 9 patient specimens 357 where a fusion could be confirmed. This means that a diagnostic result with a precise fusion 358 breakpoint with 3 fusion supporting reads would be possible in the same day. 359 360 Five specimens were sequenced on the less costly Flongle device, which has lower sequencing 361 capabilities (pore count ~60, sequencing life 24h), but 3 fusion reads were reached in 4/5 362 specimens (2 cell lines, 3 patient samples) with less resources. The sequencing quality is 363 significantly lower on the Flongles (median Phred 9.2 in Flongles vs 11.9 in Flow Cells), however 364 fusions were detected in all samples with adequate tumor burden. To achieve a cheaper 365 version of our fast and portable nanopore fusion assay, further challenges will need to be 366 addressed. We predict overall less sequencing can be achieved, even with additional 367 optimizations of the CRISPR library guides as multiplexing of the guide RNA appears to increase 368 efficiency and on-target fusion reads. Nanopores on the Flongles have poorer viability and 369 generate more read errors demonstrable by lower Flongle Phred quality on average and 370 therefore additional alignment challenges and a study of errors specific in Flongle bioinformatic 371 data compared to the flow cells are needed to understand potential compensation mechanisms 372 for data analysis. 373\nAll rights reserved.

Inherent characteristics of 377 fusions make this assay a promising cost effective tool for rapid detection of recurrent fusions 378 that 1) does not require previous knowledge of the target, , 2) with a rapid TAT (8 hours in 80% 379 of samples) when multiplexing different assays and used with the specific data analysis and 380 fusion detection tools described in our manuscript, 3) can precisely map translocation genomic 381 breakpoints that allow for development of personalized markers for disease monitoring, and 4 382 ) can potentially allow discovery of novel/different fusion partners 383 384 Contributions: OST and CY designed the study and performed background research and 385 secured IRB protocol.

Chemistry and bioinformatics workflow of rapid single molecule long-read 504 sequencing. 505\nGenomic DNA may contain a target fusion gene. The CRISPR-Cas9 system binds via 506 specific guideRNA (gRNA) designed to enrich for DNA containing regions of interests. The library 507 preparation does not undergo any amplification, and simply requires dA tailing and adapter 508 ligation and a clean-up prior to being loaded onto a sequencing flow cell. On the flow cell 509 libraries are sequenced by nanopores. Data from the sequencing devices are streamed 510 onto biodepot workflow builder and are analyzed starting from FAST5 files, through an initial 511 quality control, then base calling and alignment. After alignment different fusion finder tools 512 were tested including LongGF and BFF before visualizing on IgV for confirmation and 513 interpretation. 514 515\nFigure 2.
