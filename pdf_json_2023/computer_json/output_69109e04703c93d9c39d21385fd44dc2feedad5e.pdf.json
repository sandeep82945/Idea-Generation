            "text": "Hybrid metagenomic assembly, leveraging both long- and short-read 2 sequencing technologies, of microbial communities is becoming an increasingly 3 accessible approach yet offers challenges that existing benchmarks and 4 pipelines do not comprehensively handle well. One specific methodological 5 knowledge gap is selecting the ideal number of iterations of long read correction 6 and/or short read polishing, and in particular which the features of an assembly 7 to examine to empirically determine them. To account for biological and 8 technological variation, in this study the microbial communities of two 9 laboratory-scale bioreactors were sequenced with both short and long read 10 platforms and assembled with two different, commonly used software 11 packages. Following assembly, long read error correction was iterated ten 12 times, with subsequent ten rounds of short read polishing after common (0 and 13 2) and extensive (5 and 10) correction iterations. Several assembly 14 characteristics were tracked for each assembly and iteration of correction and 15 polishing: gene fragmentation, short read recruitment, automated binning 16 yields, as well as observed beta-diversity. While long read correction was 17 necessary, the greatest improvements occurred within the first few iterations of 18 short read polishing, and extensive correction and polishing did not tangibly 19 improve assembly quality. Furthermore, essentially all tracked characteristics 20 followed the same patterns; simpler statistics can serve as decent proxies for 21 more complex analyses to save computational resources assessing assembly 22 quality. Hybrid sequencing approaches will likely remain relevant due to the low 23 costs of short read sequencing, therefore it is imperative users are equipped to 24 estimate assembly quality prior to downstream gene- and genome-centric 25 analyses. 26 27 Background/Introduction 28 Though the increasing variety of high-throughput short- and long-read 29 (meta)genomic sequencing technologies are only within their first decades of 30 existence, both the sequencing technologies and software development have 31 flourished and been implemented to study microbial ecosystems1\u20133. Hybrid 32 sequencing integrating both short- and long-read platforms for single 33 microorganisms or microbial communities is becoming increasingly popular4 34\nbecause they compensate for the other\u2019s weaknesses \u2013 shorter reads achieve 35 higher accuracy while longer reads offer better contiguity. Despite the technical 36 costs decreasing and technologies improving, hybrid strategies currently are 37 cost-effective for recovering high-quality Metagenome-Assembled Genomes 38 (MAGs) from microbial communities5. However, many challenges remain that 39 may deter users from seeking relatively complicated approaches like hybrid 40 (meta)genomic sequencing of microorganisms and complex communities. 41 Hybrid (meta)genomic assembly typically requires iterative steps to 42 resolve various issues derived from sequencing errors, but in the absence of 43 \u201cgold standard\u201d reference genomes for less well-studied microbial consortia, 44 communities, or ecosystems, the determinants of a high-quality assembly are 45 unclear. Applying published methods may not be suitable for disparate 46 ecosystems, and common community guidance of \u201ctwo iterations of two tools\u201d 47 likely oversimplifies the needs of uncertain users. Therefore, reliable metrics to 48 determine the ideal approach to hybrid metagenomic assembly, correction, and 49 polishing is imperative. Many genome and assembly quality algorithms rely on 50 comparison to high-quality references, e.g., mis-assemblies or specific marker 51 gene presences6,7, which can lead to poor interpretation of divergent genomes 52 and high resource consumption costs. Other common statistics, for example 53 contig counts, total base pairs assembled, and L/N50, are reference-54 independent but provide only a glimpse of contiguity, which should not 55 substantially change during iterative processes that fix relatively small-scale 56 errors8. A broadly applicable and simple to compute assembly trait to help 57 estimate the quality of hybrid assemblies during long read correction and/or 58 short read polishing, for example predicted average gene length9,10, would aid 59 both novice and experienced users with complex sequencing projects. 60 Here, we performed multiple variations of correction and polishing 61 strategies to examine the effects of these processes on microbial community 62 metagenomic datasets. Two long-term laboratory-scale nitrifying bioreactors 63 were sequenced using both Illumina MiSeq (short-read, SR) and Oxford 64 Nanopore Technology (long-read, LR) platforms and assembled with multiple 65 programs to allow for initial biological and computational variation. LR 66 assemblies were then corrected with LRs and polished with SRs using free, 67 common tools in the field. We primarily monitored the following four features 68\nthroughout the iterative correction and polishing processes to empirically 69 determine the optimum draft community assembly quality: gene fragmentation, 70 SR recruitment, medium-quality or better automated bin yields, and beta-71 diversity of single copy marker genes. All metrics followed the same trends that 72 supported common conventions in literature and online guidance \u2013 the greatest 73 improvements across nearly all possible quality metrics occurred within the first 74 two iterations of LR correction followed by two iterations of SR polishing. 75 However, LR correction generally was noisy, and neither LR correction nor SR 76 polishing beyond 5 iterations showed substantial improvements in any 77 assembly quality metric. Fortunately, the patterns for simpler, reference-78 independent features (i.e., gene fragmentation and SR recruitment) were 79 essentially the same as more complex, reference-dependent features (i.e., 80 automated bin quality, beta diversity), which could serve as less resource-81 exhaustive proxies and easier to implement in automated processes. Finally, 82 we offer practical guidelines to aid users to empirically determine their own 83 optimal high-quality data yields via hybrid metagenomic assembly. 84 85 Methods 86 Long and short read sequencing 87 Biomass was collected in November 2020 and March 2021 from long-term, 88 autotrophic nitrifying enrichment cultures maintained in either oxygen- (OLR) or 89 nitrogen-limited (NLR) conditions in a tandem laboratory-scale bioreactor 90 system inoculated in 2015 with wastewater treatment plant activated sludge 91 from the Bavaria Brewery in Lieshout, The Netherlands (51.518666 N, 92 5.613009 E). Comprehensive analysis of these bioreactor communities is an 93 on-going project and will be published separately. Genomic DNA was extracted 94 from the biomass using a conventional N-cetyl-N,N,N,-trimethyl ammonium 95 bromide (CTAB) protocol in 2020, and the Powersoil DNA Isolation kit (Qiagen) 96 in 2021 with minimal modifications to the manufacturer\u2019s directions to reduce 97 DNA shearing such as inverting rather than vortexing or pipetting to mix. 98 In total 1 ng of DNA for both the OLR and NLR reactors was used to 99 prepare a library using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina, San Diego, California 100 U.S.A.) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. After quality and quantity 101 check of the libraries, they were paired-end sequenced (2x 300bp) using the 102\nIllumina MiSeq sequencing machine and the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (San Diego, 103 California USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Oxford Nanopore 104 Technologies (ONT) sequencing was done with 840 and 1670 ng DNA for the 105 OLR and NLR reactors, respectively, after library preparation using the Ligation 106 Sequencing Kit 1D (SQK-LSK108) and the Native Barcoding Expansion Kit 107 (EXP-NBD104), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (Oxford Nanopore 108 Technologies, Oxford, UK). The libraries were loaded on a Flow Cell (R9.4.1) 109 and sequenced on a MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, 110 UK), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Guppy (version 4.0.11)11 was 111 used to basecall fast5 files using the dna_r9.4.1_450bps_hac.cfg model, both 112 provided by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. 113 Raw sequencing reads for both bioreactors and technologies are 114 available at NCBI via BioProject PRJNA1005948 as the following BioSamples: 115 SAMN37004618, raw MiSeq reads for the OLR; SAMN37004620, raw Oxford 116 Nanopore Technologies reads for the OLR; SAMN37004619, raw MiSeq reads 117 for the NLR; SAMN37004621, raw Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads for 118 the NLR. 119 120 Long-read, short-read, and hybrid microbial community metagenomic assembly 121 An overview of the experimental design is shown in Fig. 1. All computational 122 programs were employed with default settings unless explicitly stated. Generic 123 example code is available in File S1. 124\nmulti-species metagenome (hybrid only). The k-mer list generated by 147 automated selection during Unicycler hybrid assembly was used for 148 metaSPAdes assemblies. While the focus here was optimizing a hybrid 149 approach that leveraged the continuity of the long-read assemblies, these 150 SPAdes-dependent assemblies served as a baseline for implementing SR-151 focused assembly approaches. 152 Two programs were used for assembly of LR data: Canu (version 1.8)16 153 that performs read correction prior to assembly and is generally thought to 154 result in more accurate assemblies, and Flye (version 2.9-b1768)17 that 155 performs correction of the assembly using the input reads and is generally 156 thought to sacrifice some accuracy for better resource efficiency. Both 157 assemblers were used in three different ways: (1) default settings (\u201cdef\u201d) 158 developed for single-genomes, (2) metagenomic settings (\u201cmeta\u201d) to improve 159 assembly of sequences with uneven depths2,17, and (3) metagenomic settings 160 for approximately even bp sub-samples (\u201csub\u201d) of the reads to artificially reduce 161 the sequencing depth and possibly uncover biological variation. Long reads 162 were sub-sampled into 12 read pools with approximately the same quantity of 163 bps using the \u201csubsample\u201d utility of Trycycler (version 0.4.1)18. All assemblies 164 were filtered to a 4 kbp minimum contig length prior to any downstream 165 analyses. 166 167 Long read correction and short read polishing 168 Consensus correction of individual LR \u201cmeta\u201d assemblies was performed using 169 Racon (version 1.3.1)19 up to 10 iterations, the greatest number identified 170 among literature and published automated tools15. For each iteration of Racon 171 correction, minimap2 (version 2.17-r941)20 was used with default settings to 172 recruit LRs to the original assembly or previous iteration\u2019s corrected assembly 173 to generate the overlap information. Contigs that were not corrected were 174 written with the optional flag \u201c-u\u201d, and though it was not done here the optional 175 flag \u201c-f\u201d may allow multi-mapping of the LRs. SR pile-up polishing of LR \u201cmeta\u201d 176 assemblies was performed using Pilon (version 1.23)21 to 10 iterations after 0 177 (original assembly), 2, 5, and 10 rounds of LR correction. These stages were 178 chosen to include common (0 and 2) LR correction endpoints found in literature 179 and online guidance, and relatively extensive (5 and 10) LR correction 180\nendpoints that are observed in existing pipelines like Unicycler. We did not test 181 SR polishing after 1 iteration of LR correction because it was essentially never 182 observed in published literature or online guides. For each iteration of SR 183 polishing, bbmap (BBtools version 37.76) was used to recruit SRs to the original 184 assembly, Racon-corrected assemblies, or previous iteration\u2019s polished 185 assembly to generate alignment fragments, using a 97.5% identity filter and 186 retaining all ambiguous alignments. Because we found no examples of LR 187 correction after SR polishing and it is expected to re-introduce errors, this was 188 not performed here. 189 190 Assembly quality estimation 191 Programs for estimating quality were used with default settings except when 192 explicitly stated otherwise. Assemblies were compared using metaQuast 193 (version 5.0.2)22 without references to examine the distribution of contig counts 194 and lengths. Recruitment of SRs to the assemblies to quantify aligned reads 195 and ambiguity was performed using BBmap (BBtools version 37.76) with 196 retaining only perfect mappings of paired reads and ambiguous mappings 197 randomly assigned. Open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted using 198 Prodigal (version 2.6.3)23 using the \u201cmeta\u201d procedure for quantification of gene 199 counts and lengths, and as input for downstream analyses of assembled genes. 200 The \u201cmeta\u201d procedure of Prodigal was implemented prior to downstream 201 analytical pipelines because it led to increased marker gene recovery 202 estimates, though following similar trends (data not shown), compared to the 203 outputs of the analytical pipelines that assume inputs are single genomes and 204 therefore run prodigal in \u201csingle\u201d mode by default. Phylogenetic marker gene 205 recovery, fragmentation, and redundancy were estimated by Benchmarking 206 Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO, version 5.1.2)24 using \u201cgenome\u201d 207 mode and only the \u201cbacteria_odb10\u201d lineage, as well as CheckM (version 208 1.1.3)25 using the taxonomy workflow for the domain \u201cBacteria\u201d. Gene 209 fragmentation of entire assemblies was estimated by comparing to a Diamond 210 (version 0.9.31)26 database of the uniref50 (downloaded 2023-03-01)27 dataset 211 using IDEEL (downloaded 2023-05-13)10. To more concretely associate 212 potential complete genome contigs with the domain bacteria, circular and long 213 (>1 Mbp) contigs were also analyzed individually using the Genome Taxonomy 214\nDataBase toolkit (GTDB-tk, version 1.6.0 with reference database version 215 r202)28. Based on the GTDB-tk output for circular contigs alone, there were 216 members of at least 6 and 5 distinct Bacterial phyla present in the OLR and 217 NLR, respectively (data not shown). Microbiomes with abundant Archaea or 218 Eukaryotes may need to adjust these taxonomically constrained pipelines to 219 better suit their ecosystem. 220 221 Automated binning and beta diversity 222 Programs for automated binning and estimation of genome quality, as well as 223 identification and coverage calculation of marker genes, were used with default 224 settings except where noted otherwise. 225 Both LRs and SRs from both bioreactor datasets were used for read 226 depth calculation of contigs using the mmlong (version 0.1.2)29 utility 227 readcoverage2. Automated binning using composition (i.e., tetranucleotide 228 frequency) and coverage (i.e., read depths) was then performed using 229 Metabat2 (version 2.12.1)30. The quality of automated bins was estimated using 230 CheckM (version 1.1.3)25, with cutoffs of >50% completeness and <10% 231 contamination scores as \u201cmedium quality\" (MQ). These oversimplified 232 thresholds are no longer en vogue, but represent computationally simple, rapid, 233 and bulk estimates compared to contemporary, thorough requirements that 234 include other information like rRNA and tRNA counts31. 235 The RNA polymerase subunit B (rpoB) is a protein-coding gene typically 236 found only once in a genome and is universally conserved among Bacteria, 237 Archaea, and Eukarya, and therefore is tractable to serve as a marker gene for 238 individual species to complement the often poorly assembling 16S rRNA gene 239 for gene-centric phylogenetic analyses of metagenomes. RpoB genes were 240 identified in assembled contigs using hmmer (version 3.1b2)32 with the 241 available model and thresholds for the Protein FAMily (pfam) identifier 242 PF04563.15 (downloaded 2020-06-09). To observe beta-diversity, rpoB-243 containing contigs throughout the iterative correction and polishing processes 244 were compiled for the each bioreactor and assembler separately, and then the 245 LRs and SRs from both bioreactor datasets were used for coverage estimation 246 for rpoB-containing contigs using the mmlong (version 0.1.2)29 utility 247 readcoverage2. The Bray-Curtis abundance-rank dissimilarity between each 248\nread set was calculated for subsequent two-axis Non-Metric multi-Dimensional 249 Scaling (NMDS) performed using vegan (version 2.5-7)33 in R (version 4.1.2)34, 250 and the values were then manually mean-centered and scaled for better 251 comparability. These NMDS analyses were unable to converge after 50 tries 252 due to low stress, but here the species scores were used to view the clustering 253 and trajectories of the rpoB-containing contigs\u2019 \u201cspecies scores\u201d for each 254 assembly rather than the four reads\u2019 \u201csite scores\u201d. 255 256 Further data analysis and visualization 257 Logs and outputs were mined for data using various bash commands. Data 258 were ultimately imported into R (versions 4.1.2)34 for analysis and visualization 259 relying primarily on tidyverse (version 1.3.1)35. Most calculations were 260 additionally normalized to contig length in Mbps to make bioreactors and 261 assemblers more comparable. No specific code was developed for this project 262 due to the focus on applying end-user tools. 263 264 Results 265 Short read, long read, and hybrid assembly baselines 266 SR sequencing yielded 7.56 million paired-end reads totaling 4.06 Gbp, and 267 8.73 million paired-end reads totaling 4.60 Gbp of data after low quality read 268 removal and base trimming for the OLR and NLR, respectively. LR sequencing 269 yielded 318 thousand reads totaling 3.13 Gbp, and 416 thousand reads totaling 270 4.01 Gbp of data after low quality read removal and base trimming data for the 271 OLR and NLR, respectively (Table S1). Reads were either assembled alone 272 (SR-alone or LR-alone) or used as inputs for automated SR-first hybrid 273 assembly. There were substantial differences between assemblies of the 274 bioreactors of approximately 63 total assembled Mbp on average (Fig. S1), 275 which we infer was due to the greater sequencing depths for the NLR compared 276 to the OLR rather than any biological differences. 277 In addition to biological and/or sequencing depth effects on the 278 assemblies, the assembly approach implemented by the different programs 279 also had a substantial effect on the assembly outcome. This was apparent 280 across many aspects of these assemblies: LR assemblies were larger in terms 281 of total bps (on average 1.35-fold), they were less fractured such that a greater 282\nfraction of bps were on larger contigs (1.69-fold), and they yielded more 283 circularized contigs (2.34-fold for count and 5.5-fold for total bps) (Text S1, Figs. 284 S1, S2A, S3). However, probable complete microbial genomes, i.e., a single 285 contig greater than 0.5 Mbp and ideally circular, reconstructed with SR and SR-286 first hybrid assemblies tended to have higher completeness scores on average 287 (1.73-fold for long contigs and 1.38-fold for circular, Text S1, Fig. S2B, S3). 288 Thus, baseline assemblies recapitulate most benchmarking studies that LR 289 assemblies lead to better contiguity, but SR assemblies are more accurate. Still, 290 the contiguity of the LR assemblies offers advantages for microbial community 291 reconstruction with sufficient LR correction and/or SR polishing to resolve mis-292 assemblies. 293 From here, we explored these metagenome-optimized LR assemblies 294 by monitoring the assembly quality while performing LR correction with Racon 295 and SR polishing with Pilon in order to determine the optimal approach for these 296 communities. We sought metrics that should noticeably change, in contrast to 297 for example the size and contiguity of the assembly, for assessing microbial 298 community-scale quality, and that ideally would also be relatively independent 299 of reference and database composition. Given known errors in LR assemblies, 300 we focused on the following assembly-level information criteria to help 301 determine possible optimal correction and polishing iterations: gene 302 fragmentation because indels in LR lead to frameshifts that fracture genes, and 303 SR recruitment because these reads are more accurate. Additionally, we 304 followed automated bin recovery and single phylogenetic marker gene beta 305 diversity to understand how these LR correction and SR polishing might 306 influence typical genome- and gene-centric analyses performed on 307 metagenomic datasets. 308 309 Gene fragmentation 310 Small scale errors (i.e., insertions, deletions, and substitutions) in LRs are well-311 documented issues for using these platforms that cause gene fragmentation in 312 the resulting assemblies10. Studies have already demonstrated that average 313 gene length can be a practical parameter for tracking assembly quality, for 314 example with viral populations9 or MAG collections10. As a precursor to many 315 downstream analyses, coding gene identification with programs like Prodigal 316\nallow direct estimates of coding gene contents, while other programs like IDEEL 317 and BUSCO can more directly estimate gene fragmentation by comparison to 318 a reference database. 319 Consistent with overall assembly statistics (see above), the NLR 320 contained both more genes (1.34-fold) and more bps in genes (1.39-fold) than 321 the OLR, likely due to sequencing depth. The Flye assemblies contained more 322 bps in genes (1.23-fold) but only slightly more total genes (1.10-fold) compared 323 to Canu, indicating better initial assembly quality (Text S1). On average, gene 324 fragmentation did not markedly improve, either in reducing the number of 325 coding genes or increasing the quantity of bps in coding genes, due to LR 326 correction but did substantially improve after just two iterations of SR polishing 327 (0.81-fold for gene count, 1.12-fold for bps in genes; Fig. S4). The same 328 patterns were noticeable not only for the entire assembly, but also for several 329 relevant assembly fractions principally ready for downstream analyses \u2013 330 circular and long contigs that may represent essentially complete microbial 331 sequences, and medium quality or better automated bins (Text S1, Figure S4, 332 Fig. S5). 333 Comparison of these coding genes to databases showed similar 334 patterns. After just two iterations of SR polishing, assessing the entire 335 assemblies with BUSCO indicated that bacterial marker genes were no longer 336 found only fragmented (Text S1, Fig. S5), and IDEEL indicated that the number 337 of coding genes with length within 5% of their most similar reference sequence 338 considerably increased (2.7-fold, Text S1, Fig. S6). All gene length analyses 339 followed similar patterns and linear regression demonstrated that the number 340 of coding genes within 5% of their most similar reference gene length was 341 strongly correlated to the total number of base pairs in coding genes (R2 \u22670.94, 342 p-adj <<0.05, Fig. 2). This means that less resource-exhaustive analyses can 343 act as an equally good assembly quality indicator. We acknowledge that the 344 resulting data are unevenly distributed across both dependent and independent 345 variables in this analysis, but the correlation holds when looking at only the first 346 three SR polishing iterations as well, albeit weaker (adjusted R2 0.6-0.75, p-347 value <<0.05, data not shown). Furthermore, several similar calculations such 348 as total number of coding genes, and median number of coding genes and bps 349 in coding genes normalized to contig length (data not shown) were also 350\ncorrelated, and therefore these simpler, less resource-exhaustive assembly 351 quality indicators are robust proxies to reduce computational resource 352 requirements and database-dependency for gene fragmentation estimates 353 from BUSCO or IDEEL. 354 355\nMultiple iterations of correction and polishing are performed in published 369 literature and suggested by community guidance because it is expected that 370 newly fixed errors allow different read pools to align. Then theoretically, read 371 pools would stabilize when the assembly achieves high accuracy. Additionally, 372 in a community where multiple strains co-exist and/or species encode 373 duplicated genes, the quantity of reads that are ambiguously recruited (i.e., 374 aligning to two or more positions) should decrease as the accuracy of the 375 sequences improves to resolve minor sequence differences. Here, information-376 rich outputs from BBmap were analyzed for the total number of aligned SR bps, 377 assembled contigs to which no SRs aligned, and ambiguously aligned SRs to 378 observe the magnitudes in which these features change during LR correction 379 and SR polishing. 380 Consistent with gene fragmentation changes, LR correction offered 381 minimal improvement and SR polishing led to drastic improvement in SR 382 recruitment profiles. Unexpectedly, sequencing depth had little effect on SR 383 recruitment results, in contrast to the used assembler program. Here, Flye 384 assemblies initially recruited more SR bps (1.64-fold) and had smaller 385 percentage of contigs that did not recruit any SRs (2.59-fold, Text S1). These 386 data along with the larger proportion of SRs that align ambiguously (2.02-fold, 387 Text S1) suggests that the Flye assemblies may be of higher quality and 388 possibly capable of reconstructing similar yet distinct strains. On average, LR 389 correction led to approximately 25-35% increases in total SR bps recruited, SR 390 bps recruited normalized to contig length, and SR alignment ambiguity, but only 391 about a 10% reduction in contigs lacking SR recruitment (Text S1). In contrast, 392 SR polishing greatly improved SR recruitment across all measured metrics, 393 including increased total SR bps recruited (3-fold) and median SR bps recruited 394 normalized to contig length (10-fold), fewer contigs lacking any SR recruitment 395 (30% reduction), and a smaller fraction of ambiguously aligned SRs (26% 396 reduction, Fig. 3, Text S1). 397\n398\nA primary goal for many microbial community metagenomic sequencing 414 approaches is to reconstruct high-quality, ideally essentially complete genomes 415 of as many of the members as possible. With these data, it is possible, and is 416 becoming more tractable for a wider range of scientists, to link genetic 417 information with (non)biological phenomena from gene or protein expression to 418 biochemistry or kinetics and even incorporating it into larger-scale modeling 419 efforts. Therefore, attaining optimal microbial genomic data is the desired 420 outcome for a hybrid metagenomic assembly and error-fixing strategy. 421 Assemblies at each stage of LR correction and SR polishing were automatically 422 binned, and both the assemblies and bins were assessed with CheckM to 423 estimate the quality of microbial genomes and estimate the redundancy by 424 counting the 104 bacterial marker genes and reporting the copy number of each 425 gene and the estimated completion and contamination percentages. 426 Automated bin recovery followed similar patterns as gene fragmentation 427 and SR recruitment, displaying major improvements due to SR polishing and 428 minor due to LR correction. LR assemblies themselves yielded very few 429 medium-quality or better (MQ) automated bins, only 9.5 on average. LR 430 correction increased the number of MQ bins by three to 12.3 on average, but 431 SR polishing alone almost doubled the number of MQ bins, and in combination 432 with LR correction more than doubled the initial MQ bin count on average (Fig. 433 4, Text S1, Fig. S7). Additionally, the mean completeness scores for MQ bins 434 remained in the low 70% range after only LR correction but increased to over 435 80% as a result of SR polishing (Fig. 4, Text S1, Fig. S7), indicating an increase 436 in the quality of recovered genomic contents. Furthermore, the substantial 437 increases in MQ bin count and quality due to SR polishing were matched by 438 large increases in the quantity of both number of contigs (7.17-fold) and bps 439 (1.92-fold) contained in MQ bins (Fig. 4, Text S1, Fig. S7), suggesting that SR 440 polishing improved the ability for contigs to be binned. Akin to previous 441 analyses, MQ bin recovery in terms of count, average quality, and data included 442 tended to peak or stabilize as a result of both LR correction and SR polishing, 443 but the exact yields were noisy for clear saturation signal like most other 444 analyses, indicating that automated binning at any of these points should still 445 undergo manual curation prior to downstream analyses. 446\nBacterial marker gene redundancy estimated by CheckM for the full 447 assemblies followed similar patterns as automated bin recovery and most other 448 analyses. The estimated copy number of marker genes, as well as redundancy, 449 i.e., the sum of CheckM completion and contamination scores reached their 450 maximum values after two iterations of SR polishing, with greatest redundancy 451 after both LR correction and SR polishing (Fig S7, Text S1). Intriguingly, this 452 estimated redundancy of the assemblies was strongly correlated (R2 \u22670.85, p 453 <<0.05) to the number of MQ bins recovered (Fig S8, Text S1), and could be 454 used as a preliminary indicator of genome yield prior to automated binning. 455 456\nvalue per combination of bioreactor and assembler of one of the following 465 characteristics MQ automated bins: the number of MQ bins recovered (\u201ccount\u201d), 466 the mean completeness score of the bins estimated by CheckM (\u201cmean 467 completeness\u201d), the number of contigs in MQ bins (\u201ccontigs\u201d), and the quantity 468 of bps in MQ bins (\u201cbps\u201d). Matching color diamonds indicate the LR correction 469 and/or SR polishing stage with the maximum observed value for each 470 characteristic. 471 472 Microbial community beta diversity 473 Complementing genome-centric approaches, many studies perform gene-474 centric analyses that better handle poorly assembled community members. The 475 RNA Polymerase subunit B (rpoB) gene is a phylogenetic marker for all 476 domains of life and was used here for beta-diversity clustering analysis by using 477 their SR recruitment profiles via Non-Metric multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS). 478 This would then also combine the various types of data already discussed, 479 particularly improvements for gene fragmentation should yield better microbial 480 community representation and changes in SR recruitment pools should affect 481 the abundance of these genes. 482 Inferred microbial community beta diversity was strongly influenced by 483 both LR correction and SR polishing, but only SR polishing led to stabilized 484 clusters. Initial LR assemblies and assemblies with LR correction alone 485 contained fewer (2 total genes) and more fractured (1/3 the mean length) rpoB 486 genes compared to assemblies after SR polishing (Text S1, Figs. S9). 487 Unexpectedly, read depths on average appeared to decrease due to SR 488 polishing (Text S1, Figs. S10), presumably due to the identification of additional 489 rpoB genes on low abundance contigs after SR polishing made these genes 490 intact. Both improved rpoB recovery and depth profiles had clear effects on the 491 trajectories of their clustering: assemblies with only LR correction were noisy 492 compared to the convergence observable from SR polishing (Fig. 5). In most 493 cases, assemblies with SR polishing alone were distant from assemblies with 494 both LR correction and SR polishing, highlighting the beneficial impact of LR 495 correction only after SR polishing. 496\n497\nsecond LR correction stage as the communities converge due to SR polishing 508 for the NLR bioreactor\u2019s Flye assembly. 509 510 Discussion 511 Microbial community hybrid assembly optimization leveraging long reads for 512 correction and short reads for polishing 513 Assembly of LRs offers a major advantage over SR data alone, due to its 514 greater contiguity. However, it comes at a significant cost due to lower 515 accuracy. Integrated, or hybrid, assembly approaches leverage complementary 516 beneficial attributes of both LR and SR platforms to offset their weaknesses. 517 Programs already exist to perform this integration, often by SR assembly 518 followed by LR bridging the assembly graphs15, and some can even handle 519 mixed microbial communities3. Unfortunately, community complexity appears 520 to be an obstacle leading to fractured SR assemblies that these programs 521 cannot overcome (Fig. S1), likely, at least in part, because these programs were 522 not developed for these purposes. Therefore, we focused on leveraging the 523 contiguity of LR assemblies and with further LR correction and SR polishing to 524 yield high quality microbial community metagenomic data. 525 To gauge the quality of an assembly, often mis-assemblies are 526 quantified by comparison to reference databases, which however is not always 527 ideal for poorly characterized microorganisms or ecosystems. We thus 528 monitored relatively reference-independent assembly characteristics. 529 Specifically changes in gene fragmentation and SR recruitment were used as 530 indicators of assembly accuracy, and automated bin recovery and beta diversity 531 showed how these processes would affect microbial community reconstruction 532 for downstream analyses. Fortunately, essentially all four of these 533 characteristics followed the same overall patterns of improvements in sequence 534 accuracy and community reconstruction: (1) LR correction alone was 535 insufficient; (2) the greatest improvements occurred within the first three 536 iterations of SR polishing; (3) although the effects were not always immediately 537 apparent, the assemblies benefited from two to five iterations LR correction and 538 any changes after could be attributed to noise; (4) beyond five iterations of SR 539 polishing after LR correction provided severely diminished returns. 540 Furthermore, simple and reference-independent analyses were robustly 541\ncorrelated with more complicated and/or reference-dependent analyses, for 542 example, total bps in genes and count of genes within 5% of the most similar 543 reference length. Therefore, computational costs can be reduced by using 544 relatively simple calculations predictive of improvements to genome- and gene-545 centric analyses. Rather than inform other users of the best approach for their 546 own hybrid metagenomic microbial community projects, this study emphasizes 547 that some, but not exhaustive LR correction and SR polishing are necessary to 548 obtain high-quality metagenomic assemblies and equips users with simple 549 analyses to assess the optimum assembly without relying on reference 550 datasets. 551 552 Unexplored factors and issues in this study 553 First, recent technological advances for both LR sequencing and application 554 may ease the approach for integrating hybrid metagenomic assembly of 555 microbial communities, but this study was performed using older sequencing 556 chemistry and basecalling algorithms. Both major LR platforms, Pacific 557 Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have 558 achieved large improvements in chemistry and basecalling that have increased 559 both depth and accuracy of LR sequencing36,37. Therefore, not only will LR-560 alone assembly be more accurate as a result of these advances, it may even 561 become sufficient for retrieving HQ genomes without need for any SR 562 polsihing5,38. However, resources may restrict users to older and more 563 accessible technologies, or projects may already have older datasets that still 564 need analysis. Additionally, for the foreseeable future, SR accompaniments to 565 LR data will likely continue to be implemented as a far cheaper and more 566 accessible means to increase the sample count for differential coverage 567 binning. Furthermore, SRs may still aid assembly quality if applied properly by 568 implementing contemporary hybrid assembly and error-fixing approaches39. 569 Therefore, combining both sequencing technologies may be more cost-570 effective than either platform alone5 to yield the highest quality data. 571 Second, the myriad of programs and pipelines to process LRs from read 572 correction, to assembly, to assembly correction, SR recruitment and polishing, 573 and more continuously improve and expand4. To reasonably perform this study 574 and analyze the results, only two assembly, one LR correction, and one SR 575\npolishing programs were tested. These programs were chosen based on their 576 observed prevalence in literature and online resources, but are beginning to be 577 outcompeted by others that yield better results40. Additionally, not only are there 578 more and likely better program options, but these programs also come with a 579 suite of settings to fine-tune performance that were not explored. One setting 580 of particular interest that was not investigated here was read recruitment 581 stringency, which could greatly impact SR polishing of communities with 582 multiple similar strains, or genomes with multicopy genes or repeat regions that 583 will recruit reads ambiguously. However, it is not realistic for most labs to 584 explore all options, and the intent of this study was to explore assembly 585 statistics that were both relatively reference- and tool-agnostic. 586 Third, though relatively reference-agnostic, many analyses here 587 explored only bacterial phylogenetic markers. It is possible that communities 588 with, or a focus upon, eukaryotic or archaeal members may require modified 589 approaches or analyses given sometimes large differences in genomic 590 architectures. Preliminary analyses of the bioreactors sequenced in our study 591 suggested an absence of archaea, but cultivation work repeatedly overrun by 592 recurrent fungi indicates the possibility of Eukaryote presence. Cursory 593 analyses of the rpoB gene affiliations from these and related datasets include 594 at least three distinct probable amoeba endosymbionts41\u201343 (70-100% amino 595 acid identity) and at least three distinct ciliates (48-59% amino acid identity), 596 but still no archaea. Additionally, viruses and plasmids, which often assemble 597 poorly but can significantly impact microbial community ecology and 598 physiology, were largely ignored in this study. Given the plentiful small circular 599 contigs, or larger sometimes circular contigs with essentially no bacterial 600 markers, these non-bacterial community members may be prevalent in these 601 bioreactor communities, and may require different approaches to attain optimal 602 data quality6,9. Additionally, many cutoffs for genomic quality also excluded high 603 quality but unusual bacterial genomes. For example, members of Candidate 604 Phyla Radiation lineages tend to be small with low completion estimates despite 605 being complete and circularized44. Cursory phylogenetic investigation of 606 circular contigs from the initial assemblies included members of the 607 Gracilibacteria (formerly BD1-5)45. For most of these cases, other algorithms or 608\nsettings can be implemented to better identify Eukaryotes, Archaea, viruses, 609 plasmids, and unusual bacteria. 610 Fourth, contig pools were not separated for some analyses in order to 611 simplify the workflow. Specifically, in this workflow circular contigs that likely 612 constituted nearly complete bacterial genomes were not removed from the 613 assemblies prior to binning, which could result in chimeric automated bins. We 614 note here that across all LR assemblies, the mean and median automated bin 615 (completion >0%) contamination were 0.6% and 0%, respectively, though 51 of 616 14,965 bins did have contamination greater than 20%. The high degree of strain 617 heterogeneity (35-43%) in automated bins with contamination >20% indicates 618 that a substantial fraction of chimeric automated bins were composed of similar 619 strains. Similar to separating circular and large contigs prior to binning, 620 performing LR correction and SR polishing on contigs that are essentially 621 complete genomes separately from the rest of the assembly may lead to greater 622 improvements by potentially reducing read recruitment ambiguity. 623 Fifth and lastly, we acknowledge that the biomass collected for DNA 624 isolation and sequencing with the different platforms were separated by several 625 months. Though largely stable after enrichment for over five years, the 626 communities still shift slowly, thought largely due to strains competing for the 627 same niches, which will be examined in follow-up publications. These time 628 differences could impact ideal integration the LR and SR data if strains 629 substantially shifted in abundance, leading to improper error-fixing events and 630 could produce inaccurate consensus genomes rather than a realistic strain 631 representation. 632 633 Conclusions 634 Integrating LR and SR sequencing data for a microbial community is a complex 635 task. Not only can the biology be difficult to analyze for a variety of reasons, but 636 complementing the strengths and weaknesses of sequencing platforms or 637 computational workflows is challenging. Despite the improvements to LR 638 sequencing data that appear to preclude the need for SRs, we expect that SRs 639 will still be beneficial as low cost additional data for differential coverage, and 640 users may still desire to explore SR polishing to maximize their assembly 641 quality. Here, we\u2019ve tested multiple assemblers and variations on iterative 642\ncorrection and polishing, and performed analyses that aid empirically driven 643 decisions for integrating these datasets. Fortunately, commonly applied 644 workflows and word-of-mouth conventions were validated, briefly that use of 645 two tools (typically one tool using LRs and one SRs) with two iterations each is 646 sufficient, because the majority of improvement occurred within the first two 647 iterations of LR correction and SR polishing. It was apparent from all analyses 648 that the combination of LR correction and SR polishing yielded higher quality 649 assemblies than either alone, and also that neither process needed to be 650 iterated more than five times. These patterns were similar for gene 651 fragmentation and SR recruitment, as well as automated bin recovery and 652 community clustering trajectories, which enables simple calculations estimate 653 the results more complex analyses to save computational resources. Finally, 654 we offer guidelines to enable other users to integrate LR and SR sequencing 655 platforms for microbial community metagenomes with fewer obstacles and 656 guided by empirical data from their own projects. 657 658 Practical recommendations for users 659\n\u2022 Use the same pool or replicate extractions of DNA for both SR and LR, 660 which ideally minimizes community differences that might lead to mis-661 assembly. 662\n\u2022 Calculate read depth using bps rather than counts when mixing LR and 663 SR profiles, otherwise LR depth will be vastly and unevenly 664 underestimated. 665\n\u2022 If performing assembly-level marker gene inventory analyses using 666 programs like BUSCO or CheckM, use a separate gene-caller to identify 667 ORFS as an input to save resources and improve accuracy. 668 \u2022 If using these tools and parameters, limit LR correction to 2-5 iterations 669 and SR polishing to 5 iterations to preserve resources. 670 o Choose any LR correction iteration to follow with SR polishing; 671 there were few trends or notable differences between them. 672 o Choose at least 2 and up to 5 SR polishing iterations; 1 iteration 673 led to great improvements but 2 or 3 led to saturation of most 674 observed features, and the quantity of changes and bps changed 675\nduring SR polishing largely plateaued on a log-scale by iteration 676 4 (Fig. S11). Increasing the read recruitment stringency, which we 677 suggest, likely requires more iterations due to theoretically fewer 678 mis-assemblies being corrected each time. 679 o A mixture of different tools may improve the overall quality40, 680 possibly due to differential abilities to fix certain errors, but LR 681 correction should only be performed prior to SR polishing to avoid 682 the (re-)introduction of errors. 683 \u2022 While the ultimate goal might be genome recovery, we suggest 684 monitoring gene fragmentation or data collected during LR correction or 685 SR polishing for empirically guiding the endpoints rather than genome 686 recovery. 687 o Essentially all gene- and genome-centric analyses followed the 688 same trajectories, so simpler analyses should serve as 689 reasonable proxies for more complex options. 690 o Gene sizes are relatively simple to compute after running a gene-691 caller like Prodigal, which can also be precursor to downstream 692 analyses. 693 o Logged data from programs like Pilon are information-rich and 694 contain, for example, the number of changes and the amount of 695 bps changed, which could guide users. 696 o SR recruitment is an additional valuable tool to guide users\u2019 hybrid 697 approach, because many downstream analyses depend on read 698 depths, but costs more computational resources than other 699 options. 700\n\u2022 If possible, use multiple assembly programs prior to LR correction and 701 SR polishing, and then consolidate the genome outputs (circular, MQ 702 automated bins) because different algorithms may have a substantial 703 impact on which community members assemble well18. 704 705\nReferences 706 (1) Overholt, W.
