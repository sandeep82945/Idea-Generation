INTRODUCTION\nThe Standard Model (SM) has been very successful in describing the gauge interactions involving SM fermions, the Higgs boson, and gauge bosons. However, the observed values of fermion masses and mixing can only be accommodated with a judicious choice of free parameters, appearing in the Yukawa matrices, and cannot be predicted. In particular, the strong hierarchy among charged fermion masses, the potentially different type of mass spectrum in the neutrino sector, as well as the fact that only the Cabibbo angle is sizeable among quarks, while two of the mixing angles in the lepton sector are large, necessitate a profound explanation. Given the success of symmetries in describing the gauge interactions of the SM particles, it is tempting to also\nemploy a symmetryGf, acting on the flavor (or generation) space, in order to explain the features of fermion masses and mixing. Abelian symmetries, such as a U\u00f01\u00de group [1], have turned out to be sufficient in order to correctly accommodate the hierarchy among charged fermion masses by an appropriate choice of the U\u00f01\u00de charges of the different generations of the SM fermion species. However, fermion mixing, especially the striking difference between the mixing among quarks and leptons as well as the possibility to predict a certain mixing pattern (e.g., tribimaximal mixing among leptons [2\u20135]), points towards a non-Abelian, discrete group as flavor symmetry which can be broken nontrivially. For reviews about the application of these groups in high energy particle physics, see Refs. [6\u20139]. In recent years, there have been several measurements in flavor physics which deviate from the SM predictions and hint at a nontrivial flavor structure. BABAR [10,11], Belle [12\u201315], and LHCb [16\u201318] have measured the ratios,1\nR\u00f0D\u00f0\u22c6\u00de\u00de \u00bc \u0393\u00f0B \u2192 D \u00f0\u22c6\u00de\u03c4\u03bd\u00de\n\u0393\u00f0B \u2192 D\u00f0\u22c6\u00del\u03bd\u00de ; \u00f01\u00de\n*ibigaran@fnal.gov \u2020t.felkl@unsw.edu.au \u2021claudia.hagedorn@ific.uv.es \u00a7m.schmidt@unsw.edu.au\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The result of the combined fit leads to larger values for R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de and exhibits a tension with the SM prediction at the 3.4\u03c3 level [19]. There is also a long-standing discrepancy between the measured value [20,21] and the theoretical prediction [22\u201357] of the anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) of the muon, a\u03bc \u00bc \u00f0g \u2212 2\u00de\u03bc=2. The combined fit to the experimental data shows a 4.2\u03c3 tension [21] in \u0394a\u03bc \u00bc aexp\u03bc \u2212 aSM\u03bc .2 These three anomalies are summarized in Table I. In Ref. [65], Bauer and Neubert have proposed a simultaneous explanation of the flavor anomalies in terms of the scalar leptoquark (LQ) \u03d5 transforming as \u00f03; 1;\u2212 1\n3 \u00de\nunder the SM gauge group. The importance of LQ couplings to right-handed (RH) fermions has been emphasized in Refs. [66,67], and it has been demonstrated that the LQ \u03d5 cannot explain the discrepancies in b \u2192 s\u03bc\u03bc which requires the introduction of additional particles; see, e.g., Refs. [68\u201380]. In the vast majority of these studies, only the couplings which are needed to explain the flavor anomalies are introduced, while all other couplings are set to zero without providing any explanation for the vanishing of these couplings nor for the size of the nonzero ones. In this work, we construct a model with a discrete flavor symmetry to explain the observed flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and in the AMM of the muon. This model is also capable of correctly describing the strong hierarchy among charged fermion masses as well as the quark mixing, leaving aside neutrino masses and lepton mixing. Given this focus, the three generations of SM fermions are (mostly) assigned to a doublet and a singlet of Gf. For this reason, we choose a dihedral group as flavor symmetry. Both single-valued dihedral groups, Dn, as well as doublevalued dihedral groups, D0n, form series of groups that feature one- and two-dimensional irreducible representations in case the index n of the group Dn (D0n) is at least n \u00bc 3 (n \u00bc 2); see, e.g., Refs. [81\u201384] for their application\nto fermion mixing. A thorough analysis shows that a model with the flavor group Gf \u00bc D17 \u00d7 Z17 can pass all requirements, e.g., coming from the nonobservation of charged lepton flavor violating (cLFV) decays such as \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3. The residual symmetry Zdiag17 , the diagonal subgroup of Gf, which is preserved by the LQ couplings to the SM fermions, at leading order, is crucial in order to appropriately suppress those to the first generation of quarks and/or electrons. The breaking of the flavor symmetry is achieved with the help of four spurions that acquire a certain vacuum expectation value (VEV), given in terms of the expansion parameter \u03bb, \u03bb \u2248 0.22, of the model. For related studies on the use of flavor symmetries to explain the anomalies observed in semileptonic B meson decays, see Refs. [85\u201390]. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the model is introduced, the choice of Gf, its residual symmetry and the particle assignment are explained as well as the spurions necessary in order to achieve viable textures for the LQ couplings, and the charged fermion mass matrices are specified. The explicit form of the mass matrices and the LQ couplings in both the interaction basis and the charged fermion mass basis is derived in Sec. III. Analytical expressions for charged fermion masses and quark mixing are also given. Section IV serves as introduction to the phenomenological study which includes the analytical estimates, the numerical scan of the primary observables in Sec. V and the comprehensive numerical analysis of all observables in Sec. VI. We summarize and give an outlook in Sec. VII. Technical details and supplementary material are collected in Appendices A\u2013E."

            "text": "We choose a member of the series of dihedral groups Dn with n \u2265 3 as candidate flavor symmetry, as these groups contain several inequivalent one- and two-dimensional irreducible representations. This permits two distinct assignments of the three generations of SM fermions, either 1\u00fe 1\u00fe 1 or 2\u00fe 1. Both assignments prove to be useful for our purposes. For the charged fermions, we are motivated to use the assignment 2\u00fe 1 as much as possible, since the heaviest masses are associated with the third generation and the mixing between the first (second) and third generations of quarks is small. The doublets and singlets used for the different SM fermion species, left-handed (LH) quark doublets Qi, RH down-type quarks dRi, LH lepton doublets Li, and RH charged leptons eRi, are in general inequivalent. 3 We, consequently, expect that the index n of the dihedral group should be at least n \u00bc 9 in order to offer a minimum of four inequivalent two-dimensional representations. For the RH up-type quarks uRi, we choose to assign each generation to a singlet, 1\u00fe 1\u00fe 1, which may or may not be inequivalent.4 This can facilitate the accommodation of the very pronounced mass hierarchy among the up-type quarks. Such an assignment also simplifies the achievement of the desired texture of the LQ coupling y to RH charged leptons eRi and up-type quarks uRi; see Eq. (8). Thus, we are able to partially unify the three generations of four of the five different SM fermion species. We do not discuss neutrino masses nor lepton mixing in this work, which may otherwise hint at a different assignment of the three generations of LH leptons under the flavor symmetry. Furthermore, we consider a two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) of type-II [91,92], in which one of the Higgs fields, Hu, is responsible for the masses of up-type quarks,\nwhile the other one, Hd, provides the masses of down-type quarks and charged leptons. We assume the decoupling limit, in which the lightest Higgs boson is SM-like and the further scalars are decoupled. This can be achieved, e.g., in case one of the VEVs is induced [93].5 Considering a 2HDM simplifies the search for and, at the same time, amplifies the choice of a suitable flavor symmetry, as we see below. We can thus write the Lagrangian containing the Yukawa couplings of the charged fermions as follows:\nLYuk \u00bc \u2212YuijQiHuuRj \u2212 YdijQiHddRj \u2212 YeijLiHdeRj \u00fe H:c:; \u00f02\u00de\nwith the Yukawa coupling matrices Yu, Yd, and Ye being, in general, complex three-by-three matrices."

Rather, it is exploring the possibilities of capturing the main features of a particular flavor structure of the couplings of the LQ, \u03d5, to the SM fermions, which satisfactorily explains (some of) the present flavor anomalies, while also passing existing phenomenological constraints. For this reason, we begin with the Lagrangian containing the two relevant LQ couplings, before electroweak symmetry breaking,\nLintLQ \u00bc x\u0302ijLci\u03d5\u2020Qj \u00fe y\u0302ijecRi\u03d5\u2020uRj \u00fe H:c:; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere x\u0302ij and y\u0302ij are, in general, complex numbers. We define x\u0302 and y\u0302 as complex three-by-three matrices whose elements are denoted as x\u0302ij and y\u0302ij, respectively. The hatted notation b is used to indicate that these LQ couplings are given in the interaction basis of the SM fermions. The quantum numbers of \u03d5\u2020 coincide with those of the scalar LQ conventionally denoted S1 [94], i.e., under the SM gauge group \u03d5 \u223c \u00f03; 1;\u2212 1\n3 \u00de. In contrast to Ref. [94], we\nomit the possible coupling to RH neutrinos that are absent in this model as well as diquark couplings, since the latter can induce proton decay if not appropriately constrained. Imposing baryon number conservation forbids such diquark couplings. Additionally, we neglect possible couplings between the LQ \u03d5 and the Higgs doubletsHu andHd and assume that \u03d5 does not acquire a nonvanishing VEV. In this way, the LQ does not impact the potential of Hu and Hd. 3The fields dLi (uLi) denote the LH down-type (up-type) quarks that are the lower (upper) component of the LH quark doublets Qi. Similarly, the fields eLi (\u03bdLi) are the LH charged leptons (neutrinos), being the lower (upper) component of the LH lepton doublets Li.\n4Whether or not all RH up-type quarks can be assigned to inequivalent one-dimensional representations of the dihedral group depends on whether the index n of the chosen group is even or odd, since in the case of even n the group has four inequivalent singlets, while Dn with n odd only comprises two inequivalent singlets [83]. One could also consider double-valued dihedral groupsD0n, n integer, which all provide four inequivalent one-dimensional representations [83].\n5The potential of the two Higgs doublets Hu and Hd is not discussed and might require adding further scalar fields and/or terms, softly breaking the imposed symmetries, in order to correctly achieve the VEVs of Hu and Hd, shown in Eq. (13).\n075014-3\nIn the following, we use the results of Ref. [67] to derive suitable textures of the LQ couplings as a starting point for this model. In order to match the convention of Ref. [67], we change to the charged fermion mass basis,\nLmassLQ \u00bc xij\u00f0\u03bdmLi\u00dec\u03d5\u2020dmLj \u00fe yij\u00f0emRi\u00dec\u03d5\u2020umRj \u2212 zij\u00f0emLi\u00dec\u03d5\u2020umLj \u00fe H:c: \u00f04\u00de\nThe fields with the superscript m, umLi, u m Ri, d m Li, d m Ri, e m Li, e m Ri, and \u03bdmLi, represent the SM fermion fields in the mass basis. These are related to the fields, uLi, uRi, dLi, dRi, eLi, eRi, and \u03bdLi, in the interaction basis as follows, formulated in matrix-vector notation,\nuL \u00bc LuumL ; uR \u00bc RuumR ; dL \u00bc LddmL ; dR \u00bc RddmR ; eL \u00bc LeemL ; eR \u00bc ReemR and \u03bdL \u00bc Le\u03bdmL : \u00f05\u00de\nWe reiterate that the basis change of LH neutrinos coincides with the one of LH charged leptons, since neutrinos are massless in this model, and thus, lepton mixing is unphysical. The couplings xij, yij, and zij in Eq. (4) are, in general, complex numbers, like x\u0302ij and y\u0302ij, and we define the LQ couplings x, y, and z as complex three-by-three matrices with elements xij, yij, and zij, respectively. The two LQ couplings x and z in Eq. (4) both stem from the LQ coupling x\u0302 in Eq. (3) and are, consequently, related by the quark mixing matrix VCKM.\nC. Viable textures of leptoquark couplings\nPossible textures of the LQ couplings x and y that permit an explanation of the flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and in the AMM of the muon have been proposed and studied in numerous publications. The study in Ref. [67] has performed two separate scans of these couplings, each assuming a slightly different texture for y. We use the results of the scan in which the form of the LQ couplings x and y has been fixed to\nx\u00bc 0B@0 0 00 x22 x23 0 x32 x33 1CA and y\u00bc 0B@0 0 00 0 y23 0 y32 0 1CA; \u00f06\u00de where, a priori, all nonvanishing entries of x and y32 can be of order one (or even larger), while y23 is bounded as jy23j \u2264 0.05. A detailed analysis of the results of this scan shows that for m\u0302\u03d5 \u2272 5, where m\u0302\u03d5 measures the mass m\u03d5 of the LQ \u03d5 in TeV, the textures of x and y can be expressed in terms of the expansion parameter \u03bb,\n\u03bb \u2248 0.2: \u00f07\u00de\nOne viable set of textures is\nx \u223c 0B@ 0 0 00 \u03bb3 \u03bb 0 \u03bb2 1 1CA and y \u223c 0B@ 0 0 00 0 \u03bb3 0 1 0 1CA; \u00f08\u00de where each nonzero element is accompanied by a complex order-one number.6 In particular, x33 \u223c 1 and y32 \u223c 1 facilitate the explanation of the anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, while z23y23 \u223c x23y23 \u223c \u03bb4 helps to achieve \u0394a\u03bc \u223c 10\u22129. We concentrate on achieving these textures of x and y, with the zeros denoting elements (much) smaller than \u03bb4 \u223c 10\u22123. These couplings are specified in the basis where the down-type quark mass matrix, Md, and the charged lepton mass matrix, Me, are (nearly) diagonal, whereas the uptype quark mass matrix, Mu, is the origin of the CKM mixing matrix. The unitary transformation associated with the RH up-type quarks is assumed to be (close to) the identity matrix in flavor space. Furthermore, all fermion masses are canonically ordered, so that no additional permutations of columns and/or rows of the mass matrices are necessary. In order to proceed with the assignment of the particles to representations of the flavor symmetry, we first fix the transformation properties of the LQ \u03d5. We choose it to be in the trivial singlet of the entire flavor symmetry Gf. The elements x33 and y32 are both of order one and thus, should be nonzero in the limit of an unbroken flavor symmetry. More generally, this should be true for all couplings, including the Yukawa couplings of the charged fermions of order one, e.g., the Yukawa coupling that gives rise to the top quark mass. Otherwise, large flavor symmetry breaking effects would be needed, which are difficult to control. We discuss this issue, when addressing the charged fermion mass matrices in Sec. II D. To achieve x33 \u223c 1 constrains us to assign the third generation of LH lepton doublets, L3, and of LH quark doublets, Q3, to complex conjugated representations of the flavor symmetry. Furthermore, y32 \u223c 1 requires that the third generation of RH charged leptons, eR3, and the second generation of RH up-type quarks, uR2, also transform as complex conjugated representations. Note that they should be in complex conjugated representations given the form of the LQ couplings in Eq. (3). However, as all representations of (single-valued) dihedral groups are real, complex conjugation refers to an external ZN symmetry with N > 2, whose purpose becomes clear in the following. Indeed, we can fix, without loss of generality, L3 \u223c 11, Q3 \u223c 11, eR3 \u223c 11, and uR2 \u223c 11 under the dihedral group.\n6We note that many phenomenological analyses take the elements of the LQ couplings x and y to be real for simplicity. We refrain from doing so, since we do not include a CP symmetry in this model.\n075014-4"

The largest nonzero element of x and y that is not of order one is of order \u03bb. This determines the size of the symmetry breaking parameter, at least for the LQ couplings. We follow a minimalistic approach by generating all elements, x22, x23, x32, and y23, with the help of a single spurion, called S. Since these nonzero elements have different orders of magnitude in \u03bb, we expect that xij; yij \u223c \u03bbk arise from the insertion of k powers of the spurion.7\nThe insertion of a single spurion S for x23 \u223c \u03bb forces us to assign the spurion S to the same (real) two-dimensional representation of the dihedral group as the first two generations of LH lepton doublets L. This two-dimensional representation can be chosen without loss of generality as 21 of the dihedral group. Clearly, the VEV of the spurion also needs to be aligned in a specific way in order to only generate the element x23 \u223c \u03bb and not x13 at the same or similar level. We come back to this point in Sec. II C 2. Knowing that x32 \u223c \u03bb2 and thus is due to two spurion insertions, we have to have the first two generations of LH quark doublets,Q, in a representation different from 21 and, indeed, a suitable choice is 22, since the product of 21 with itself contains as two-dimensional irreducible representation 22; see Appendix A. Choosing L \u223c 21, butQ \u223c 22, also ensures that no large elements are generated among x11, x12, x21, and x22. At the level of three spurion insertions, S3, however, x22 \u223c \u03bb3 can be generated, as desired, compare Eq. (8). This is possible, since the product 21 \u00d7 21 \u00d7 21 can contain the doublet 23. Finally, we note that also y23 should be generated at order \u03bb3. So, the combination of the first two generations of RH charged leptons, eR, and of the RH up-type quark uR3 should transform as the same two-dimensional representation 23 (and possibly with an appropriate charge under an external ZN symmetry). We arrive at the conclusion that eR has to be in 23. We remind that it remains to be checked explicitly that only the element y23 \u223c \u03bb3 is generated and not y13 as well. Whether or not this happens, depends on the alignment of the VEVof the three spurion insertion and the relevant Clebsch-Gordan coefficients; see Appendix A. At the same time, we have to ensure that the elements y21 and y22 (and also y11 and y12) are not generated at order \u03bb3 or larger. The best option in order to achieve this goal is to assign different charges under an external ZN symmetry to the RH up-type quarks. This is in general also required in order to keep y32 \u223c 1 and y31 and y33 (much) suppressed,\nsince the dihedral group might not offer enough inequivalent one-dimensional representations to achieve this. In summary, we are able to generate all nonzero elements of the LQ couplings x and y of their correct order in \u03bb. Since we are in a nonsupersymmetric context, also the conjugated spurion S\u2020 can couple. Indeed, this cannot be avoided by the dihedral group as part of the flavor symmetry, since it only provides real representations. This is one of the arguments for considering as flavor symmetry the direct product of a dihedral group Dn and an external ZN symmetry with N > 2. Due to the size of the symmetry breaking parameter, \u03bb \u2248 0.2, the spurion S might not be suitable for generating charged fermion masses. Since these follow a stronger hierarchy, this would not be possible unless we could achieve this by multiple insertions of the spurion. As we see in Sec. II D, it is necessary to introduce three further spurions, T, U, and W, with different transformation properties under the flavor symmetry and with different VEVs (in size and/or alignment), for correctly describing the charged fermion masses and quark mixing."

            "text": "It is well-known that the zero elements in the first column and row of the LQ couplings x and y should be preserved to a high degree. As these couplings induce interactions involving the first generation of leptons and/or quarks, experimental bounds on them are particularly strong. In this model, we ensure such a suppression by a residual symmetry, i.e., the vanishing elements in x and y in Eq. (6) are protected from becoming nonzero, so long as the residual symmetry is intact. This residual symmetry is a subgroup of the flavor symmetry Dn \u00d7 ZN of the model. As residual symmetry, we use an Abelian symmetry because a non-Abelian one can easily become too constraining. A type of residual symmetry which has been successfully employed in approaches with flavor symmetries of the form X \u00d7 ZN is ZdiagN . The symmetry Z diag N corresponds to the diagonal subgroup of a ZN symmetry, contained in the non-Abelian group X, and the external ZN symmetry [95,96]. We, hence, choose N \u00bc n in the following, i.e.,\nGf \u00bc Dn \u00d7 Zn with a single index n: \u00f09\u00de\nFurthermore, we assume that the Zn symmetry contained in Dn is generated by the generator a of Dn\u2014see Appendix A for the generators of the dihedral group D17. Since the residual symmetry Z diag n should be preserved by the textures of the LQ couplings x and y, all nonvanishing elements of x and y in Eq. (6) should correspond to combinations of SM fermions (and the LQ \u03d5) with zero charge under Zdiagn . At the same time, 7Since we work in a nonsupersymmetric model, it can also be the conjugated spurion and/or some suitable combination of both.\n075014-5\nthe spurion S should acquire a VEV that is compatible with the preservation of this residual symmetry. We make the eventual choice,8\nn \u00bc 17: \u00f010\u00de\nIt is straightforward to derive a set of charges under the external Z17 symmetry in order to ensure the preservation of the residual symmetry in the LQ coupling x, given that we have already fixed that L3 \u223c 11, Q3 \u223c 11, L \u223c 21, Q \u223c 22 as well as S \u223c 21. Let us set the charge of L3 under the external Z17 symmetry to 1.9 Then, we have to have that Q3 carries the Z17 charge 16. Since L3 andQ3 are both singlets underD17, their charge under the external Z17 symmetry coincides with their charge under the residual symmetry Zdiag17 . Furthermore, the fact that both x23 and x32 in the LQ coupling x should be allowed as well, compare Eq. (6), requires L2 and Q2 to transform in the same way under the residual symmetry Zdiag17 as L3 and Q3, respectively. Knowing this, we can compute the charge of L \u223c 21, whose second component is L2, under the external Z17 symmetry, and arrive at 2 as Z17 charge for L. Similarly, we have for Q \u223c 22, whose second component is Q2, that its charge under the external Z17 symmetry is 1. Then, automatically also the element x22 in the LQ coupling x is invariant under the residual symmetry Zdiag17 . Additionally, we can check that L1 and Q1 both have the charge 3 under the residual symmetry Zdiag17 , and hence, none of the elements of the first column and row of the LQ coupling x is allowed in the limit of the residual symmetry Zdiag17 being preserved. In order to couple the spurion S in a Z17-invariant way to the combination Lc\u03d5\u2020Q3, we have to assign the Z17 charge 16 to S. For S \u223c 21 thus its first component S1 carries no charge under the residual symmetry Zdiag17 . Consequently, this has to be the component which acquires a nonzero VEV, while the VEV of the other one, S2, has to vanish,\nhSi \u00bc \u03bb\n0\n: \u00f011\u00de\nBy explicit computation, one can check that the other two operators, Lc3\u03d5\n\u2020QS2 as well as Lc\u03d5\u2020QS3, generating x32 and x22 of the appropriate size, are invariant as well. 10\nIn order to protect the vanishing elements in the LQ coupling y, we appeal to the residual symmetry Zdiag17 as well. To do so, we have to assign appropriate charges to the RH fermions uRi, eR, and eR3. Given that only two elements are nonzero in the limit of unbroken Zdiag17 , we can only fix a certain combination of Z17 charges. Therefore, the Z17 charges of the D17 singlets eR3 and uR2 should be opposite, e.g., for 9 being the Z17 charge of eR3, that of uR2 should be 8. Also, the charges of eR2, the second component of eR \u223c 23, and of the D17 singlet uR3 should be opposite under the residual symmetry. A possible choice is that eR2 has the Zdiag17 charge 16, since eR has the charge 2 under the external Z17 symmetry and thus uR3 carries the Z diag 17 charge 1\u2014which also corresponds to its charge under the external Z17 symmetry. With this Z17 charge assignment, we can check that apart from the elements y32 and y23 no other element of the second and third columns of the LQ coupling y is invariant under the residual symmetry Zdiag17 . We can, furthermore, explicitly check that the operator ecR\u03d5\n\u2020uR3S3 is invariant under the external Z17 symmetry. In order to avoid letting any element of the first column of y be invariant under Zdiag17 , we choose the charge of theD17 singlet uR1 under the external Z17 symmetry to be 13. The presented choice of Z17 charge assignments also takes constraints into account from the requirement of a correct description of charged fermion masses and quark mixing. It, furthermore, suppresses flavor violation, in particular involving the first lepton and/or quark generation, by limiting the contributions to the LQ coupling y from operators involving the other spurions T, U, W, and their conjugated fields. In Table II, the chosen charges of the different SM fermions, scalar fields and spurions under the residual symmetry Zdiag17 have been collected."

A valid choice is determined by the requirement that no contribution to the LQ couplings x and y nor to the charged fermion mass matrices, when including the spurions T, U, and W beyond S as well as their conjugated fields, is generated which perturbs the leadingorder structure of these and thus leads to unacceptably large flavor violation and/or wrong results for charged fermion masses and quark mixing.

(11), we note that the size of their VEVs is (significantly) smaller than that of the spurion S. We recall that the LQ couplings x and y are given in the mass basis of charged leptons and down-type quarks. This means Me and Md should be (almost) diagonal, while the CKM mixing matrix should arise from the up-type quark mass matrixMu, and the unitary transformation relating the interaction and mass bases of the RH up-type quarks should be (close to) the identity matrix.

Therefore, the hierarchy between the bottom quark (tau lepton) mass and the mass of the top quark can be generated via an appropriate hierarchy among the VEVs of the two Higgs doublets Hd and Hu.

In order to generate the mass of the muon and of the strange quark, we invoke a further spurion, T. One relevant operator is thus L\u0304HdeRT, requiring that the spurion T carries the charge 8 under the external Z17 symmetry.

Firstly, it allows the undetermined order-one coefficients accompanying the aforementioned operators to be used to correctly achieve the masses of both the electron and the down quark. This would not be possible with only the spurion T. Secondly, in this way, the computation of higher-order operators with several insertions of the spurions T and U is simplified, and their number can be controlled better. This concludes the discussion of the generation of the charged lepton and the down-type quark mass matrices. In the end, both mass matrices are not exactly diagonal, since further operators are always induced.12 We show in the next section that this neither poses a problem for the charged fermion mass matrices nor for achieving the textures of the LQ couplings x and y."

            "text": "In this section, we list the operators contributing to the charged fermion mass matricesMu,Md, andMe, and to the\nLQ couplings x\u0302 and y\u0302 from Eq. (3). We do so for operators that contribute up to and including order \u03bb12 in the symmetry breaking parameter, and assume that the VEVs of the spurions S, T, U, and W are of the form given in Eq. (18). Each operator is accompanied by a complex order-one coefficient. The lists of operators are usually ordered according to the number of spurion insertions. We further emphasize that the spurions are treated as dimensionless flavor symmetry breaking fields. Thus, no cutoff scale needs to be introduced to achieve the correct mass dimension of the operators. In the lists, the operators stand for all possible combinations of the involved fields, which lead to an invariant of the flavor symmetry Gf. Thus, they can correspond to more than one independent contribution to the charged fermion mass matricesMu,Md, andMe or the LQ couplings x\u0302 and y\u0302. We take this into account in the computation, and signal them by using primed coefficients in those instances, e.g., \u03b1d8 , \u00f0\u03b1d8\u00de0\u2014see Eq. (B2) in Appendix B. We generally omit all operators with insertions of powers of SS\u2020, TT\u2020, UU\u2020, and WW\u2020, and products thereof. Typically, these duplicate the contribution from the operator without this insertion, but have at least an additional suppression of order \u03bb2, \u03bb4, and\u2272\u03bb8, respectively. There are two exceptions to this rule: (a) the subleading-order (in \u03bb, SLO) contribution to the elements Mu;12 and Mu;22 of the up-type quark mass matrix involving SS\u2020, and (b) operators involving the insertion WW\u2020. For exception (a), the elements Mu;12 and Mu;22 carry the same parameter dependence at leading order (in \u03bb, LO), generated by the second operator in Eq. (19), but they receive partially different SLO corrections at relative order \u03bb2 from the first and second operators in Eq. (20), seen explicitly in Eq. (B1) in Appendix B. For exception (b), WW\u2020 also contains a covariant in 24 with a nonvanishing VEV, so some operators with this insertion can lead to nonredundant contributions\u2014although they are always suppressed by at least \u03bb8 with respect to contributions from operators without this insertion. After listing the operators, we present the form of the charged fermion mass matrices Mu, Md, and Me, analytic formulas for charged fermion masses, and the unitary matrices for LH and RH fermions, needed in order to arrive at the charged fermion mass basis. The latter are necessary to compute the LQ couplings x and y in Eq. (4) from x\u0302 and y\u0302, respectively, in Eq. (3). We also explicitly detail the form of the LQ coupling z, appearing in Eq. (4). All matrices, Mu, Md, Me, x\u0302, y\u0302, x, y, and z, are given in an effective parametrization, where the parameters are related to the coefficients of the contributing operators. For completeness, these relations can be found in Appendix B. For the analytic computations in this section, we assume all parameters to be real but note that they are\n075014-9\ntaken to be complex-valued in subsequent phenomenological studies. When computing the CKM mixing matrix VCKM, we find analytically and numerically that this model (as outlined so far) cannot be in full agreement with experimental data. Specifically, we find that a large enough value for Vtd and for the Jarlskog invariant JCP, as well as a correct value of Vub (with Vus and Vcb already fixed) cannot be produced. We comment on this in Sec. III A and point out how this issue can be solved with a slight change in the form of the up-type quark mass matrix Mu, i.e., by enhancing the element Mu;13 to be of the order \u03bb3hH0ui. We call the results obtained in this model without modification ofMu \u201cscenario A\u201d and those with the modification ofMu \u201cscenario B.\u201d The form of the LQ couplings x, y, and z is computed in both scenarios. The quark sector is discussed in Sec. III A, while the charged lepton sector is addressed in Sec. III B. Section III C is dedicated to the LQ couplings."

(20), the first two are the most important, since they contribute at relative order \u03bb2 to the elements Mu;12 and Mu;22. The operators with the coefficients \u03b1u6 and \u03b1 u 7 are examples of operators that appear automatically once the field content of the LO operators is determined. We note that several of these operators lead to two independent contributions to the up-type quark mass matrix Mu. The operator with the coefficient \u03b1u5 induces contributions of order \u03bb6 to the elementMu;22 and of \u03bb7 to the elementMu;12, but with a different relative sign; the one with \u03b1u14 gives contributions of order \u03bb\n10 and \u03bb11; the one with \u03b1u16 yields contributions of order \u03bb8 and \u03bb9; the onewith \u03b1u18 leads to contributions of order \u03bb8 and \u03bb9; finally, the operator with the coefficient \u03b1u20 gives rise to two independent contributions of order \u03bb10 and \u03bb11, respectively. The up-type quark mass matrix can thus be effectively parametrized, up to and including order \u03bb12, as\nMu \u00bc 0BB@ f11\u03bb8 f12\u03bb5 f13\u03bb8 f21\u03bb10 f22\u03bb4 f23\u03bb2\nf31\u03bb12 f32\u03bb4 f33\n1CCAhH0ui; \u00f021\u00de\nwhere fij are generally independent, complex order-one numbers, apart from f12 and f22. The latter fulfil the relation,\nf12 \u2212 f22 \u223c c\u03bb2; \u00f022\u00de\nwith c being complex.15 As mentioned above, the first two operators in Eq. (20), with the coefficients \u03b1u5 and \u03b1 u 6 , are the source of this difference\u2014see also Eq. (B1) in Appendix B. The expressions for the other parameters fij in terms of the coefficients \u03b1ui are given in Eq. (B1) in Appendix B as well. From the effective parametrization of Mu, we can derive expressions for the up-type quark masses. Note that in order to clearly show these results here (and in the following), we only explicitly mention the most relevant terms. Thus, the quark masses can be expressed as\n15In order to reflect this relation better in the effective parametrization of Mu, one can express the element Mu;12 as \u00f0f22 \u00fe f\u030312\u03bb2\u00de\u03bb5hH0ui instead, where f\u030312 is a complex order-one number.\n075014-10\nmu \u00bc jf11\u03bb8 \u00feO\u00f0\u03bb10\u00dejhH0ui;\nmc \u00bc f22\u03bb4 \u00fe f2122f22 \u2212 f23f32f33 \u03bb6 \u00feO\u00f0\u03bb8\u00de\nhH0ui; mt \u00bc\nf33 \u00fe f2232f33 \u03bb4 \u00feO\u00f0\u03bb8\u00de hH0ui: \u00f023\u00de\nWe confirm that the dominant contributions to the three different masses come from the first, second, and fourth operator in Eq.

(8). The obtained forms of Lu and Ru fulfil these requirements to a good degree. The largest deviation of Ru from the identity matrix is of order \u03bb4, due to the operator with the coefficient \u03b1u7 that appears automatically. As can be seen below, this deviation in Ru is partly responsible for the generation of the element y33 of the LQ coupling y\u0302 in the charged fermion mass basis of order \u03bb4\u2014compare Eqs. (56) and (B8) in Appendix B. Furthermore, Ru;21 \u223c \u03bb5 together with y\u030232 \u223c 1, see Eq. (51), has particular relevance for the texture of the same LQ coupling y, leading to y31 \u223c \u03bb5; see Eqs. (56) and (B8) in Appendix B."

This suppression originates from the entry Lu;13, which is only of order \u03bb8. Furthermore, the tight relation between the\nelements Lu;21, Lu;31, and Lu;32 leads to a too-strong correlation between Vus, Vub, and Vcb. These points are discussed further in Sec. III A 4.

We note that the operators with the following coefficients lead to more than one independent contraction, and hence contribution, to the down-type quark mass matrix.

On the one hand, it leads to an additional contribution to the quark mixing angle \u03b823, which is of the same order as the contribution arising from the up quark sector; see Lu in Eqs. (24) and (27) and compare the form of the CKM mixing matrix in Eqs. (35) (scenario A) and (38) (scenario B).

The first one with the coefficient \u03b1e4 has already been identified in the preceding section, compare footnote 12.

In both matrices, Le and Re, the (23)-block deviates from being close to the identity matrix. These deviations are induced by the operators with the coefficients \u03b1e4 and \u03b1 e 5, which have been identified as automatically allowed, if the LO operators for the charged fermion mass matrices and the LQ couplings x\u0302 and y\u0302 are accounted for. The effect of the rotation of order \u03bb in Le is to also contribute to the elements x22 and x23 of the LQ coupling x\u0302 in the charged fermion mass basis and to do so at the same order as the elements x\u030222 and x\u030223 of the LQ coupling x\u0302 itself, compare Eqs. (52) and (B6) in Appendix B. The impact of the rotation of order \u03bb3 in Re is to also generate the element y22 of the LQ coupling y\u0302 in the charged fermion mass basis of order \u03bb3 in addition to the element\ny\u030222 \u223c \u03bb3 of the LQ coupling y\u0302 itself; see Eqs.

Like before, we note that several of these operators lead to two independent contributions to the LQ coupling x\u0302. The operator with the coefficient \u03b2L5 leads to contributions of order \u03bb10 and \u03bb11; the one with \u03b2L6 gives contributions of order \u03bb7 and \u03bb8; the operator with \u03b2L10 induces two of order \u03bb11 and \u03bb12; the one with \u03b2L11 yields contributions of order \u03bb11 and \u03bb12; the one with \u03b2L13 gives rise to two of order \u03bb 8 and \u03bb9; finally, the operator with the coefficient \u03b2L21 leads to two independent contributions of order \u03bb11 and \u03bb12.

The presence of the first and the second operator is automatic after having fixed the transformation properties of the fields which are relevant for the LO terms of the charged fermion mass matrices Mu, Md, Me, and the LQ couplings x\u0302 and y\u0302. We note that all listed operators give rise to a single (independent) contribution to the LQ coupling y\u0302.\nWe arrive at the effective parametrization for y\u0302 to be of the form,\ny\u0302 \u00bc 0B@ b\u030211\u03bb 9 b\u030212\u03bb9 b\u030213\u03bb9\nb\u030221\u03bb9 b\u030222\u03bb3 b\u030223\u03bb3\nb\u030231\u03bb12 b\u030232 b\u030233\u03bb4\n1CA: \u00f051\u00de\n075014-16\nThe parameters b\u0302ij are, in general, complex order-one numbers and are related to the coefficients \u03b2Ri as shown in Eq. (B5) in Appendix B. We may already compare this result to the texture of the LQ coupling y in Eq. (8) and see that it contains the same two dominant terms, y\u030232 and y\u030223, like the texture with y32 \u223c 1 and y23 \u223c \u03bb3. At the same time, however, the form of the LQ coupling y\u0302 in Eq. (51) also has rather large elements y\u030222 \u223c \u03bb3 and y\u030233 \u223c \u03bb4. These arise from the operators with the coefficients \u03b2R3 and \u03b2 R 4 , which have been identified as automatically allowed, once the LO operators, contributing to the charged fermion mass matrices and LQ couplings x\u0302 and y\u0302, and their particle content are fixed. We note that none of the elements of the first column and row of the LQ coupling y\u0302 is larger than \u03bb9, showing the effectiveness of the residual symmetry Zdiag17 . Couplings to electrons and/or up quarks are thus suppressed."

            "text": "In this section, we display the results for the LQ couplings x, y, and z, namely the LQ couplings x\u0302 and y\u0302 in the charged fermion mass basis, compare Eq. (4). The LQ coupling x is obtained by applying the matrices Le and Ld to x\u0302, while z by applying Le and Lu to x\u0302. The LQ coupling y is generated from y\u0302 by applying the matrices Re and Ru. In doing so, we distinguish between the two different scenarios, scenario A and scenario B, for the LQ couplings z and y. We use the matrices Le and Ld in Eqs.

At the same time, the elements x33, x23, x32, and x22 have the expected order of magnitude in \u03bb. In scenario A.\u2014The model without any modification of the up-type quark mass matrix Mu, we find the form of the LQ coupling z, when applying the matrices Le and Lu, see Eqs.

(51), to eij of the charged lepton mass matrix Me in Eq. (42) and to fij of the up-type quark mass matrixMu in Eq. (21). These relations are given in Eq. (B8) in Appendix B. Comparing this form of the LQ coupling y with the texture in Eq. (8), we see that in the charged fermion mass basis not only the elements y22 \u223c \u03bb3 and y33 \u223c \u03bb4 turn out to be larger, but also the element y31 \u223c \u03bb5. As we see in Sec. VA, these couplings do not enter the analytic estimates for the strongest (primary) constraints on this model. We find that they generally lead to subleading contributions to these estimates or appear in the estimates for secondary/ tertiary observables, discussed further in Sec. VI. For example, y22 contributes to the process b \u2192 c\u03bc\u03bd, relevant for subdominant contributions to the LFU ratios R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and for the secondary observables R\u03bc=eD and Re=\u03bcD\u22c6 . The LQ coupling y33 relates the top quark to the tau lepton and shows up in subdominant loop-level contributions to tau lepton decays, including \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3. The LQ coupling y31 is relevant for subleading contributions to the decay B \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd, representing a secondary observable, and to tau lepton decays to light mesons, e.g., \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c0\u03bc, which correspond to tertiary observables. The LQ couplings y1j involving the electron are still suppressed.\nIn scenario B.\u2014Where the element Mu;13 of the up-type quark mass matrix Mu is enhanced, see Eq. (26), the matrices Lu and Ru are found in Eqs. (27) and (28). When using these in order to compute the form of the LQ coupling z, we find the following: while the order of magnitude in \u03bb of the different elements of z is not changed with respect to the matrix shown in Eq. (53), the relations of the effective parameters cij to the parameters a\u0302ij, eij, fij, and f\u030313 are to some extent altered. If we compare these to the expressions in Eq.

            "text": "We classify all analyzed observables to one of the following three categories: primary, secondary, or tertiary observables. The primary observables comprise the anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and in the AMM of the muon, as well as the observables for which contributions generated in this model can (substantially) violate the current experimental bounds and/or are accessible in upcoming experiments. 16The parameter cB13 is new with respect to the parametrization of z in Eq. (54).\n075014-18\nExamples of the former are the radiative cLFV decays \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3, while processes such as \u03bc \u2192 3e and \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in aluminium belong to the latter. These observables are studied analytically in Sec. V, and numerically in Secs. V and VI. Secondary observables, for instance, B \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd, do not presently provide any competitive constraint but are expected to offer an opportunity to further test this model in the midterm future. These are discussed both analytically and numerically in Sec. VI. Tertiary observables, such as the AMM of the electron, do not lead to any restriction on the parameter space of the model given the present experimental status. We find numerically that they do not deviate significantly from the SM predictions. The projected sensitivity for these observables is thus not sufficient to probe a signal consistent with this model. However, if a deviation from the SM prediction is observed, this could challenge the model. We mention them in Sec. VI and Appendix E 3, and incorporate them in the second numerical scan.\nB. Implemented model setup\nAs mentioned in Sec. II A, the presented model contains two Higgs doublets,Hu andHd, that give masses to up-type quarks as well as to down-type quarks and charged leptons, respectively, upon electroweak symmetry breaking. Nevertheless, we simplify the model in the phenomenological study and consider the decoupling limit. We thus effectively use a model with one SM-like Higgs doublet; i.e., we only take into account one SM-like Higgs boson, ignoring effects due to scalars other than the LQ \u03d5, and appropriately rescale the effective parameters fij, dij, and eij, contained in the up-type quark, down-type quark and charged lepton mass matricesMu,Md, andMe, respectively. Since only in scenario B the results for quark mixing are in full agreement with experimental data, cf. Sec. III A 4, we focus on this scenario in the phenomenological study. For scenario A, we note that only the form of the effective parameters c21 and c31 is slightly different; see Sec. III C 2. According to the analytic results, the parameter c21 only contributes at SLO to \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei, see Sec. VA 5 and also Table V, while c31 is relevant for the computation of the secondary observable B \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd, compare Sec. VI E. We thus do not expect any significant differences in the phenomenological results for these two scenarios. This expectation is, indeed, confirmed with a smaller data sample of the first numerical scan."

For the first scan, discussed in Sec. V B, we only consider primary observables and thus, refer to it as the primary scan. Since the LQ couplings in the model span a parameter space of high dimensionality, it is reasonable to first establish which of the effective parameters prove most relevant for the induced phenomenology. The main purpose of constructing the model is generating textures of the LQ couplings, which are suitable to explain the currently observed flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de and in the AMM of the muon. So, as a first step, we deem it sufficient to only consider the effective parameters, contained in the LQ couplings x, y, and z, without making explicit reference to the interaction basis. We investigate the capability of the model to explain the mentioned anomalies and how the imposed current experimental bounds shape the viable parameter space. We also establish biases on the relevant effective parameters aij and bij that are applied in the second numerical scan; see Sec. VI B. The contributions to the relevant observables are computed with the help of the analytic expressions given in Appendix C. In addition, we use Wilson [100] to account for renormalization group (RG) running under QCD. For the second scan, detailed in Sec. VI, we take into account all observables, primary, secondary, and tertiary, and thus refer to it as comprehensive. In particular, we include secondary observables and outline how they can provide tangible signals for this model in the future; see Sec. VI F. Tertiary observables are also cross-checked, and\n075014-19\nthe generated ranges for these observables are summarized in Appendix E 3. In order to ensure that this model accommodates charged fermion masses and quark mixing, we fix the effective parameters fij, dij, and eij by performing a chi-squared fit; see details in Sec. VI A. Furthermore, we vary most of the effective parameters, contained in the LQ couplings x\u0302 and y\u0302, in the ranges laid out in Eqs. (60) and (61), apart from the ones that are identified as playing a dominant role for the phenomenology of the model. For these effective parameters, we apply a suitable biasing in order to more efficiently target the parameter space preferred by the primary observables, as detailed in Sec. VI B.

In the primary scan, employing the charged fermion mass basis, smaller ranges for the magnitudes of the effective parameters cB12, c\u0304, and c\u0303 are used in order to better approximate the relation of the LQ couplings x and z that is determined by the CKM mixing matrix; see Sec.

While the experimental limit on the BR of \u03bc \u2192 3e is currently less sensitive compared to the one on \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, the Mu3e experiment [120] is expected to provide a competitive sensitivity, i.e.,\njb13c23j\u2272 8><>: 0.298; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2 0.840; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4 1.61; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 6 9>=>;; \u00f080\u00de using the value given for phase 2; see Table IV.

Bc \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd\nIn this model, the LQ \u03d5 contributes to the leptonic decay Bc \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd and therefore, modifies the lifetime of the Bc meson via the process illustrated in the center of Fig. 1; see Ref. [134]. In line with this approach, we employ a constraint on the Bc lifetime in the SM in this work. We equate the measured decay width with the sum of the contributions of the SM and from the LQ \u03d5, i.e.,\n\u0393expBc \u00bc \u0393SMBc \u00fe \u0393 \u03d5 Bc : \u00f087\u00de\nHere, we fix \u03c4expBc \u00bc 1=\u0393 exp Bc \u00bc 0.510 0.009 ps [98] to the best-fit value while \u0393\u03d5Bc accounts for the tree-level process bc \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd induced by \u03d5.

(90) represents the contribution from the tau neutrino-antineutrino pair \u03bd\u03c4\u03bd\u03c4 in the final state, while the first two terms in the second line encode the contribution from the combination \u03bd\u03bc\u03bd\u03bc and, the rightmost terms contain the LFV contribution from the combinations \u03bd\u03c4\u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03bc\u03bd\u03c4. As the contributions to RH vector currents are negligible in this model, we have R\u03bdK \u00bc R\u03bdK\u22c6 , and thus, the more stringent experimental bound, R\u03bdK\u22c6 < 2.7 at 90% CL [123], acts as a primary constraint.\n8. Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4\nInducing sizeable contributions to b \u2192 c\u03c4\u03bd in this model, as discussed in Sec. VA 1, requires that the LQ coupling to the bottom quark and (in particular) the tau neutrino, encoded in a33, is enhanced. This effective parameter is related via the CKM mixing matrix to c33, which describes the coupling between the top quark and the tau lepton. Therefore, an explanation of the flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de may be associated with large corrections via a top-quark loop to Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4. These contributions are illustrated in Fig. 5. Following from Ref. [139], we parametrize these contributions by considering the effective axial-vector couplings of the Z boson to fermions, where the full\n075014-26\nexpressions for these can be found in Appendix C 4. At LO for the effective \u03c4\u03c4 coupling, Eq.

            "text": "Addressing the anomalies.\u2014The capability of this model to explain the anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and in the AMM of the muon, as found in the primary scan, is illustrated in Fig. 6. A priori, a value up to \u0394a\u03bc \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u22129 or larger can be achieved, depending on the LQmass, in accordance with the analytic estimate in Eq. (68) in the case of large LQ couplings. Still, after imposing the experimental bounds of all primary observables, a result of the order \u0394a\u03bc \u223c 10\u22129 is not generic, but instead we find a suppression by one or two orders of magnitude for about 90% of the viable sample points with positive \u0394a\u03bc generated in the primary scan, irrespective of the LQ mass. We remark that imposing these experimental bounds does not lead to a preference for either sign of \u0394a\u03bc, as is expected, since none of the primary observables exhibits a particular sensitivity to the phase of b23 or c23 \u2248 a23.\n21 Nevertheless, the results hint towards the possibility of explaining \u0394a\u03bc at the 2\u03c3 level or better in this model; see the top in Fig. 6. Furthermore, as expected from Eq. (68), i.e., \u0394a\u03bc \u221d jb23c23j, and R\u00f0D\u00f0\u22c6\u00de\u00de mainly controlled by ja33b32j, see Eqs. (66) and (67), these observables are a priori not (strongly) correlated in this model. The distribution of viable sample points in Fig. 6 is due to the experimental constraint on BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de; see Sec. V B 3 for more details. In particular, this entails a tension between explaining the flavor anomaly in R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de at the 3\u03c3 level or better and generating \u0394a\u03bc \u223c 10\u22129. Using FLAVIO [62\u201364] (since v2.0), one finds that the SM prediction R\u00f0D\u00deSM \u00bc 0.297 0.008 is compatible with the current experimental average at the 2\u03c3 level, that is, the anomaly is primarily constituted by the discrepancy between R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00deSM \u00bc 0.245 0.008 and the corresponding experimental value [19], which overlap only at\n20We remind that cij and cBij are in general two inequivalent sets of effective parameters; see Sec. III C 2.\n21As can be seen in Eq. (58), the effective parameters c23 and a23 as well as c33 and a33 agree up to O\u00f0\u03bb4\u00de, respectively. Since c23 and c33 are not varied directly in the primary scan, the implications for these are mainly discussed in terms of a23 and a33 in this section.\n075014-28\nthe 3\u03c3 level.22 Thus, a combined explanation of the anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and in the AMM of the muon at a confidence level of 3\u03c3 or better is challenging in the primary scan, in particular due to the correlation between the latter two observables. We refer to Sec. VI D for a revision of these trends.\nThe observables R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de are linearly correlated in the model by construction. As is visible in the bottom plot in Fig. 6, only in the case m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 6 a combined explanation of the anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de at the 1\u03c3 level is a priori impossible. Imposing the experimental bounds results in a quite pronounced correlation, namely R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de \u2248 0.30R\u00f0D\u00de\u00fe 0.15, and a combined explanation of R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de is possible at the 2\u03c3 level for all considered LQ masses.\nCorrelations between parameters.\u2014In order to substantiate these results, we have checked for all LQ couplings\n22Since the values for R\u00f0D\u00deSM and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00deSM that are generated by FLAVIO differ from those quoted in Ref. [19], the significances are not in exact correspondence with the ones in Table I.\n075014-29\nwhether they display some nontrivial correlation, if the flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de are explained, or in the case the measured value of the AMM of the muon is explained, assuming a certain confidence level in each case. For that purpose, we make use of an algorithm to calculate Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient, as provided by the library SEABORN [147]. The correlation plots in Fig. 7 show the effective parameters, separated in magnitude and argument, which display a nonzero correlation, if R\u00f0D\u00f0\u22c6\u00de\u00de (left) and \u0394a\u03bc (right) are explained, respectively. Here, all sample points for which the respective anomaly is explained are taken into account, regardless of whether all experimental bounds on the primary observables are respected or not. The effective parameter b13 is included as well for the sake of comparison, because it is sensitive to the experimental bounds. Its effects are detailed in Secs. V B 3 and V B 4. We have chosen m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4 and a certain confidence level as illustrative example. Nevertheless, the results are not appreciably different for the other considered LQ masses and confidence levels. A negative (positive) correlation is shown in blueish (reddish) color. The points entering the correlation plot for R\u00f0D\u00f0\u22c6\u00de\u00de and \u0394a\u03bc comprise roughly 10% and 15% of the entire sample for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4, respectively. As evidenced by the analytic estimates for R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de in Eqs. (66) and (67), the result for either observable is largely controlled by the product ja33b32j, which has to fall in an appropriate range to explain the anomalies. Furthermore, the arguments of the (complex) effective parameters a33 and b32 have to be positively correlated, implying that their difference should be close to zero, and\nthus, the cosines appearing in Eqs. (66) and (67) take values close to one. This shows that explaining the flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de requires the contribution linear in ja33b32j to be positive, that is, the contribution quadratic in ja33b32j is generically too small to yield a dominant effect. Similarly, as explaining the anomaly in the AMM of the muon needs positive \u0394a\u03bc, the difference of Arg\u00f0c23\u00de \u2248 Arg\u00f0a23\u00de and Arg\u00f0b23\u00de is necessarily close to \u03c0 so that the sign of the cosine appearing in Eq. (68) can cancel the negative overall sign. Thus, the right plot in Fig. 7 indicates a (moderate) negative correlation, both in the case of ja23j and jb23j as well as for the arguments. Note that the negative correlation of the magnitudes is less pronounced than in the case of ja33j and jb32j; see left plot in Fig. 7. We interpret this as being due to the fact that the product ja33b32j more directly determines the result for R\u00f0D\u00f0\u22c6\u00de\u00de, since there is not only the contribution arising from the interference with the SM, but also the (smaller) contribution proportional to ja33b32j2, which is unaffected by Arg\u00f0a33\u00de \u2212 Arg\u00f0b32\u00de, cf. Eqs. (66) and (67). For the dominant contribution to the AMM of the muon instead, a too large value of ja23b23j can be easily compensated by an appropriate value of Arg\u00f0a23\u00de \u2212 Arg\u00f0b23\u00de. Thus, in the case of the AMM of the muon, the sensitivities to the magnitudes and arguments of a23 and b23 are more similar."

            "text": "decays \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\nShaping the parameter space.\u2014We move on to the discussion of the primary observables acting as constraints on\n075014-30\nthe model, starting with the radiative cLFV decays \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3. The interplay between the corresponding BRs, R\u00f0D\u00f0\u22c6\u00de\u00de and \u0394a\u03bc is shown in Fig. 8. As is expected from the analytic estimates, there are correlations between these observables: BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de is intertwined with R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de via the effective parameter jc33j \u2248 ja33j, and with \u0394a\u03bc through jb23j, while the latter observable also largely depends on jc23j \u2248 ja23j, which is, on the other hand, constrained by the experimental bound on BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de; see Secs. VA 1\u2013VA 3. One typically generates large contributions to BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de, also depending on the LQ mass. Thus, this observable represents a strong constraint on the parameter space of this model. Still, the experimental bound on BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de can be easily saturated as well.\nThis implies that both the flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de can individually be explained at least at the 2\u03c3 level for all considered LQ masses, while passing the current experimental bound on BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de; see Fig. 8. Still, the result for R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de turns out to be always smaller than the experimental best-fit value. Note, though, that even in the case of a nonobservation of \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 at Belle II [115], an explanation of R\u00f0D\u00de within the 1\u03c3 level would still be possible, whereas an accommodation of the anomaly in R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de would be disfavored in that case. Furthermore, the shape of the viable parameter space in Fig. 6 can be understood by noticing the role of the experimental bound on BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de. As indicated in Sec. VA, the deviation of R\u00f0D\u00de=R\u00f0D\u00deSM and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de= R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00deSM from one can be approximated as a quadratic\n075014-31\nfunction in ja33j, respectively; see Eqs. (66) and (67). Together with \u0394a\u03bc \u221d jb23j, see Eq. (68), and the experimental bound on BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de constraining the product jb23c33j \u2248 jb23a33j according to Eq. (73), this bounds R\u00f0D\u00de=R\u00f0D\u00deSM and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de=R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00deSM from above as a function of \u0394a\u03bc. The upcoming searches for \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 [117] will both probe large parts of the currently viable parameter space. In particular, for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2 the search for \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 is expected to provide a relevant test for this model. The bottom-left plot in Fig. 8 also indicates that current data on \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 implies an upper limit on theAMMof themuon,\u0394a\u03bc \u2272 3 \u00d7 10\u22129, in this model. This can readily be recovered from combining the estimates in Eqs. (68) and (73) with the current experimental bound on BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de, BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00deexp < 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 [114]. In addition, both the future search for \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 at Belle II and the one for \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 at MEG II will test the capability of the model to explain the measured value of \u0394a\u03bc and potentially render an explanation of this flavor anomaly unlikely; see also discussion in Sec. VI D.\nCorrelations between parameters.\u2014We thus find that the available parameter space of this model is dominantly constrained by the experimental bounds on the radiative cLFV decays \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3. This is further evidenced by the correlation plot in Fig. 9, which shows the effective\nparameters that display nonzero correlations, if the experimental bounds of all primary constraints are imposed. As for the correlation plots discussed in Sec. V B 2, the LQ mass m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4 is chosen as illustrative example and the results are not appreciably different for the other considered LQ masses. We also include the effective parameter b32 in order to contrast the findings to the case of explaining the experimental anomalies in Fig. 7. Note that only 0.35% of the generated sample points respect all imposed bounds for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4 and thus constitute the plot in Fig. 9. Imposing an adequate negative correlation between the magnitudes ja23j and jb13j as well as ja33j and jb23j, respectively, is sufficient in the primary scan to render a sample point compatible with every experimental constraint taken into account. This is in very good agreement with the findings of Sec. VA 3. Generally, at least one of the two BRs, BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de and BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de, is larger than its corresponding current experimental bound in the primary scan, if a bound on one of the other primary constraints is violated. Thus, the latter appear to be considerably less competitive. Still, this observation is partly revised in Sec. VI D.\n4. Trilepton decays \u03bc \u2192 3e, \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc, \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bcee\u0304 and \u03bc\u2212 e conversion in aluminium\nIn this section, we discuss the findings of the primary scan for several cLFV trilepton decays and \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in aluminium.23\nThe results, shown in the left plot in Fig. 10, indicate that the reach of phase 2 of the Mu3e experiment [120] may render an explanation of the anomaly in the AMM of the muon in this model unlikely. The right plot in Fig. 10 verifies that \u03bc \u2192 3e is entirely dominated by long-range contributions from \u03b3-penguin diagrams. Thus, one can effectively establish a one-to-one correspondence with the BR of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 in the model, as stated in Sec. VA 4. If \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in nuclei was similarly dominated by long-range \u03b3-penguins, the plots in the top in Fig. 11 would also just feature a straight line in the center of the colored region. Due to subdominant contributions, see Sec. VA 5, the result can generically deviate from the \u03b3-penguin approximation by a factor of two or three. Still, the future search for \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in aluminium can be expected to complement the one for \u03bc \u2192 3e, as can be seen in the top-right plot in Fig. 11. The experiments\n23We note that, relatively independently of the target nucleus, the model can generate contributions ofO\u00f010\u221213\u00de to the respective CRs for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4 and 6, and contributions ofO\u00f010\u221212\u00de for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2. These are, however, ruled out due to the stringent bound on and the strong correlation with BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de in this regime. Thus, the current experimental bounds, CR\u00f0\u03bc \u2212 e;Ti\u00bdAu fPbg\u00deexp < 0.061\u00bd0.070 f4.6g \u00d7 10\u221211 [148\u2013150], do not impose relevant constraints on the model. In addition, the reach of future searches for \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in aluminium [121,122] is projected to be three to four orders of magnitude better than for carbon targets [151].\n075014-32\nCOMET [121] and Mu2e [122] are both projected to efficiently probe the possibility of explaining the measured value of \u0394a\u03bc in this model; see bottom plot in Fig. 11. In the following, we only discuss plots involving \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc. However, the obtained BRs for \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bcee\u0304 are almost identical in the primary scan, and thus, the inferred statements also apply to BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bcee\u0304\u00de. There can be, nevertheless, appreciable differences between the two in the comprehensive scan; see Sec. VI D 3. Figure 12 confirms that the upcoming search for \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc at Belle II [115] can be expected to probe a region of the parameter space, which is compatible with current constraints. As demonstrated in Sec. VA 4, this region corresponds to sufficiently large Z-penguin contributions. Indeed, if only long-range \u03b3-penguins were present, the top-left plot involving BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de would display a straight line located at the upper edge of the colored region. The hierarchy jc23j \u2248 ja23j \u226b jb23j required for large Z-penguin contributions also suppresses the product of the magnitudes of the two effective parameters and thus, the contribution to the AMM of the muon; see Eqs. (68) and (77). As a consequence, observing \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc at Belle II would indicate that an explanation of the measured value of \u0394a\u03bc is very unlikely for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4, 6. For these LQ masses, conversely, the largest contributions to \u0394a\u03bc are generated, if BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de remains below the prospective sensitivity. This upper bound on \u0394a\u03bc, \u0394a\u03bc \u221d jb23j, as a function of BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de, BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de \u221d jc33j2, is again mainly due to the experimental constraint on BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de, BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de \u221d jb23c33j2. In the model, a signal in \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc effectively enforces a signal in \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3, but the reverse is not true in general. Furthermore, the plots in the bottom of Fig. 12 suggest that\na result BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de\u2273O\u00f010\u221210\u00de becomes increasingly disfavored, if the contributions to cLFV \u03bc \u2212 e transitions shrink. Since jb13j\u2273 \u03bb in the primary scan, this shrinkage mostly relies on small values for jc23j \u2248 ja23j, see Secs. VA 3 and VA 5, and so the Z-penguin contributions to \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc become more suppressed. Hence, BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de is more tightly correlated with BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de in this case, and it is more difficult to respect the stringent experimental bound on the latter. In turn, if \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc is observable at Belle II, jc23j \u2248 ja23j must be rather large and therefore one generates an enhancement of BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de and CR\u00f0\u03bc \u2212 e;Al\u00de. Note that this interplay is far less pronounced in the comprehensive scan; see Sec. VI D."

As illustrated in Fig. 13, a large contribution from the LQ to the lifetime of the Bc meson is incompatible with the imposed experimental bounds.24 In particular, the model can accommodate the current best-fit value of R\u00f0D\u00deexp \u00bc 0.339 0.026 0.014, even if that contribution vanished.

In case of larger\n24We stress again that we have not attempted to perform a calculation of the SM contribution to the Bc lifetime but have indirectly inferred it from the requirement that the combined contribution from the SM and the LQ agrees with the experimentally determined lifetime.\n075014-33\nLQ masses, a substantial contribution to the lifetime of the Bc meson from the LQ only arises, if R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de become smaller than in the SM. This is in agreement with the opposite signs of the respective contributions linear in ja33b32j in the analytic estimates in Eqs. (66), (67), and (88). This interdependence can get (partly) lifted, if the channel with a muon neutrino \u03bd\u03bc in the final state becomes more relevant; see Sec. VI D for details. Nevertheless, a deviation of \u03c4SMBc from the best-fit value of \u03c4expBc by more than 10% is incompatible with the considered constraints. This implies that the BR for Bc \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd remains below 0.1 in most cases and can potentially exceed this limit only to a very small degree. In line with Eq. (89), imposing the upper bound BR\u00f0Bc \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd\u00de\u2272 0.1 constrains the SM contribution to the lifetime to fulfil \u03c4SMBc \u2272 0.55 ps, indicated by the hatched\nregion in the top and the bottom-left plot in Fig. 13. Therein, the vertical solid lines show the region in which the SM prediction agrees with the measured lifetime of the Bc meson at the 1\u03c3 level. Furthermore, we recall that BR\u00f0Bc \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd\u00de \u2272 0.3 corresponds to \u03c4SMBc \u2272 0.7 ps. If the measured value of \u0394a\u03bc is explained at the 3\u03c3 level or better in this model, we find that a substantial deviation of \u03c4SMBc from the measured Bc lifetime is very unlikely for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4, 6. This reflects the fact that an explanation of R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de competes with an explanation of \u0394a\u03bc; see Secs. V B 2 and V B 3. The results of the primary scan also suggest that R\u03bd\nK\u00f0\u22c6\u00de is close to one in that case. We refer\nto Sec. VI D for a discussion of the results of the comprehensive scan. Thus, the prospective measurement of B \u2192 K\u00f0\u22c6\u00de \u00fe invisible at Belle II [108] provides a promising avenue to test this model, since the primary\n075014-34\nscan prompts the expectation that the nonappearance of a substantial excess on top of the SM expectation implies the best chances for an explanation of the observed anomaly in the AMM of the muon. As is the case for R\u00f0D\u00de=R\u00f0D\u00deSM and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de=R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00deSM, the observables R\u03bd K\u00f0\u22c6\u00de and \u03c4 SM Bc\n=\u03c4expBc can also be approximated as quadratic functions in ja33j, respectively, and are therefore correlated with \u0394a\u03bc, \u0394a\u03bc \u221d jb23j, via the experimental bound on BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de, BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de \u221d ja33b23j2; see the relevant estimates in Sec. VA. As evidenced in Fig. 14, the contributions to the AMM of the muon, \u0394a\u03bc \u221d ja23b23j, and g\u03c4A=gSMA are not per se correlated, as is expected from Eq. (92) according to which the difference of g\u03c4A=g SM A from one is essentially only\ncontrolled by jc33j \u2248 ja33j. Still, if the experimental constraints of all primary observables are imposed, the axialvector coupling of Z bosons to tau leptons is necessarily SM-like, if the measured value of \u0394a\u03bc is explained at the 3\u03c3 level. In particular, the deviation from LFU would be constrained to be much smaller than 0.1%. This correlation is established through the bound on BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de, BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de \u221d ja33b23j2, which is illustrated by the right plot in Fig. 14. It is clearly visible that a deviation of g\u03c4A=g SM A from the current experimental average [109,124] by more than 2\u03c3 is incompatible with the constraint on BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de. Furthermore, the future search for \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 at Belle II [115] can conclusively test the capability of the model to induce a significant deviation from LFU in axial-vector couplings.\n075014-35"

As discussed in Sec. III, accommodating quark mixing correctly requires to consider scenario B, i.e., the up-type quark mass matrix has to be of the form given in Eq. (26). As the mass of the LQ is selected to be maximally a few TeV, see Eq. (62), we fit the\ncharged fermion masses at a scale of \u03bc \u00bc 1 TeV, taken from Ref. [99]. Quark mixing is fitted to the best-fit values given by the PDG (Particle Data Group) [98], because RG running effects are small. This model contains two Higgs doublets, Hu giving masses to up-type quarks and Hd giving masses to downtype quarks as well as charged leptons. The suppression of the down-type quark and charged lepton masses with respect to those of the up-type quarks (in particular, the top quark) is achieved by taking the VEV of Hd to be much smaller than that of Hu\u2014recall Eq. (13). Thus, in the chisquared fit we have (mainly) varied the size of the VEVof Hd such that hH0di takes a minimum value of 1.22 GeVand a maximum value of 4.86 GeV, generating several viable datasets. Each of these leads to an excellent fit to the charged fermion masses taken at \u03bc \u00bc 1 TeV [99] and to quark mixing [98]. From these datasets, we also extract the unitary matrices Ld, Rd, Le, Re, Lu, and Ru, necessary in order to compute the form of the LQ couplings x\u0302 and y\u0302 in the charged fermion mass basis, i.e., the LQ couplings x, y, and z, according to Eqs.

These points have been filtered to select only those that pass the primary constraints in Table IV, including g\u03c4A=g SM A at the 3\u03c3 level and \u03c4SMBc at the 1\u03c3 level.\n25A comprehensive discussion can be found in Ref. [152].\n075014-37\nIn an unbiased scan, it turns out to be difficult to find points capable of addressing the three flavor anomalies, while passing the constraints arising from the experimental bounds on the radiative cLFV decays \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3. From Table V, it becomes evident why, since common effective parameters drive these observables, recalling that aij and cij are related via the CKM mixing matrix. For this reason, the biases in Table VI are presented for points satisfying all primary constraints, together with two further numerical restrictions; see Eqs. (100) and (101). The latter intend to address the constraints from \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 by biasing the values of the magnitudes of the effective parameters b23 and b13, respectively. For a value of the magnitude of the effective parameter a23 chosen according to Table VI, we also impose a restriction on the magnitude of b13 in order to pass the experimental bound on the BR of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3, see Eq. (72),\njb13j\u2272 1ja23j 8><>: 0.41; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2 1.16; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4 2.22; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 6 9>=>;: \u00f0100\u00de Furthermore, respecting the experimental constraint on the BR of \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 enforces that, once a value for the magnitude of a33 is chosen according to Table VI, the magnitude of b23 is restricted such that\njb23j\u2272 1ja33j 8><>: 0.16; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2 0.45; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4 0.86; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 6 9>=>;; \u00f0101\u00de compare Eq. (73). This means that determining whether a sample point can rather explain the flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00f0\u22c6\u00de\u00de, for which ja33j needs to be quite large, or in the AMM of the muon, for which jb23j must be quite large, is tightly controlled by the bound on the BR of \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3. The ranges for ja33j indicated in Table VI are the union of the\nranges separately extracted using the 3\u03c3 ranges of R\u00f0D\u00f0\u22c6\u00de\u00de and of the AMM of the muon. Note that these constraints are imposed on the effective parameters in the charged fermion mass basis, while scanning over effective parameters in the interaction basis in the comprehensive scan. Therefore, we have two related, but distinctly defined, regions of parameter space. The transformations between them are given by the unitary matrices, generated by the chi-squared fit to charged fermion masses and quark mixing, as described in Sec. VI A. As addressed in Sec. IV, varying the effective parameters in the interaction basis in the range found in Eq. (60) ensures the preservation of the expansion in orders of \u03bb used to construct the underlying model. In doing so, the corresponding effective parameters in the charged fermion mass basis, calculated from this scan, may fall outside the range \u00bd\u03bb; 1=\u03bb , compare Table X in Appendix E 1. For practicality in implementing the biases, we assume that the LO relations listed in Appendix B can be used to translate between the two bases. In particular, we first assume that\nja33j\u00bc ja\u030233j; jb32j\u00bc jb\u030232j; and jb23j\u00bc jb\u030223j; \u00f0102\u00de\nwhich allows us to directly bias the input values for ja\u030233j; jb\u030232j, and jb\u030223j. All other effective parameters in the interaction basis are varied in the ranges, specified by Eqs. (60) and (61). We then bias the magnitudes of a23 and b13 by first extracting their values from the effective parameters in the interaction basis, using the aforementioned unitary matrices, and afterwards enforcing the bounds shown in Table VI and Eq. (100), respectively. For further details regarding the implementation of the scan, see Appendix E 1. We do not claim to have extensively explored the entire multidimensional parameter space of this model but implement the biases from the primary scan to better identify regions capable of explaining the three flavor anomalies and respecting all considered present constraints.\n075014-38"

Therefore, in the comprehensive scan, the percentage of viable points has particularly increased for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2. Below, we discuss the efficacy of this biased scan for addressing the flavor anomalies and evading constraints.

These points are illustrated by white crosses in the plots, as mentioned in Sec. VI C.26\nThe difference in the parameter space probed by the primary and the comprehensive scan, in turn, impacts the resultant ranges of the observables. This may occur due to modifying the sampled region for a particular effective parameter that enters in a dominant contribution according to Sec. VA (e.g., smaller accessible values of the magnitude of b13, discussed in Sec. VI D 2) or through an enhancement of the effective parameters appearing as subdominant in the primary scan (e.g. enhancement of\nLFV contributions in processes with neutrinos in the final state, see Sec. VI D 4). Each of these may be a result of biasing and/or the use of a different basis. We emphasize that for the plots contained in this section, used to contrast the two scans, the colored points always represent those for which all primary constraints are satisfied. Constraints from secondary and tertiary observables are automatically fulfilled after imposing all primary constraints. Table VII contains a summary of the spread of the numerical results for the primary observables. Regarding the computation of the primary observables, we directly employ the analytic expressions for the trilepton decays, i.e., for BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de, BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bcee\u0304\u00de, and BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 3e\u00de, from Appendix C 2 d, and for Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 from Appendix C 4. So for these observables the calculation method is the same as in the primary scan in Sec. V. For the other primary observables, the method is different compared to the scan in Sec. V, since we numerically calculate R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and R\u03bdK\u22c6 using the Wilson coefficients in Appendix C 3, the Wilson package [100], and FLAVIO [62,63]. Furthermore, we compute \u0394a\u03bc, BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de, BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de, and CR\u00f0\u03bc \u2212 e;Al\u00de using SARAH and SPheno [101,102]. For Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4, we do not find a discernible difference between the distributions of data from the primary and the comprehensive scan. We thus refer to Sec. V B 5 for a discussion of the results. We, however, display the output for Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4, when discussing the secondary observable g\u03bcA=g SM A in Sec. VI F."

            "text": "Before comparing the results of the primary and the comprehensive scan, we first comment on some important differences between the outputs of the primary scan, discussed in Sec. V, and the comprehensive one, discussed in this section. In Table X in Appendix E 1, we list the distributions of the unhatted LQ couplings extracted from the comprehensive scan. In this way, we can identify the effective parameters, whose magnitude can be (much) smaller than \u03bb, e.g., jb13j, or (much) larger than 1=\u03bb, e.g., ja22j, i.e., the region sampled in the primary scan. This difference impacts the distribution of the observables influenced by these parameters. We look at the effective parameters that dominantly drive the analytic estimates for the primary observables, listed in Table V. We note that there is complementary influence of the effective parameters b13 and a23 via the constraints from \u03bc \u2192 e processes, especially BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de. We also see from Table V that the effective parameter b23 is responsible for the dominant contributions to both the AMM of the muon and to cLFV tau decays, especially BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de. Therefore, as discussed in Sec. V, the magnitude of b23 should not be too large. Table X shows that b13 can take particularly small values in the comprehensive scan, which means that sampled points with larger values of c23 \u2248 a23 are capable 26As most of these points correspond to m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2, we do not distinguish between LQ masses for the white crosses.\n075014-39\nof avoiding constraints from \u03bc \u2192 e processes; see Eq. (100). These larger values of the magnitude of a23 then require smaller b23 in order to generate large \u0394a\u03bc compatible with the experimental indication. At the same time, large contributions to the BR of \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 are avoided. This makes the comprehensive scan more likely to identify a larger sample of viable points consistent with reconciling\nthe observed anomaly in the AMM of the muon\u2014which is a challenge for the primary scan. Furthermore, we note several instances in which the differences in the two scans result in an amplification of a contribution to a primary observable, identified as subdominant in Sec. V. Interestingly, this is relevant for the case of LFV contributions to decays with neutrinos in the\n075014-40\nfinal state, including R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, \u03c4Bc , and R\u03bdK\u22c6 . As we have seen, cLFV can be considerable in this model, and it is thus reasonable to expect similar violation in decays involving neutrinos. We discuss the features mentioned above and other differences between the results of these two scans in the following. Throughout this section, we use the term \u201cviable\u201d to denote points that are capable of passing all constraints but not necessarily addressing the three flavor anomalies. For instance, all data points displayed in plots in this section are viable points."

Indeed, the data reveal that, with the correlation between R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de accommodated, the anomalies in these two observables and the measured value of \u0394a\u03bc can be explained at the 2\u03c3 level for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2 (see dark-colored points in the top-right plot in Fig. 15). Note that the latter cannot be explicitly seen in the bottom in Fig. 15, because the \u03c3-regions about the best-fit values of R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de do not consider the correlation between these two observables. If we only look at the flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, all three considered LQ masses are compatible with viable solutions at the 2\u03c3 level (see top-left plot in Fig. 15). This is also found in the primary scan in Sec. V. In case the best-fit values remain the same and the Belle II Collaboration increases the precision with which they\ncan probe these observables [112], the prospective 3\u03c3 contour assuming 5 ab\u22121 of data is shown in the top in Fig. 15 as black dashed ellipse.27 We, therefore, expect that future measurements of R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de at Belle II will provide an important test of this model. We also recognize that the LQ masses we have shown to be viable to explain the anomalies are likely within the reach of upcoming LQ direct-production searches at the LHC. Furthermore, we indicate the prospects for future measurements of the AMM of the muon. In the bottom in Fig. 15, the 3\u03c3 projected sensitivity from the Muon g \u2212 2 experiment [113] is seen to (roughly) overlay the present 2\u03c3 region for this observable. If, as we have illustrated here, the best-fit value remains the same and the sensitivity is improved, this will challenge the model as an explanation of the three anomalies but not entirely rule out the viable parameter space. This is consistent with the preceding discussion and is evident from the distribution of white crosses in the plots in Fig. 15.\nSimultaneously addressing all three anomalies.\u2014In the primary scan, it is found to be difficult to identify points that can address all three flavor anomalies simultaneously. A key limiting factor is the interplay between large contributions to the AMM of the muon and large contributions to the radiative cLFV processes \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3. Here, we discuss how this limitation is relaxed in the comprehensive scan.\n27In generating this projected Belle II chi-squared ellipse, we have assumed the same correlation coefficient and best-fit value as reported for the HFLAV averages in 2021 [19].\n075014-41\nWe first analytically show that the maximum value of the AMM of the muon compatible with the primary constraints is (roughly) inversely proportional to the magnitude of the effective parameter b13. Recall from the estimate in Eq. (68) that\nj\u0394a\u03bcj\u2272 jb23c23jm\u03022\u03d5 \u00d7 10 \u22129: \u00f0103\u00de\nThe present bound on the combination jb13c23j from BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de, see Eq. (74), can be used to parametrize the dependence on jb13j for a viable point. We can also bound the magnitude of b23 (roughly) from above by considering the dominant contribution to BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de, see Eq. (75), which is proportional to jb23c33j, and using the minimum sampled value of the magnitude of c33 \u2248 a33 from Table VI. Therefore, an approximate upper bound for the maximally accessible value of j\u0394a\u03bcj for each LQ mass can be expressed as\nj\u0394a\u03bcj\u2272 1jb13j 8><>: 0.249; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2 0.993; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4 2.236; m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 6 9>=>; \u00d7 10\u22129: \u00f0104\u00de This inverse correlation between the maximum value of j\u0394a\u03bcj and the magnitude of the effective parameter b13 is also influenced by the biasing procedure, which aims to target points that avoid constraints from the two radiative cLFV decays \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 using Eqs. (100) and (101). The influence of biasing the effective parameters and the distribution of those dominating the contributions to radiative cLFV decays are illustrated in the top in Fig. 16. The top-left plot shows the distribution of values of the magnitude of b13 accessible in the primary and the comprehensive scan. Whereas the minimum value for jb13j is seen to be as small asO\u00f010\u22123\u00de in the comprehensive scan, the primary scan only employs values larger than \u03bb \u2248 0.22. From Eq. (104), we therefore expect larger accessible values of the AMM of the muon, while, at the same time, evading the primary constraints. This is, indeed, the case as shown in the bottom in Fig. 16, where we show the distribution of \u0394a\u03bc plotted against the value of jb13j. This effect is especially striking for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2, for which the only points that explain the observed anomaly in \u0394a\u03bc within the 3\u03c3 range are found outside the gray shaded region, i.e., the sampled region of the magnitude of b13 in the primary scan. We note that in the bottom in Fig. 16 we also overlay as dot-dashed lines the upper bound for each LQ mass, as shown in Eq. (104). We see reasonable agreement with the data, given that this upper bound has been derived under the assumption that the magnitudes of both a33 and b23 lie in the interval \u00bd\u03bb; 1=\u03bb , which is,\nhowever, not always fulfilled in the comprehensive scan, compare top-right plot in Fig. 16."

Appealing to the analytic formulas in Eqs. (66) and (67), we see that the contribution from the LFV final state with a muon neutrino is proportional to ja23b32j. We recall that the magnitude of a23 is biased towards larger values, see Table VI, and we thus expect non-negligible contributions from this decay channel to R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de in the comprehensive scan. Even though this LFV channel does not interfere with the SM contribution, for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2, it can generate an enhancement above the SM value as large as 40% for R\u00f0D\u00de and 30% for R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, respectively, using all viable points. For m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4, 6 there is at most a 10% enhancement in either observable above the SM value, which is roughly consistent with the present 1\u03c3 margin about the best-fit values. Therefore, we emphasize that this effect cannot be neglected, when considering these observables in this model, particularly as future experiments will reach increased sensitivity. In Sec. V B 3, it is shown that the strongest present experimental constraints on this model arise from the radiative cLFV decays \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3. In the following, we discuss the differences between the results of the primary and the comprehensive scan for these and other leptonic primary constraints as well as the prospects that these processes offer as signals of this model at future experiments.\nRadiative charged lepton flavor violating decays.\u2014In Fig. 17, we show the impact of biasing on the parameter space in the case of the radiative cLFV decays \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3. The upper bounds from Eqs. (100) and (101) are shown as vertical dot-dashed lines. Since in the comprehensive scan the magnitude of the effective parameter b13 can be significantly lower than \u03bb, also the attained values of the product ja23b13j can be smaller than naively expected, compare colored points and gray shaded region in the left plot in Fig. 17. This product being smaller generally corresponds to a suppressed value of BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de, consistent with the analytic estimate in Eq. (72).We see that a signal of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 is predicted to be observed at MEG II [117] for a large number of viable points, in agreement with the findings of the primary scan; see Sec. V B 3. Nevertheless, there are points capable of addressing all three flavor anomalies that remain unconstrained by this observable even with the increased sensitivity. Similarly, we note that the magnitude of the effective parameter a33 can be smaller than \u03bb, see top-right plot in Fig. 16, though to a lesser extent than in the case of b13.\n075014-42\nWe thus expect points in the right plot in Fig. 17 to fall below the gray shaded region for the product ja33b23j. Smaller accessible values of a33 imply viable points with larger magnitude of b23, although we see that the present bound from BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de is already very constraining on this product. Furthermore, we note that the majority of points able to address the three anomalies, i.e., the white crosses, lead to a value for BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de in the region that can be probed by the future sensitivity of Belle II [115]. Finally, we mention that the distributions for these radiative cLFV decays with respect to R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de and the AMM of the muon can be found in Fig. 26 in Appendix E 2. They can be compared with Fig. 8 in Sec. V B 3.\nTrilepton tau decays.\u2014We discuss the results for the primary constraints BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de and BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bcee\u0304\u00de in the comprehensive scan. The relationship between these two observables is displayed in the top-left plot in Fig. 18. Unlike in the primary scan in Sec. V, we in general do not find that BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de \u2248 BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bcee\u0304\u00de; i.e., Eq. (81) does not hold for the shown data. This is due to the impact of subdominant contributions to both processes, including the Z-penguin contributions explicitly detailed in Eqs. (77) and (78), as well as subleading contributions to both processes, e.g., contributions due to box diagrams as discussed in Appendix C 2. We show the relation given in Eq. (81), reflecting \u03b3-penguin dominance, as an overlaid purple dot-dashed line. We note that there is a strong\n075014-43\npositive correlation between the observables but also a spread influenced nontrivially by these subdominant contributions. Therefore, both observables should be separately considered with respect to the future prospects for signals at Belle II [115]. Next, we would like to contrast the results for BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de with those of the primary scan. In the topright plot in Fig. 18, we show BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de plotted against BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de. The overlaid purple dot-dashed line shows the estimate from Eq. (79), i.e., the linear correlation between BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de and BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de in the case of \u03b3-penguin dominance. Comparing this plot with the corresponding one in Fig. 12, we notice a large number of points, particularly for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2, that result in a value for BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de that can be probed at Belle II, unlike in the case of the primary scan. This includes a sizeable number of the white crosses, points capable of addressing all three anomalies, which motivates further examination of this difference. The explanation of this difference lies in the relevance of Z- and \u03b3-penguin contributions to BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de. Equation (77) reveals that both contributions are proportional to jc33j \u2248 ja33j, and also to jc23j \u2248 ja23j (Z-penguin) or jb23j (\u03b3-penguin), respectively. Smaller \u03b3-penguin contributions correspond to smaller values of BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de, see Eq. (73), and are thus preferred in the comprehensive scan due to the biasing, compare Eq. (101). Therefore, in order to generate a significant contribution to the AMM of the muon larger values of the magnitude of the effective parameter a23 \u2248 c23 are needed; see Eq. (68) and Table VI. This, in turn, typically enhances the Z-penguin contributions to BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de. From Eq. (77), we can derive the value of the ratio jb23=c23j at which the dominant\ncontribution changes. This is illustrated as a purple dotdashed line in the bottom-left plot in Fig. 18. Consistent with the preceding discussion, we see that points preferred by explaining the flavor anomalies overwhelmingly correspond to those which have values of jb23=c23j in the range of Z-penguin dominance. In the bottom-right plot in Fig. 18, we also see that, indeed, the same points correspond to significant contributions to \u0394a\u03bc. Furthermore, we notice in the bottom-right plot in Fig. 18 a prominent feature, namely a diagonal cutoff towards the top-right corner of the plot for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4, 6, which is not present for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2. In Sec. V B 4, this feature has been associated with the inverse proportionality of the maximum contributions to BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de and \u0394a\u03bc, at LO. In the topright plot in Fig. 12, we observe this cutoff for all three sampled LQ masses, although less clearly for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2. For larger LQ masses, subdominant contributions, particularly to BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de and BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de, are more suppressed by the LQ mass, and consequently this cutoff is more pronounced. For m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2, such contributions enter and weaken the mentioned inverse proportionality\u2014leading to the observed spread of points towards the top-right corner of the plot. In summary, the observed anomaly in the AMM of the muon can be explained, while potentially large signals for both \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bcee\u0304 can be observed at Belle II. These signals are driven by largish Z-penguin contributions that, unlike contributions due to \u03b3-penguins, are not constrained by correspondingly large contributions to BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de. The correlation between larger BRs for trilepton tau decays and sizeable values of the AMM of the muon is enhanced by the biasing, and particularly by the increase in sampled viable points with a large magnitude of the effective parameter a23, as discussed in Sec. VI D 2.\n075014-44\nFurther \u03bc \u2192 e processes.\u2014With smaller values of the magnitude of the effective parameter b13, see top-left plot in Fig. 16, in particular the white crosses, we can also access smaller values of the observables dominantly driven by this parameter. These include, as we can see from Table V, BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de, CR\u00f0\u03bc \u2212 e;Al\u00de, and BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 3e\u00de. Although smaller b13 allows us to evade present constraints, it does not exclude these channels as means to test this model at future experiments. As the prospects for BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de are already discussed, we focus in the following on the other two processes. From Table VII, we see that on average BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 3e\u00de \u223cO\u00f010\u221215\u00de, which is an order of magnitude larger than the projected sensitivity of phase 2 of the Mu3e experiment [120]. Still, we find points that can evade this constraint, even with the future sensitivity,\nincluding the ones that are capable of addressing the three flavor anomalies. Similarly, we have on average CR\u00f0\u03bc \u2212 e;Al\u00de \u223cO\u00f010\u221216\u00de, which is an order of magnitude larger than the future projections for COMET [121] and Mu2e [122]. Compellingly, in Fig. 19, we see that all white crosses, associated with points that can explain the three flavor anomalies at the 3\u03c3 level or better, are within the region of parameter space probed by either future search for \u03bc \u2212 e conversion in aluminium. Therefore, we predict a signal to be observed for this process. Note that the same proportionality between CR\u00f0\u03bc \u2212 e;Al\u00de and BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de is found in the comprehensive scan as in the primary scan, illustrated in Fig. 11. So, the upper bound on CR\u00f0\u03bc \u2212 e;Al\u00de, seen in Fig. 19, stems from respecting the present constraint on BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de.\n075014-45\nFurthermore, we comment on the relation between \u03bc \u2192 e processes and BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de in this model. This is a continuation of the discussion found in Sec. V B 4, in which it is noted that large BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de, observable at Belle II, is much less likely, if contributions to \u03bc \u2192 e processes are beyond the reach of future experiments. This relation is found to be less pronounced in the comprehensive scan, because smaller values of the rates of \u03bc \u2192 e processes can be generally reached, given that their dominant contributions are proportional to the magnitude of b13. As this effective parameter can take much smaller values in the comprehensive scan, larger values of the magnitude of a23 \u2248 c23 become allowed that can enhance Z-penguin contributions to BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc\u00de. This explains the existence of viable points towards the bottom-right corner in Fig. 19, not observed in the corresponding plot of the primary scan; see Fig. 12. We notice that the plots for BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 3e\u00de and BR\u00f0\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3\u00de reveal a behavior very similar to the one for CR\u00f0\u03bc \u2212 e;Al\u00de, shown in Fig. 19."

            "text": "In the primary scan in Sec. V, the behavior of the hadronic observables R\u03bdK\u22c6 and \u03c4Bc , the Bc lifetime, is explored. Notably, both of these observables involve neutrinos in the final state. Naively, one may be tempted to consider only contributions for which lepton flavor is conserved, since these lead to interference with the corresponding SM contributions. However, as pointed out for R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de in Sec. VI D 2, the contributions from\nLFV channels are found to be non-negligible in the comprehensive scan. We discuss these and other differences between the primary and the comprehensive scan for R\u03bdK\u22c6 and \u03c4Bc in the following.\nContributions to observable R\u03bdK\u22c6 .\u2014From Sec. V B 5, we expect the constraint on BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de, whose dominant contribution is driven by the product jb23c33j, to impact the size of the main contributions to R\u03bdK\u22c6 , driven by the magnitude of a33 \u2248 c33, and to the AMM of the muon, depending dominantly on the magnitude of b23; see Table V. This correlation is visible to a certain extent in the primary scan; see bottom-right plot in Fig. 13. In the comprehensive scan, the relation between the effective parameters a33 and b23 is further enhanced by the biasing; see Eq. (101). Thus, the observed correlation is apparent in the top-left plot in Fig. 20, in particular for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 4 and m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 6. As can be seen, the majority of points that imply values for R\u03bdK\u22c6 close to its present bound corresponds to smaller values of \u0394a\u03bc. This trend seems absent for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2, as we discuss in the following. In order to understand the distribution of values for R\u03bdK\u22c6 in the comprehensive scan, we first recall that the dominant contribution in the model has \u03bd\u03c4\u03bd\u03c4 in the final state, see Eq. (90), and is determined by the product ja33a32j. In the top-right plot in Fig. 20, we see that there is, indeed, a strong correlation between larger values of the magnitude of a32 and large values for R\u03bdK\u22c6. Numerically we find that ja32j can be as large asO\u00f010\u00de, see Table X in Appendix E 1. This can be traced back to a potentially large additional contribution to the effective parameter a32, originating from the transformation from the interaction to the charged fermion mass basis, compare Eq. (B6) in Appendix B. At the same time, we see in the bottom-left plot in Fig. 20 that the biasing prefers smaller values of ja33j \u2248 jc33j for smaller LQ masses, see also Table VI, and that most white crosses also correspond to smaller ja33j. For these smaller values, larger values of the magnitude of b23 are likely to be compatible with the present bound from BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de, compare Eq. (73). These larger values of jb23j tend to increase \u0394a\u03bc, see Eq. (68), and can push it closer to the present best-fit value. Altogether, we can generally expect larger contributions to R\u03bdK\u22c6 to be accessible for \u03bd\u03c4\u03bd\u03c4 in the final state than in the primary scan, see Sec. V B 5. However, for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2 smaller values of ja33j are usually attained, as we see from the bottom-left plot in Fig. 20. Nevertheless, large values for R\u03bdK\u22c6 can be obtained. From Eq. (90), we note that there can be sizeable contributions from the channel with \u03bd\u03bc\u03bd\u03bc in the final state which are proportional to the product ja23a22j as well as LFV contributions having \u03bd\u03bc\u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd\u03c4\u03bd\u03bc in the final state that are driven by ja23a32j and ja33a22j, respectively. In the comprehensive scan, we find that the magnitude of a22 can be as large as O\u00f010\u00de, see bottom-right plot in\n075014-46\nFig. 20 and Table X in Appendix E 1. At the same time, larger values of the magnitude of a23 are preferred by the biasing; see Table VI. Therefore, the contribution with \u03bd\u03bc\u03bd\u03bc in the final state becomes more significant for R\u03bdK\u22c6 in comparison to the primary scan. This argument is supported by the positive correlation in the data between large ja22j and larger R\u03bdK\u22c6, shown in the bottom-right plot in Fig. 20. Additionally, the LFV contributions with \u03bd\u03bc\u03bd\u03c4 and \u03bd\u03c4\u03bd\u03bc in the final state can also be relevant, particularly the one driven by larger values of the product ja23a32j. For the other contribution proportional to the product ja33a22j, the biasing prefers smaller values of ja33j, see Table VI and bottom-left plot in Fig. 20,\nespecially for smaller LQ masses, so that we do not expect it to be equally important. In summary, the current constraint on R\u03bdK\u22c6 is found to genuinely shape the viable parameter space, and the prospective measurement of B \u2192 K\u00f0\u22c6\u00de \u00fe invisible at Belle II [108] provides a promising avenue to test this model.\nLifetime of Bc meson.\u2014For this observable, we similarly find differences between the values obtained in the comprehensive and the primary scan. While a substantial contribution to the Bc lifetime is associated with values of R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de below their SM predictions in the primary scan, see top in Fig. 13 and discussion in\n075014-47\nSec. V B 5, in the comprehensive scan, especially for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2, points are observed that are in disagreement with this statement and therefore hint at the influence of subdominant contributions. This can be explicitly seen in the top in Fig. 21. Equation (88) shows that the dominant term for the inferred SM contribution to the Bc lifetime, inferred \u03c4SMBc , is driven by the product ja33b32j, which corresponds to the tau neutrino being in the final state and which interferes with the SM contribution. From the bottom-left plot in Fig. 21, we see that this product is sampled over a much smaller range for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2 than for the other LQ masses, due to the biasing imposed; see Table VI. However, for small values\nof this product, larger values of the inferred \u03c4SMBc are nevertheless accessible. This indicates the relevance of subdominant contributions. The other contribution, mentioned in Eq. (88), is proportional to the product ja23b32j, and corresponds to the muon neutrino in the final state. One should recall that the magnitude of a23 \u2248 c23 needs to be quite large to explain the observed anomaly in \u0394a\u03bc and that we sample more viable points with such larger values due to the biasing, see Table VI. We thus can expect an enhancement of this LFV contribution to the inferred \u03c4SMBc \u2014similarly to the effect found for R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, see Sec. VI D 2. For m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2, we see from the bottom in Fig. 21 that a sizeable fraction of the points that correspond\n075014-48\nto small values of the product ja33b32j and larger inferred \u03c4SMBc also leads to a larger value for the AMM of the muon, compare especially the white crosses. Despite the differences found in the results of the primary and the comprehensive scan, this model still predicts BR\u00f0Bc \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd) to be below 0.1. More precise measurements of Bc \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd could provide a further test of this model, in particular, when considering the complementarity with measurements of R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de."

In fact, they correspond to the real and imaginary part of the same effective vertex, as can be seen from Eq. (C19) in Appendix C 2. As we generate large contributions to the AMMof themuon andwe allow for complex values for the LQ couplings, we expect that this model can lead to sizeable values for the EDM of the muon. Similar to the AMM of the muon, most relevant is the contribution in which a chirality flip occurs via a mass insertion on the internal quark line and which can thus be enhanced by the mass of the top quark.

While this signal could not be seen at the Muon g \u2212 2 experiment at Fermilab, some parameter space is expected to be probed at the muEDM experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) and similar experiments using the frozenspin technique, as indicated by the black dashed lines in the top-left plot in Fig. 22. We remind that a bias for the difference of the arguments of the effective parameters a23 \u2248 c23 and b23 is employed, see Table VI, such that more sizeable contributions to the AMM of the muon, and thus,\n075014-50\na larger real part of the relevant Wilson coefficient, are generated. Therefore, we expect the comprehensive scan to prefer smaller values of the imaginary part of the product of the same effective parameters; see Eq. (105). This, in turn, leads to a distribution of values of jd\u03bcj below the analytic estimate ofO\u00f010\u221222\u00de e cm. Still, enhanced contributions to both observables are seen to be compatible, and so this effect is limited. Furthermore, note that we do not observe any preference for the sign of the EDM of the muon. Given that the contributions to it turn out to be suppressed relative to present constraints, there is no need for an additional CP symmetry to restrict its size. Turning to the effective coupling of Z bosons to muons,\nwe first repeat that according to the analytic estimate the\ndominant contribution to the ratio g\u03bcA=g SM A is proportional to jc23j2 and negative such that the resulting value of g\u03bcA=g SM A should always be smaller than one in this model; see Eq. (106). This is consistent with the data, illustrated in the top-right plot in Fig. 22. Then, we remind that the comprehensive scan prefers larger values of the magnitude of a23 \u2248 c23, since this increases the chances to satisfactorily address the flavor anomalies. Such larger values correspond to points with a smaller ratio g\u03bcA=g SM A , as observed in the distribution of white crosses in the topright plot in Fig. 22. Present constraints are not competitive enough to be illustrated in this plot, although the present best-fit value may hint at contributions beyond the SM that generate a ratio g\u03bcA=g SM A smaller than one. From the\n075014-51\ntop-right plot in Fig. 22, we see that increased precision will allow us to probe parts of the viable parameter space of this model. Note that we use the projected ILC bounds [110], but a further reduction of the error by a factor of ten is expected from the FCC [111]. For completeness, a plot showing the EDM of the muon and the ratio g\u03bcA=g SM A can be found in the left plot in Fig. 27 in Appendix E 2. Lastly, we observe no correlation between g\u03bcA=g SM A and g\u03c4A=g SM A . This is expected from the analytic estimates, see Eqs. (92) and (106), since these ratios dominantly depend on distinct effective parameters. The regions of the two ratios in the comprehensive scan are displayed in the bottom plot in Fig. 22 for the three different LQ masses and result from the biasing imposed on the effective parameters a23 \u2248 c23 and a33 \u2248 c33, respectively; see Table VI."

We note that the effective parameters b22 and c22 \u2248 a22, which enter the estimates for these observables, can be O\u00f010\u00de in the comprehensive scan, see Table X in Appendix E 1, while a23 is biased towards larger values; see Table VI.

In the right plot in Fig. 23, we illustrate this observable plotted against R\u00f0D\u00de. As one can see, we find no correlation between these two observables. A plot for R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de shows a similar result and can be found in the right plot in Fig. 27 in Appendix E 2. We note that the scalar-operator contribution to this observable remains suppressed by the size of the coupling y31 \u00bc b31\u03bb5, see Eq. (56), consistent with the analytic estimate in Sec.

This is not sufficient to make the scalar-operator contribution competitive with the one from the vector operator.

            "heading": "G. Comment on tertiary observables",
            "text": "In the following, we briefly comment on the results for the tertiary observables extracted from the comprehensive scan. We find that none of these observables, listed in Table XI in Appendix E 3, provides a signal within the reach of current and planned experiments. Thus, any observation of new physics in these allows to falsify this model. We relegate detailed ranges for these observables for each LQ mass to Table XII in Appendix E 3 and only make a few comments below. Note that in Table XI also the present experimental constraints and calculation method employed in the comprehensive scan are found, while Table XII also displays the prospective future reach for these observables. For processes involving electrons, we first observe that the effective coupling of Z bosons to electrons is suppressed by small LQ couplings of O\u00f0\u03bb9\u00de; see Eqs. (53) and (56). Thus, we do not expect large LQ contributions to Z \u2192 ee in this model, as reflected in the data in Table XII. We see that these contributions are up to eleven orders of magnitude below future sensitivities. Similarly, the contribution to the AMM of the electron generated in this model for each LQ mass is O\u00f010\u221221\u00de. Present measurements of \u0394ae hint at a preference for j\u0394aej \u223c 10\u221212 [163,164], although these two measurements indicate deviations from the SM value with opposite sign and comparable magnitude. We, therefore, note that this model would be incapable of addressing this anomaly but could be revisited in case the present discrepancy in the experimental results is resolved. Likewise, the results for the EDM of the\nelectron show that a detection in future experiments [165] should not be expected. We predict the BRs for Bs \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4, Ds \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd, and Ds \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd to be only slightly beyond the projected sensitivities to these observables. Furthermore, the future sensitivities for tau decays to a muon and light mesons, i.e., BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u00bd\u03c1;\u03d5; \u03c0 \u03bc\u00de, are only one or two orders of magnitude above the maximum value generated for these observables in the comprehensive scan. These decays can thus be of interest when considering a next generation of experiments, beyond what is currently found in the literature. Lastly, we comment on the results for Bs \u2212 B\u0304s mixing; see \u0394MBs=\u0394M SM Bs\nin Tables XI and XII. Comparing the obtained values in Table XII with the current experimental constraint, quoted in Table XI, we note that for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 6, there are points which generate \u0394MBs=\u0394M SM Bs\noutside the allowed 3\u03c3 region. However, the data, presented in Table XII, do not necessarily satisfactorily address the flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and in the AMM of the muon. Indeed, once a value of \u0394a\u03bc is achieved within the experimentally preferred 3\u03c3 range, the obtained interval for \u0394MBs=\u0394M SM Bs\nis significantly reduced for all considered LQ masses, such that it always agrees with the current experimental constraint at the 2\u03c3 level or better. As there is no projection for future reach available for \u0394MBs=\u0394M SM Bs\n, we have classified it as tertiary rather than secondary observable."

            "heading": "VII. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK",
            "text": "We have considered an extension of the SM with two Higgs doublets Hu and Hd (in the decoupling limit) and one scalar LQ \u03d5 that transforms as \u00f03; 1;\u2212 1\n3 \u00de under the SM\ngauge group. The main purpose of the LQ \u03d5 is to explain the flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and in the AMM of the muon. The flavor structure of this model is constrained by the flavor group Gf \u00bc D17 \u00d7 Z17. The three scalars Hu, Hd, and \u03d5 are singlets under the dihedral group, whereas the three generations of all SM fermion species transform as doublet and singlet, apart from the three RH up-type quarks that are all singlets. In this way, the masses of the charged fermions of the third generation arise without breaking the dihedral group. The flavor symmetryGf is (mainly) broken by the VEVs of four different spurions, called S, T, U, and W, that are assigned to doublets of the dihedral group. While the role of S is to (mainly) generate the LQ couplings x\u0302 and y\u0302, T andU are responsible for the mass of the second and first generation of both down-type quarks and charged leptons, respectively. The spurion W, eventually, is necessary in order to give mass to the charm quark and to generate the correct size of the Cabibbo angle. The smaller quark mixing angles as well as the up quark mass arise automatically due to the spurions S as well as T and U, respectively.\n075014-53\nAccording to their roles, the VEVs of these spurions are of different order of magnitude in the expansion parameter \u03bb, \u03bb \u2248 0.2, i.e., hSi\u223c\u03bb, hTi\u223c\u03bb2, hUi\u223c\u03bb4, and hWi \u223c \u00f0\u03bb5; \u03bb4\u00det. In order to achieve suitable textures for the LQ couplings x\u0302 and y\u0302 and, at the same time, avoid too large effects related to quarks and/or leptons of the first generation, a residual symmetry Zdiag17 , being the diagonal subgroup of a Z17 group, contained in D17, and the external Z17 symmetry, is preserved by both x\u0302 and y\u0302 at LO. We have performed analytical and numerical studies of the phenomenology of this model. In doing so, all considered observables have been classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary. The primary observables include the flavor anomalies in R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and in the AMM of the muon as well as observables for which the present experimental measurements can (significantly) constrain the viable parameter space of this model. Secondary observables instead do not currently provide competitive constraints, but midterm future experiments offer an opportunity to probe them and, thus, this model. For the primary as well as secondary observables analytical estimates are given. Lastly, tertiary observables are not expected to allow us to probe the model in the midterm future but are discussed lest future measurements bring these into disagreement with the SM. In the primary scan, we have focused on the primary observables and varied the effective parameters of the LQ couplings in the charged fermion mass basis as (mostly) independent complex order-one numbers. In this way, we have identified the two radiative cLFV decays \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 as the most stringent constraints on the parameter space of the model. Furthermore, we have extracted biases on the effective parameters of the LQ couplings which have been used to guide the more thorough comprehensive scan. A simultaneous reconciliation of all three flavor anomalies has proven to be very challenging in the primary scan. The comprehensive scan has involved primary, secondary, and tertiary observables. In contrast to the primary scan, it has been performed over effective parameters in the interaction basis. Thus, a subset of these has been fixed by a chi-squared fit to the charged fermion masses and quark mixing, achieving excellent agreement with the measured values (for scenario B). The remaining parameters, taken to be complex order-one numbers and parametrizing the LQ couplings, have been biased using the input from the primary scan. In the comprehensive scan, we have found that this model is compatible with all constraints, while being capable of explaining the observed deviations in R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and \u0394a\u03bc from the SM predictions within the 3\u03c3 ranges of their present best-fit values for LQ masses of 2 and 4 TeV. Furthermore, a LQ with a mass of 2 TeVallows for compatibility with all considered constraints, while reconciling the three flavor anomalies at the 2\u03c3 level. The secondary observables studied in the comprehensive scan are the EDM of the muon, the effective coupling\nof Z bosons to muons, the LFU ratios R\u03bc=eD and R e=\u03bc D\u22c6 as well as BR\u00f0B \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd\u00de. The differences between the parameter space probed by the primary and the comprehensive scan have been discussed in detail. The use of the interaction basis is the main reason for the comprehensive scan being able to reconcile all three flavor anomalies. At the same time, this has shown a considerable preference for one of the effective parameters, namely b13, being slightly smaller than expected from the construction of the model. This indicates that an improved version of this model should further suppress this particular LQ coupling by \u03bb or \u03bb2. Contributions beyond the ones from \u03b3-penguins can play an important role in several decays such that, e.g., not only the tau decay \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3 can be accessible at Belle II, but, at the same time, \u03c4 \u2192 3\u03bc and \u03c4 \u2192 \u03bcee\u0304 can be measured. For the primary observables with neutrinos in the final state, i.e., R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, R\u03bdK\u22c6 and the lifetime of the Bc meson, LFV contributions are found to be relevant, generating effects up to 40% in some instances. There are several interesting directions to expand the current study. On the phenomenological side, it is highly interesting to study the observables R\u00f0J=\u03c8\u00de and R\u00f0\u039bc\u00de that are (tightly) related to the analyzed b \u2212 c transitions as well as the angular distributions of B \u2192 D\u22c6ei\u03bd [166] and the longitudinal polarization of the tau lepton in B \u2192 D\u22c6\u03c4\u03bd [134]. Some of these also reveal a (slight) disagreement between the current measured value and the SM expectation, e.g., R\u00f0J=\u03c8\u00de [167]. Other flavor anomalies, such as those observed in b \u2212 s transitions, e.g., in R\u00f0K\u00de, R\u00f0K\u22c6\u00de and in the process Bs \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc, may also be relevant to address, see, e.g., Ref. [168] for a recent concise overview. For this purpose, an additional LQ, for example transforming as \u00f03; 3;\u2212 1\n3 \u00de under the SM gauge group, has to be\nadded to the model, see, e.g., Refs. [71,75,80,169]. This may have the added effect of simultaneously generating neutrino masses. A neutrino mass mechanism could be incorporated in many different ways. It could be either one type of seesaw mechanism, e.g., by adding RH neutrinos to the existing model [170], or some radiative generation mechanism, see Ref. [171] for a review. In the current analysis, it has been assumed, for simplicity, that possible diquark couplings of the LQ \u03d5 are forbidden by a baryon number symmetry. However, it may also be interesting to study the efficacy of Gf to suppress these couplings beyond the strong existing bounds from searches for proton decay [98], see, e.g., Refs. [88,172] for studies about also controlling them with the help of a flavor symmetry. With nonvanishing neutrino masses, lepton mixing becomes physical and its appropriate description, i.e., two large mixing angles and one small one [173], may require a change in the assignment of the LH lepton doublets to representations of Gf or even the extension or change of Gf itself. The observed lepton mixing angles\n075014-54\nare often interpreted as sign of unification of the three generations of LH lepton doublets into a three-dimensional irreducible representation of the flavor symmetry; for reviews, see Refs. [6\u20139]. Prime candidates for such a flavor symmetry are the groups belonging to the series \u0394\u00f06n2\u00de with n integer and at least two [174]. As has been shown, they lead to an adequate description of lepton as well as quark mixing; see, e.g., Refs. [175\u2013179], and also of the charged fermion mass hierarchies, if accompanied by an appropriate external symmetry, see e.g. the supersymmetric model in Ref. [180]. Furthermore, it is interesting to consider adding a CP symmetry to Gf, given that this can also constrain the two Majorana phases in the lepton sector [181] (see also Refs. [3,182\u2013188]). This might, at the same time, be beneficial for controlling the amount of CP violation in the LQ couplings. Eventually, an extension of the SM gauge group similar to the Pati-Salam theory has proven to be useful, since in this way the vector LQ transforming as \u00f03; 1; 2\n3 \u00de under the\nSM gauge group arises automatically, when breaking to the SM; see, e.g., Refs. [189\u2013193]. This vector LQ is capable of addressing all aforementioned flavor anomalies, assuming an appropriate structure of its couplings to the SM fermions can be achieved. While in the case of a vector LQ the flavor structure is determined by the gauge group of the model, for scalar LQs, explaining (some of) the observed flavor anomalies, it is also worth considering a possible embedding of the model into a (partially) unified theory endowed with a flavor (and CP) symmetry."

H. would like to thank the Instituto de Fisica Teorica (IFT UAM-CSIC) in Madrid for support via the Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa Program under Grant No. CEX2020-001007-S, during the Extended Workshop \u201cNeutrino Theories\u201d, where this work developed.\nNote added.\u2014After the completion of this work, the LHCb Collaboration has published a combined analysis of R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de [196] using muonic tau reconstruction, resulting in R\u00f0D\u00de \u00bc 0.441 0.060 0.066 and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de \u00bc 0.281 0.018 0.024, as well as an updated measurement [197] utilizing hadronic \u03c4\u00fe decays, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de \u00bc 0.257 0.012 0.018. These results are consistent with the SM predictions in Table I, for R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de within the 1\u03c3 and for R\u00f0D\u00de within the 2\u03c3 range, but with relatively large experimental uncertainties. Consequently, the HFLAV averages for R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de have been updated to include the new measurements [198], giving R\u00f0D\u00de \u00bc 0.356 0.029 and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de \u00bc 0.284 0.013 (with a correlation of \u03c1 \u00bc \u22120.37). Compared with the previous averages, quoted in Table I, this is closer to the SM prediction for R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, but further away from the SM value of R\u00f0D\u00de. Nevertheless, both averages remain in agreement at the 1\u03c3 level with the previous ones. The discrepancy with the SM predictions now amounts to 3.2\u03c3, which is only slightly reduced from 3.4\u03c3, see Table I. Thus, the results have not changed significantly and remain qualitatively the same. In any case, it is interesting to confront the outcome of the comprehensive scan with these new averages. In order to do so, we employ the same dataset as shown in Sec. VI and present Fig. 24 as updated version of Fig. 15. Once the primary constraints, see Table IV, are enforced in the comprehensive scan, we find 75(5)[0] points for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2\u00f04\u00de\u00bd6 that can now generate R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and the AMM of the muon within the respective 3\u03c3 ranges. In fact, this is a slight quantitative improvement over the 58(1)[0] points identified and discussed in Sec. VI D.\n075014-55\nAPPENDIX A: GROUP THEORY OF D17\nIn this appendix,we briefly summarize themain features of the non-Abelian discrete groupD17 [83]. It is amember of the series of dihedral groups Dn that are non-Abelian for n \u2265 3. It has 34 distinct elements and contains ten real irreducible representations: two singlets, the trivial singlet 11 as well as 12, and eight doublets, called 2i with i \u00bc 1;\u2026; 8. All these eight doublets are faithful. The group D17 can be described, like the other dihedral groups, with the help of two generators a and b which fulfil the following relations:\na17 \u00bc e; b2 \u00bc e; aba \u00bc b; \u00f0A1\u00de\nwith e denoting the neutral element of the group. The representation matrices a\u00f0r\u00de and b\u00f0r\u00de of the two generators a and b read in the different representations r,\na\u00f011\u00de \u00bc b\u00f011\u00de \u00bc 1 and a\u00f012\u00de \u00bc 1; b\u00f012\u00de \u00bc \u22121; \u00f0A2\u00de\nas well as\n075014-56\na\u00f02i\u00de\u00bc \u03c9i17 0\n0 \u03c917\u2212i17\nand b\u00f02i\u00de\u00bc\n0 1\n1 0\n; \u00f0A3\u00de\nwhere \u03c917 is the 17th root of unity, \u03c917 \u00bc e2\u03c0i17 . In this model, we onlymake use of the doublets 21, 22, 23, and 24. The most relevant Kronecker products and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are presented in the following. The latter have a particularly simple form in the chosen basis. Assume a and b are singlets, \u00f0c1c2\u00de, \u00f0 d1 d2 \u00de are doublets, then we have [83]\n11 \u00d7 11\u2236ab \u223c 11; \u00f0A4a\u00de\n11 \u00d7 12\u2236ab \u223c 12; \u00f0A4b\u00de\n12 \u00d7 12\u2236ab \u223c 11; \u00f0A4c\u00de\n11 \u00d7 2i\u2236 ac1 ac2 \u223c 2i; \u00f0A4d\u00de\n12 \u00d7 2i\u2236 ac1 \u2212ac2 \u223c 2i; \u00f0A4e\u00de\n21 \u00d7 21\u2236c1d2 \u00fe c2d1 \u223c 11; c1d1 c2d2 \u223c 22;\nc1d2 \u2212 c2d1 \u223c 12; \u00f0A4f\u00de\n21 \u00d7 22\u2236 c2d1 c1d2 \u223c 21;\nc1d1 c2d2 \u223c 23; \u00f0A4g\u00de\n22 \u00d7 22\u2236c1d2 \u00fe c2d1 \u223c 11; c1d1 c2d2 \u223c 24;\nc1d2 \u2212 c2d1 \u223c 12; \u00f0A4h\u00de\n21 \u00d7 23\u2236 c2d1 c1d2 \u223c 22;\nc1d1 c2d2 \u223c 24; \u00f0A4i\u00de\n22 \u00d7 23\u2236 c2d1 c1d2 \u223c 21;\nc1d1 c2d2 \u223c 25; \u00f0A4j\u00de\n23 \u00d7 23\u2236c1d2 \u00fe c2d1 \u223c 11; c1d1 c2d2 \u223c 26;\nc1d2 \u2212 c2d1 \u223c 12; \u00f0A4k\u00de\n21 \u00d7 24\u2236 c2d1 c1d2 \u223c 23;\nc1d1 c2d2 \u223c 25; \u00f0A4l\u00de\n22 \u00d7 24\u2236 c2d1 c1d2 \u223c 22;\nc1d1 c2d2 \u223c 26; \u00f0A4m\u00de\n23 \u00d7 24\u2236 c2d1 c1d2 \u223c 21;\nc1d1 c2d2 \u223c 27; \u00f0A4n\u00de\n24 \u00d7 24\u2236c1d2 \u00fe c2d1 \u223c 11; c1d1 c2d2 \u223c 28; c1d2 \u2212 c2d1 \u223c 12: \u00f0A4o\u00de We note, furthermore, that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combinations, involving conjugated fields, look slightly different, since the generator a is chosen as complex matrix in the two-dimensional representations 2i, although all these representations are real.

It constitutes the dominant contribution to the observablesR\u00f0D\u00de,R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and \u03c4SMBc in this model. According to Eqs. (C30) and (C31) in Appendix C 3 b, we find CSRR\u03bdedu;3332\u2248\u22121.7x33y32=\u00f02m2\u03d5\u00de\u2248\u22121.7a33b32=\u00f02m2\u03d5\u00de at the hadronic scale, \u03bc \u00bc \u03bcB \u00bc 4.8 GeV. Note the following statements are directly inferred from the primary scan, which is discussed in Sec. V. A comparison with the comprehensive scan, see Sec. VI, only reveals small deviations from the results described below for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2. As can be seen in the top in Fig. 25, the achievable deviation of R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de from their respective SM values grows linearly with the magnitude of CSRR\u03bdedu;3332. Only for jCSRR\u03bdedu;3332j \u2273 0.2=TeV2, a slight deviation from this trend becomes visible. This confirms that the contributions to R\u00f0D\u00de and R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, which are linear in the Wilson coefficient, since they arise from the interference with the SM contribution, see Eqs. (66) and (67), dominate for smaller values of the LQ couplings. These plots also conveniently illustrate that the anomalies are mainly driven by the experimental data for R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, that is, explaining R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de at the 2\u03c3\u00f01\u03c3\u00de level requires jCSRR\u03bdedu;3332j\u2273 0.2\u00f00.3\u00de=TeV2. The center-left plot in Fig. 25 evidences that a correlation between the AMM of the muon, \u0394a\u03bc \u221d jb23c23j, and the Wilson coefficient, jCSRR\u03bdedu;3332j \u221d ja33b32j, only arises after\n075014-66\n075014-67\nimposing the bound on BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de, BR\u00f0\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03b3\u00de \u221d jb23c33j2 \u2248 jb23a33j2. Indeed, the current constraint requires that jCSRR\u03bdedu;3332j\u2272 0.4=TeV2 [114], and the upcoming search for this process at Belle II [115] can strengthen this to jCSRR\u03bdedu;3332j\u2272 0.15=TeV2, see center-right plot. Note that an efficient test of the capability of the model to explain the AMM of the muon still requires a further refinement of that bound, as is visible in the center-left plot. Lastly, one can see that the inferred value of \u03c4SMBc is slightly less sensitive to jCSRR\u03bdedu;3332j than R\u00f0D\u00de or R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de are. The distribution of generated sample points for m\u0302\u03d5 \u00bc 2 features a kink, which is localized at the upper boundary of the colored region at jCSRR\u03bdedu;3332j \u2248 0.13=TeV2, due to the experimental constraint on b32, jb32j < 2.6; see Table IV. Note that jCSRR\u03bdedu;3332j\u2273 0.3=TeV2 is necessary to have BR\u00f0Bc \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd) exceed approximately 0.1."

            "heading": "1. Details of implementation of comprehensive scan",
            "text": "In the following, we present details of how the comprehensive scan has been implemented. First note that, although the LQ couplings are sampled in the interaction basis, they are input to SPheno in the charged fermion mass basis, which avoids modifying the hard-coded fermion masses in SPheno. As such, we use the unitary matrices Ld,\nRd, Le, Re, Lu, and Ru, extracted from the chi-squared fit discussed in Sec. VI A, to perform this basis transformation. As mentioned in Sec. VA 2, the correction to the muon mass arising from LQ contributions could be corrected for by appropriately redefining the effective parameter e22 in the charged lepton mass matrix Me; see Eqs. (42) and (43). Nevertheless, since this redefinition has hardly any effect on the form of the unitary matrices Le and Re, see analytic expressions in Eqs. (44) and (45), it is neglected throughout the scan. Furthermore, we notice that we implement the model in the comprehensive scan in a simplified version, considering only one SM-like Higgs doublet that gives masses to all charged fermions. As explained in Sec. II, the main reason for having two Higgs doublets,Hu andHd, is to facilitate the search for a suitable flavor symmetry. The existence of these two Higgs doublets is, however, not relevant for the explanation of the flavor anomalies, observed in R\u00f0D\u00de, R\u00f0D\u22c6\u00de, and in the AMMof the muon. As a consequence, the suppression of the down-type quark masses and of the charged lepton masses is no longer due to the VEV of Hd being much smaller than that of Hu, compare Eq. (13), but becomes encoded in the effective parameters dij and eij, that must be appropriately rescaled. Such a rescaling only changes the magnitudes of these parameters, but not the results for the unitary matrices Ld, Rd, Le, Re, Lu, and Ru, since the latter contain ratios of dij, eij, and fij, respectively. Therefore, this simplification has no impact on the calculated\nLQ couplings x, y, and z. In addition, considering only one SM-like Higgs doublet allows us to simplify the implementation of this model with the computational tools employed. We proceed as follows with sampling over the parameter space consistently with the biasing, discussed in Sec. VI B: (1) Sample a\u030233, b\u030232, and b\u030223 using the biases for the\neffective parameters in the charged fermion mass basis; see Table VI and Eq. (101). Sample all other effective parameters in the interaction basis, including a\u030223 and b\u030213, with flat priors within the ranges specified in Eqs. (60) and (61). (2) Transform these parameters into the ones in the charged fermion mass basis using the unitary\nmatrices Ld, Rd, Le, Re, Lu, and Ru, extracted from the chi-squared fit discussed in Sec. VI A. (3) Check that the generated values of the effective parameters a23 and b13 satisfy Eq. (100), and that a23 and the cosine of the arguments of the latter and the effective parameter b23 are within the prescribed regions in Table VI. (4) If any of the checks in step 3 fails, return to step 1; otherwise, a valid set of effective parameters is found. The distribution of the magnitudes of the effective parameters in the charged fermion mass basis, output from the comprehensive scan, is summarized in Table X.\n075014-69"
