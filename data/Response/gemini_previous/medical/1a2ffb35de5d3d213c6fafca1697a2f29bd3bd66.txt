1. **Investigate the effects of combining different methods for improving meat protein digestibility.** For example, could a combination of ultrasound and HPP treatments further improve protein digestion compared to either method alone?


2. **Explore the use of plant-derived proteases in combination with physical methods to improve meat protein digestibility.** This could potentially lead to a synergistic effect, with the plant-derived proteases breaking down the protein structure and the physical methods further disrupting the muscle fibers and connective tissues.


3. **Investigate the impact of different cooking methods on the digestibility of meat proteins.** For example, does sous vide cooking at different temperatures and times affect protein digestibility differently than traditional cooking methods such as grilling or roasting?


4. **Examine the effects of different types of meat on protein digestibility.** Do different types of meat, such as beef, pork, chicken, or fish, respond differently to the various methods for improving protein digestibility?


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the effects of consuming meat proteins that have been treated to improve digestibility on older adults.** This would provide direct evidence of the benefits of these methods for improving protein utilization and overall health in this population.
