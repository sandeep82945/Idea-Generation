About 20 per cent of BCGs are cD-type galaxies, i.e. upergiant ellipticals (Seigar, Graham & Jerjen 2007 ; Coziol et al. 009 ). cD galaxies have diffuse envelopes of old stellar population hat are \u223c10 times larger than that of a typical elliptical. cD BCGs re theorized to have grown via minor mergers and tidal stripping vents linked to cluster formation (Dubinski 1998 ; Coziol et al. 2009 ; e Propris et al. 2021 ). Although the gas reservoirs of cD galaxies re generally depleted, cold gas reserv oirs ha v e been observ ed in everal cD BCGs at the centre of cool-core clusters (Hogan 2014 ; organti & Oosterloo 2018 , and references therein). Cool-core clusters exhibit strongly peaked X-ray profiles and short entral cooling times ( t cool < 7 Gyr, Mittal et al. 2009 ). Their central cooling flow\u2019 is thought to be responsible for the presence of cold as in their BCGs (e.g. Hogan 2014 ). Here, we present the case of cool-core cluster cD BCG hosting cold gas of origin that cannot imply be attributed to the presence of a cooling flow.\nThe Norma cluster (ACO 3627) is a nearby ( z = 0.016, d \u2248 0 Mpc) and massive ( M \u223c 10 15 h \u22121 73 M ) X-ray bright (2 \u00d7 10 \u221210 rgs s \u22121 cm \u22122 ) galaxy cluster (Boehringer et al. 1996 ; Woudt et al. 008 ). Norma is considered a younger analogue of the Coma cluster. oma is a more virialized and distant but a similarly massive and Xay bright cluster compared to Norma (Kraan-Korteweg et al. 1996 ; oudt et al. 1998 ; Bra v o-Alf aro et al. 2000 ). The Norma cluster, lik e he Coma cluster, hosts two bright cD galaxies. The two brightest\nE-mail: manasvee.saraf@research.uwa.edu.au\nT v k\nPub\nalaxies in the Norma cluster are ESO 137-G006 and ESO 137-G008, ith the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) K -band luminosity f L Ks = 10 11 . 76 L (Sun et al. 2007 , 2009 ). ESO 137-G006 and SO 137-G008 are offset by 5.5 arcmin ( \u223c109 kpc) and 10.5 arcmin \u223c208 kpc), respectively, from the cluster core, defined by the peak -ray emission (Boehringer et al. 1996 ; Sun et al. 2007 ). Following un et al. ( 2009 ), we identify ESO 137-G006 to be the main BCG f the Norma cluster as it is located closer to the peak of the X-ray mission and has the brightest 1.4-GHz luminosity in the cluster L 1 . 4 GHz = 10 25 . 38 W Hz \u22121 , Sun et al. 2007 ).\nA sub-cluster, that is likely to be merging into the main cluster, as been observed in the X-ray distribution of Norma (Boehringer t al. 1996 ). In combination with the observed spatial offset between he cD galaxies and the cluster core, this ongoing sub-cluster merger s consistent with Norma being a dynamically young cluster (Coziol t al. 2009 ; Hamer et al. 2012 ; Hashimoto, Henry & Boehringer 014 ; De Propris et al. 2021 ). ESO 137-G006 (WKK 6269) is the focus of this study and has an\n-ray cool-core of the luminous corona type associated with its active alactic nucleus (AGN, Sun et al. 2007 , 2009 ; Nishino, Fukazawa & ayashi 2012 ). This BCG is one of two radio galaxies near Norma\u2019s ore and has strong radio lobes ( L 1 . 4 GHz = 10 25 . 38 W Hz \u22121 , Sun et al. 007 ) bent in a \u2018C\u2019 shaped wide-angle tail (WAT) morphology Jones & McAdam 1996 ). The presence of cold gas is understood to e key in the formation of such strong radio lobes (e.g. Bicknell 1995 ; organti, Tadhunter & Oosterloo 2005 ; Emonts et al. 2008 ). The AT is spatially aligned (in projection) with the X-ray sub-cluster, lacing this BCG at the leading edge of the sub-cluster merger. he observed line-of-sight velocity offset between the mean cluster elocity (4871 \u00b1 54 km s \u22121 ) and that of ESO 137-G006 (5441 \u00b1 52 m s \u22121 ) provides further support to the sub-cluster merger hypothesis\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s) lished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\n( f G\nT ( t a i e i d W 2 2 M o 2\no E s s o fi b f\no s p s a t d t i o u d S\nc H\n2\n2\nW p m c t k w O f r\no f\n1 T A t (\nc h p i F\n2\nT T c s\nf r a r U n t s R w u N M D 7\nd a s t f v 2 c r f S\ni o i 1 T a 1 9 e a f p a w t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/519/3/4128/6939833 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nWoudt et al. 2008 ). Despite being a massive cluster currently in ormation, Norma is not well studied due to its location behind the alactic plane (Jones & McAdam 1996 ; Woudt et al. 1998 ). Radio emission is not attenuated by the Galaxy in the foreground. he 21-cm line traces the spin-flip transition of atomic hydrogen H I ). Thus, observations at radio wavelengths can enable us to probe he H I content of ESO 137-G006. With the current technological dvancements, dense H I columns ( N H I \u2265 10 19 cm \u22122 ) are detected n absorption against radio-loud AGN ( L 1 . 4 GHz \u2265 10 24 W Hz \u22121 , Sun t al. 2009 ; Allison et al. 2022 ). The absorption profiles allow the nvestigation of cold gas properties such as the H I distribution, ynamics, and kinematics (e.g. Morganti et al. 2001 , 2006 ; Curran & hiting 2010 ; Oosterloo et al. 2010 ; Chandola, Gupta & Saikia 013 ; Allison et al. 2015 , 2016 ; Moss et al. 2017 ; Grasha et al. 019 ; Deb et al. 2020 ; Kerrison et al. 2021 ; Mahony et al. 2022 ). oreo v er, radio interferometers are able to spatially resolve the core f ESO 137-G006 due to Norma\u2019s proximity (e.g. Ramatsoku et al. 020 ). In this study, we use Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) bservations to conduct a search for H I towards the core region of SO 137-G006 with higher sensitivity and resolution than previous tudies (e.g. Allison, Sadler & Meekin 2014 ). Our observation uggests that cold gas is associated (within 5 kpc) with this BCG f a very massive but dynamically young cool-core cluster. Thus, we nd that some BCGs may retain or attain cold gas in the process of eing accreted into the cluster\u2019s core during the later stages of cluster ormation.\nThis paper describes our search of H I absorption towards the core f Norma\u2019s BCG, ESO 137-G006. Section 2 describes the ATCA obervations of high spectral resolution and our adopted data-reduction rocess to optimize these observations for high spatial resolution and ensitivity. Section 3 presents the resulting H I absorption detection ssociated with ESO 137-G006 and the analysis, we conducted on he location, kinematics, density and temperature of the H I . Section 4 iscusses the cold gas and stellar properties of ESO 137-G006 and he implications of this H I detection on our understanding of cold gas n massive ( M \u223c 10 15 M ) cool-core cluster BCGs. The limitations f our work and the possible advancements that can be made with pcoming radio surv e ys and new high-resolution multiwavelength ata are also discussed in Section 4 . We summarize our findings in ection 5 . Throughout this paper, we assume a Lambda cold dark matter osmology with M = 0.3 and = 0.7, and a Hubble constant of 0 = 70 km s \u22121 Mpc \u22121 .\nOBSERVATIONS A N D DATA R E D U C T I O N\n.1 ATCA obser v ations\ne acquire the ATCA observations of Norma\u2019s central \u22481 deg 2 from roject C2891, conducted in October 2013. We use the observations ade with the 6A array configuration centred at 1396 MHz. The onfiguration of the Compact Array Broadband Backend (CABB) is he 64-MHz zoom mode (with 64-MHz bandwidth across 2049 32- Hz channels, Wilson et al. 2011 ). From this CABB configuration, e obtain a spectral resolution of 6.6 km s \u22121 in radio velocity. bservations from the 6A array configuration, with baselines ranging rom 337m to 5939m, can be optimized for the high spatial resolution equired to resolve the core of ESO 137-G006.\nThe observations were taken in mosaicking mode, which consisted f 26 pointings. These pointings were observed for \u22482 min each, ollowed by an \u22484.3 min scan of the nearby phase calibrator, PKS\n613-586, to enable time-varying bandpass and gain corrections. his cycle was repeated 10\u201312 times for impro v ed uv -co v erage. The TCA primary calibrator, PKS 1934-638, was observed for \u22487 min o enable the calibration of the absolute flux scale and the bandpass see Appendix A for more details).\nWe integrate over \u224811 h of observations to achieve optimal uv - o v erage. Since these observations were conducted at night, they ave minimal effects of solar interference. We only reduce data from ointings 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, and 23 because ESO 137-G006 s located in the intersecting region between these pointings (see ig. 1 a).\n.2 Data reduction\nhe observations are processed using the MIRIAD software (Sault, euben & Wright 1995 ). We follow the standard procedures for ontinuum and spectral-line data reduction to optimize for high patial resolution and sensitivity.\nWe flag, calibrate and continuum-subtract the uv -data in the ollowing manner. Using ATLOD , we load the uv -data at the H I est frequency (1.420 4058 GHz) and flag channels at the edge nd with known radio-frequency interference (RFI). We flag the emaining RFI emission using UVFLAG , BLFLAG , and PGFLAG . sing UVFLUX , we compare the theoretical root mean square (RMS) oise of the observations with the RMS noise of the flagged uv -data o ensure that the sensitivity of our flagged data set has not been ignificantly diminished by the flagging process. We confirm that the MS noise of the flagged uv -data for all our pointings is comparable ith their respective theoretical RMS noise and that there are no nexpected peaks in the mean amplitude of each pointing\u2019s uv -data. ext, we calibrate the uv -data with the primary calibrator, using FCAL , and with the phase calibrator, using GPCAL and GPCOPY . ue to remaining RFI, we flag all data within the velocity range, 668 < v < 9056 km s \u22121 , using UVFLAG . We separate each of the pointing\u2019s continuum and line uv - ata individually using UVLIN . UVLIN models the continuum in ll the line-free channels as a polynomial to perform continuum ubtraction or extraction. We fit a low-order polynomial to represent he continuum spectrum for each pointing\u2019s uv -data (see appendix B or more details). We conduct the continuum subtraction in the isibility plane as done in similar previous studies (e.g. Reeves et al. 016 ; Maccagni et al. 2018 ). Ho we ver, due to the strong and extended ontinuum emission within the target field, there remains a residual ipple in the baseline of the line spectrum after imaging. We account or this ripple by conducting baseline subtraction, as explained in ection 3 . We image the continuum and line uv -data separately in the followng manner. Using INVERT , we perform inv erse F ourier transform n the pointings individually. We set INVERT to create \u2018dirty\u2019 cubes, n Stokes I polarization , with pixels of size 2 arcsec centred on ESO 37-G006 [RA (J2000) = 16:15:04 and Dec. (J2000) = \u221260:54:26]. o achieve an optimal balance between signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) nd resolution, we weight the baselines with robustness \u22120.5 (Briggs 995 ). As a result, the dirty cubes have a theoretical RMS noise, \u03c3 \u2248 mJy beam \u22121 , with a synthesized Gaussian beam (yellow hatched llipse in Fig. 1 c) of full width at half-maximum, FWHM = 9 \u00d7 7 rcsec 2 , and position angle, PA = 31 \u25e6 (measured counterclockwise rom North throughout this paper). To perform deconvolution, we roduce Clean component models (with cut-off = 5 \u03c3 ) using CLEAN nd restore the dirty cubes with these models using RESTOR . Finally, e use LINMOS to linearly mosaic the individual \u2018clean\u2019 cubes of he seven pointings. To optimize for dynamic range, we set LINMOS\nMNRAS 519, 4128\u20134141 (2023)\nMNRAS 519, 4128\u20134141 (2023)\nFigure 1.

We obtain two 64-MHz bandwidth clean osaic cubes \u2013 a continuum cube and an H I spectral cube with RMS oise of 155 and 34 mJy beam \u22121 , respectively. Additionally, we create a total intensity continuum image at 396 MHz (presented in Fig. 1 ). We use INVERT to perform multirequency synthesis imaging on the unsubtracted uv -data. We set a \u03c3 cutoff in CLEAN using the theoretical RMS noise of the dirty mage, 0.3 mJy beam \u22121 . The RMS noise in the resulting clean image s 6 mJy beam \u22121 .\nWe use the Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy CARTA, Comrie et al. 2021 ) to inspect the spectral cube and the otal intensity continuum image. The WAT morphology of the radio ontinuum core and lobes of ESO 137-G006 observed in our ATCA ata is consistent with that reported by Ramatsoku et al. ( 2020 ). In he spectral cube, we detect H I in absorption against the radio core.\ne detect no H I in emission. To constrain the extent of the H I absorption, we first constrain he spatial extent of the background continuum source. To find and t the continuum source, we use the IMFIT task of MIRIAD on he total intensity continuum image, within a square aperture of ength 22 arcsec centred on RA (J2000) = 16:15:04 and Dec. (J2000) \u221260:54:26. This square aperture maximizes the co v erage of the adio core, while excluding any structure from the WAT, and has an MS residual of 5 mJy beam \u22121 . IMFIT returns a 10 \u00d7 9 arcsec 2 aussian at PA = 57 \u25e6 centred on RA (J2000) = 16:15:03.7 and ec. (J2000) = \u221260:54:24.9. This Gaussian has a total integrated ontinuum flux, at 1396 MHz, of 65 \u00b1 18 mJy and is comparable o the size of the synthesized beam. Ho we v er, inte grating across just ne FWHM of the synthesized beam underestimates the integrated ux density of the H I absorption feature by 1.2 Jy km s \u22121 (i.e. by 4 \u03c3 , ee Section 3.2 ). Thus, we extract the spectrum by integrating across n elliptical aperture twice the FWHM of the synthesized beam (blue llipse in Fig. 1 c).\nWe extract spectra of total flux density as a function of optical elocity using CARTA . Spectra are extracted from an 18 \u00d7 14 rcsec 2 elliptical aperture at PA = 31 \u25e6 centred on RA (J2000) 16:15:03.7 and Dec. (J2000) = \u221260:54:24.9. We refer to this lliptical aperture as the H I detection region throughout this paper. e extract a line spectrum from the spectral cube and, to calculate he H I optical depth, a continuum spectrum from the continuum ube (see Section 3.3 ). To distinguish the edges of the H I profile, we erform Hanning smoothing (with kernel = 3) on both the extracted pectra. In Section 3 , we analyse and present the H I properties of the moothed line and continuum spectra. We present the spectra without moothing in appendix C for completeness and reproducibility. We nd no significant differences between the H I properties of the pectra with and without smoothing (see Table D1 ). We also extract he spectra from the aforementioned square aperture and perform he same analysis as in Section 3 , and find no significant differnces between the H I properties of the spectra from the elliptical perture and those from the square aperture (see Appendix D for etails).\nRESULTS A N D ANALYSI S\nn this section, we present the total intensity continuum image at 396 MHz of the ATCA observ ations to wards ESO 137-G006 and he detected H I absorption spectrum.

Fig. 1 (a) displays the entire area f the reduced data. The dashed-grey circles (of radius 9.5 arcmin) re centred on the seven ATCA pointings and mark their co v erage ith more than 0.5 primary beam response. The o v erlapping re gion etween these dashed circles is a square of length 22.5 arcmin centred n RA (J2000) = 16:15:04 and Dec. (J2000) = \u221260:54:26. Within his o v erlapping re gion, the RMS noise lev el in the spectral cube s 6 mJy beam \u22121 and in the continuum total intensity image is 8\nJy beam \u22121 . The discrete colour scale used in all three panels of ig. 1 corresponds to integer factors of the RMS noise level in the ontinuum image. Shades of red and grey map the positive and e gativ e intensities, respectively. The 17 \u00d717 arcmin 2 zoomed panel (Fig. 1 b) around ESO 137- 006, displays the radio continuum structure of the BCG. The ydne y Univ ersity Molonglo Sk y Surv e y\u2019s (SUMSS) 843-MHz data re o v erlaid as purple contours (at three and fiv e times the RMS oise level of 0.9 Jy beam \u22121 ) for comparison with our 1396-MHz bserv ations. The bro wn dashed circle (of radius 15.5 arcmin) in ig. 1 (b) marks the H I Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) synthesized eam. In our reduced ATCA data, we obtain a more than 100 times maller synthesized beam, marked as the yellow hatched ellipse in he 1 arcmin 2 zoomed panel (Fig. 1 c). Using this higher resolution ata, we spatially locate the H I source between the host BCG\u2019s AT, centred on the unresolved radio continuum source. This H I etection region is marked by the blue ellipse in Fig. 1 (c). The H I ource spatially lies within ESO 137-G006\u2019s diameter, defined by the MASS 20.0 K -mag arcsec \u22122 isophotal diameter of 55 \u00d7 41.8 arcsec 2 t PA \u221270 \u25e6 (magenta dashed ellipse in Fig. 1 c). We do not detect I in emission or absorption, across a minimum of two channels nd one beam, anywhere else in the spectral cube including against he radio lobes of ESO 137-G006. Given the spectral resolution and he noise level in the spectral cube, our upper limit on the integrated pectral line is 0.2 Jy km s \u22121 .\n.1.2 Compact radio source\nn the 1396-MHz ATCA continuum observations, we find an unesolved source of total integrated continuum flux, 65 \u00b1 18 mJy, t the coordinates of ESO 137-G006 (Fig. 1 c). This unresolved ontinuum source is consistent in location, size and flux density ith the 167 mJy point source detected by Ramatsoku et al. ( 2020 ) sing the 1398 MHz Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT) data of igher resolution (7.5 arcsec synthesized beam) and sensitivity (20.8 Jy beam \u22121 RMS noise). At the distance of ESO 137-G006, 1 arcsec s equi v alent to 0.33 kpc (see Ramatsoku et al. 2020 ). Thus, in our TCA observations of synthesized beam 9 \u00d7 7 arcsec, an unresolved ource has a size upper limit of < 3 kpc. According to the definition sed in O\u2019Dea & Saikia ( 2021 ), compact steep-spectrum sources ave typical sizes < 20 kpc and gigahertz peaked-spectrum (GPS) ources have typical sizes < 0.5 kpc. The size upper limit of < 3 kpc n the detected unresolved continuum source and the radio lobes\u2019 orphology on both sides of this source suggest that it may be a ompact symmetric object (CSO; O\u2019Dea & Saikia 2021 ). A greater raction of compact radio sources than extended radio sources are etected with H I absorption (Morganti et al. 2001 ; Gupta et al. 006 ; Chandola et al. 2013 ; Ger \u0301eb, Morganti & Oosterloo 2014 ; rasha et al. 2019 ; O\u2019Dea & Saikia 2021 ). Hence, our H I absorption\netection is likely to be against a compact continuum core coincident ith the centre of ESO 137-G006. We can get more information about the evolutionary stage of ESO 37-G006\u2019s continuum core from its radio spectral index, \u03b1, defined y\n\u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u03b1, (1) here S \u03bd is the flux density at frequency \u03bd. In addition to our ATCA bservation at 1.4 GHz, we find a previous ATCA observation at 8 GHz (Burke-Spolaor et al. 2009 ) with a total continuum flux ensity of 140 \u00b1 50 mJy towards the core of ESO 137-G006. Using he two flux density measurements at 1.4 and 18 GHz, we estimate he core\u2019s spectral index to be \u03b1 = 0.3 \u00b1 0.2. This spectral index, .e. \u03b1 > \u22120.5, is consistent with that found by Ramatsoku et al. 2020 ) and suggests that ESO 137-G006\u2019s continuum core is a flatpectrum source (e.g. fig. 8 in Sadler 2016 ). On the other hand, many ore GPS sources, than flat-spectrum sources, have been detected ith absorption in early-type galaxies (ETGs, e.g. Morganti et al. 001 ; Chandola et al. 2013 ; Ger \u0301eb et al. 2014 ; Glowacki et al. 2017 ; rasha et al. 2019 ). So, we think future continuum measurements of SO 137-G006\u2019s radio core at other frequencies (between the range .4\u201318 GHz) could reveal a peak in the spectrum, suggesting that he core is a GPS source (e.g. Gupta et al. 2006 ; Chandola et al. 013 ; Kerrison et al. 2021 ). Nevertheless, the spectral index of ESO 37-G006\u2019s core suggests that we may have detected H I absorption gainst a young compact radio source with restarting AGN activity.\n.2 Spectral analysis\nhe line spectrum is extracted from the H I detection region in the pectral cube and smoothed by a Hanning kernel of 3. This spectrum s subtracted by a second-order polynomial, fit within 3940 < v < 961 km s \u22121 , to remo v e the residual baseline ripple in the velocity ange around the H I absorption profile (see Fig. C1 for the full andwidth perspective and appendix C for details of the baseline ubtraction). The total bandwidth of the observation is \u22121610 < v 12381 km s \u22121 , but only a fraction of this total bandwidth around he peak of the H I profile is displayed in the panels of Fig. 2 . Zoom panel Fig. 2 (b) displays the velocity range, 5150 < v < 5751 m s \u22121 , and is used to fit the H I profile. The peak of the profile is bserved at v peak = 5451 \u00b1 7 km s \u22121 . We do not fit a functional form o the absorption line due to the narrow width of the profile relative o the spectral resolution of our observations. Instead, we define the rofile edges at v start = 5324 and v end = 5556 km s \u22121 (vertical cyan otted lines). The minimum width at 50 per cent of the peak profile ntensity is W 50 = 21 \u00b1 15 km s \u22121 (horizontal cyan solid doublerrow line) and the maximum width at 20 per cent of the peak profile ntensity is W 20 = 150 \u00b1 22 km s \u22121 (horizontal cyan dashed doublerrow line). The W 20 spans 23 channels whereas the W 50 spans only our channels revealing that the profile is steep and has a narrow and broad component. The average optical velocity resolution, within he profile edges, is v = 6.8 km s \u22121 . The velocity centroid of the rofile, v H I = 5444 \u00b1 7 km s \u22121 , is defined as the mid-velocity of 20 (vertical blue dash\u2013dotted line and error bar). The RMS noise, in all the line-free channels of the baseline ubtracted line spectrum (i.e. within 3940 < v < 6961 km s \u22121 ), is S = 3 mJy. We check the significance of the H I detection in Fig. 2 (a), hich displays the velocity range, 4345 < v < 6556 km s \u22121 . The orizontal grey-shaded region marks three times the spectral noise. he flux density of the channel at the peak of the absorption profile, peak = \u221228 \u00b1 3 mJy, is significant at an 8 \u03c3 level. The flux density ntegrated between the profile edges, S H I = \u22121.9 \u00b1 0.3 Jy km s \u22121 , s significant at a 6 \u03c3 level. The profile area, i.e. S H I , is shaded in blue\nMNRAS 519, 4128\u20134141 (2023)\nM\nFigure 2.

In panel (a), the velocities of the BCG (magenta dashed) and Norma (golden dotted) are marked as vertical lines with error-bars.

The uncertainties on the peak and integrated ux densities, velocity centroid and widths of the H I profile are alculated using equations from Koribalski et al. ( 2004 ). In Fig. 2 (a), we also study the kinematics of the H I relative to hat of ESO 137-G006 and the Norma cluster. v H I is coincident ith optical recessional velocity of the BCG, v BCG = 5441 \u00b1 52 m s \u22121 (vertical magenta dashed line and error bar; Woudt et al. 008 ). Ho we ver, both v H I and v BCG are redshifted compared o Norma\u2019s mean line-of-sight velocity, v cluster = 4871 \u00b1 54 m s \u22121 (vertical golden dotted line and error bar; Woudt et al. 2008 ), nd velocity dispersion, \u03c3v, Norma = 925 km s \u22121 (vertical golden haded region; Woudt et al. 2008 ). The H I absorption line reported in this paper is not found with the IPASS data, consistent with the findings of Allison et al. ( 2014 ). e verify that this is indeed the case, due largely to the effects of eam smearing (see appendix E for more details). The MeerKAT bservations of ESO 137-G006, although more spatially resolved, oo cannot be used to detect this absorption as the y hav e a poorer pectral resolution ( \u223c44 km s \u22121 ) than our ATCA data (Ramatsoku t al. 2020 ). .3 H I properties n this section, we investigate the density and temperature of the etected H I absorption. .3.1 Optical depth of H I absorption he optical depth, \u03c4 ( v), as a function of velocity, v in km s \u22121 , is alculated as\n( v) = \u2212 ln (\n1 + S( v) c f S c ( v)\n) , (2)\nhere S ( v) is the flux density from the absorption spectrum, S c ( v) is he flux density from the continuum spectrum, and c f is the co v ering actor of the background source. We assume c f = 1 throughout this aper. The optical depth of the detected H I and its uncertainty are resented in Fig. 3 as the solid black line and grey-shaded region v er a wide velocity range, 3940 < v < 6961 km s \u22121 . The peak\nNRAS 519, 4128\u20134141 (2023)\nbsorption fraction, at v peak , is ( S / S c ) peak = 0.82 \u00b1 0.40, whereas he total absorption fraction, within the profile edges, is ( S / S c ) total = .24 \u00b1 0.03. Hence, the peak optical depth of the profile is \u03c4 peak = .7 \u00b1 0.3 and the optical depth integrated between the profile edges s \u222b\n\u03c4H I = 74 \u00b1 8 km s \u22121 . The uncertainties of S and S c have been dded in quadrature to determine the uncertainty of \u03c4 .\nWe use the v elocity-inte grated optical depth to estimate the H I bsorption column density, in atoms cm \u22122 , using:\nN H I , abs cm \u22122 \u2248 1 . 823 \u00d7 10 18 \u00d7 T spin K\n\u222b \u03c4H I d v\nkm s \u22121 , (3)\nhere the spin temperature (in Kelvin) of the gas, T spin , is assumed s the single excitation temperature in the partition function and he constant results from ignoring n > 1 states and assuming the ayleigh\u2013Jeans limit ( h \u03bd kT ) and the known spontaneous emission oefficients for the H I 21-cm transition (see the section 2.1.1 of llison et al. 2022 for the complete deri v ation of equation 3 ). The ntegrated optical depth corresponds to an absorption column density f N H I , abs \u2248 (1 . 3 \u00b1 0 . 2) \u00d7 10 20 T spin cm \u22122 .\n.3.2 Constraining the spin temperature from emission on-detection\nhe 21-cm transition in the hyperfine splitting of the H I n = 1 tate has a very low transition probability (Borthakur et al. 2010 ; eeves et al. 2016 ). So, a substantially dense column ( N H I \u2265 10 19 m \u22122 ) is required to detect the H I spectral line in absorption. The olumn density is proportional to the spin temperature, T spin , which s the weighted harmonic mean of different thermal components of I . An estimate of T spin can be used to constrain the densities and ntensities of these different thermal components (Allison et al. 2022 , nd references therein). There are two stable phases of H I in pressure quilibrium: the diffuse warm neutral matter (WNM) and dense cold eutral matter (CNM). In the CNM regions, spin temperature can e approximated as the kinetic temperature, 100 \u2264T K \u2264 1000 K, ince collisions dominate the H I hyperfine level populations. On he other hand, in the WNM re gions, radiativ e e xcitation starts to ominate collisional excitation, increasing the spin temperature to 000 \u2264T K \u2264 8000 K. This rise in temperature may be due to the\nFigure 3.

Hence to etermine the physical phase of the H I , we attempt to constrain the pin temperature. The H I spin temperature can only be directly estimated from a etection in emission, not absorption (Allison 2021 ). Ho we ver, since e did not detect the 21-cm line in emission, we can only provide an pper limit on the spin temperature. This upper limit is estimated by eriving the H I column density from an emission non-detection. To etermine if the emission non-detection is meaningful, we calculate he upper limit on H I mass with it. The mass of H I is related to its ntegrated emission flux, S int in Jy km s \u22121 , and distance, d in Mpc, by M H I M = 2 . 36 \u00d7 10 5 S int Jy km s \u22121 \u00d7 ( d Mpc )2 . (4) he detection limit, in the line spectrum of the H I detection region, s 3 \u03c3 S \u2248 10 mJy. To estimate S int , we integrate this limit as a top-hat unction o v er an approximation of the emission linewidth ( \u02dc W ). d v km s \u22121 = \u02dc W \u2248 150 km s \u22121 is assumed in previous studies of the orma cluster (Vollmer et al. 2001 ; Schr \u0308oder, Kraan-Korteweg & enning 2009 ). This results in the upper limits S int \u2264 1.5 Jy m s \u22121 and M H I \u2264 1 . 7 \u00d7 10 9 M . This upper limit is in line with he expected H I mass content of ETGs in the local Universe . For xample, Serra et al. ( 2012 ) have shown that only 5 per cent of the TGs observed by the ATLAS 3D project have global H I masses reater than 1 . 7 \u00d7 10 9 M . Since the emission non-detection is meaningful, we estimate the I emission column density by integrating the brightness temperaure ( T B ) o v er \u02dc W as N H I , em cm \u22122 \u2248 1 . 823 \u00d7 10 18 \u222b T B K d v km s \u22121 . (5)\nhe abo v e equation is deriv ed assuming the background radiation s negligible and approximating T S \u222b \u03c4H I d v \u2248 \u222b T B d v (for details, ee Meyer et al. 2017 , section 15). The v elocity-inte grated T B is he integrated temperature an extended black body needs to have to roduce the observed integrated emission flux, S int , in the Rayleigh\u2013 eans limit (see Meyer et al. 2017 , section 14). Assuming a Gaussian eam of solid angle bm = ( \u03c0\u03b8 a \u03b8b )/(4 ln (2)), we obtain the following\nquation for the v elocity-inte grated T B : \u222b T B\nK\nd v\nkm s \u22121 \u2248 1 . 360 \u00d7\n( \u03bb\ncm\n)2 \u00d7 1\n\u03b8a \u03b8b \u00d7 S int mJy km s \u22121 , (6)\nhere \u03b8 a = 9 arcsec and \u03b8b = 7 arcsec are the FWHM of the ynthesized beam and \u03bb = 21.1cm for the H I line. Using the onstrained S int in equation 6 , we obtain the upper limits T B \u2264 .4 \u00d7 10 4 K and N H I , em \u2264 2.6 \u00d7 10 22 cm \u22122 . We then divide this mission column density estimate by the absorption column density stimate, i.e. N H I , abs \u2248 (1 . 3 \u00b1 0 . 2) \u00d7 10 20 T spin cm \u22122 , to get the spin emperature upper limit, T spin \u2264 194 K.\nT B , thus T spin , can also be constrained by working backwards rom the stellar mass of ESO 137-G006 estimated in Vaddi et al. 2016 ). Scaling-relations of H I gas fraction with stellar mass, of ther galaxies in the local universe (e.g. Catinella et al. 2018 ), can e used to estimate M H I , thus S int (instead of 3 \u03c3 S ). Ho we ver, the pper limit on T spin from the non-detection of emission in ESO 137- 006 provides a tighter constraint. Therefore, we confirm that T spin 194 K is consistent with the detected H I being in the cold neutral hase. In the next section, we discuss the implications of detecting ense cold H I g as ag ainst ESO 137-G006\u2019s core that is likely a young ompact source.\nDI SCUSSI ON\nn this section, we explore how the detected H I fits in with the volution of ESO 137-G006 and discuss the limitations of our study.\n.1 Association of the H I absorption with ESO 137-G006\nrom the spatial and spectral analysis, we find it likely that the H I etected in absorption against ESO 137-G006\u2019s core is associated ith this BCG. The H I detection region is not only spatially located ithin the BCG\u2019s 2MASS isophotal diameter but the H I profile\u2019s elocity centroid (5444 \u00b1 7 km s \u22121 ) is also spectrally coincident with he BCG\u2019s recessional velocity (5441 \u00b1 52 km s \u22121 , Woudt et al. 008 ). Moreo v er, giv en the width and the shape of its absorption rofile, the H I appears to be a part of settled gas within ESO 137- 006. Ger \u0301eb et al. ( 2015 , hereafter G15 ), studied the H I absorption rofiles of 32 radio-loud galaxies similar to ESO 137-G006 (i.e. 1 . 4 GHz > 50 mJy). G15 found, like our detection against ESO 137- 006, that 10 of the H I profiles were narrow ( W 50 < 100 km s \u22121 and\nMNRAS 519, 4128\u20134141 (2023)\nM\nW b a s o t w\nH l H t H f i\n4\nF V e f a ( 1 c d d 2\nb m g M t e s t e o l p r u s w i e t r\nt E a s\n4\nW ( 2 g\ni c s d l d l d d\nm c t 4 1 ( C e h H m c r m\nm c O f P 1 1 M = ( 2 ( C A ( P =\na w 1 H b c a t ( t e E a E e c l ( l\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/519/3/4128/6939833 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\n20 < 200 km s \u22121 ) and symmetric ( < 50 km s \u22121 difference etween the profile\u2019s velocity centroid and peak). Of these narrow nd symmetric profiles, the ones that were coincident with the ystemic velocity of their background radio galaxies were indicative f the H I being settled in large-scale discs. This is consistent with he detected H I absorption profiles in the ATLAS 3D sample of ETGs ith typical W 50 < 80 km s \u22121 (Serra et al. 2012 , G15 ). In brief, given its location, velocity, width and shape, the detected I absorption feature in this study is unlikely to be an outflow in our ine of sight and more likely to be settled gas within ESO 137-G006. o we ver, the kinematics of the H I profile are comple x relativ e to he velocity dispersion of the Norma cluster. So, the origin of the I within the BCG could either be lefto v er gas reservoirs from the ormation stages or newly acquired gas reservoirs from interactions n evolutionary stages.\n.2 Cold gas properties of ETGs\nrom previous studies, we know that ESO 137-G006 is an ETG (e.g. addi et al. 2016 ). Using sensitive and targeted observations, Serra t al. ( 2012 ) and Davis et al. ( 2019 ) detected, in emission, a significant raction of ETGs with dense cold gas reservoirs albeit in smaller mounts than those of similarly massive late-type counterparts Saintonge & Catinella 2022 ). We detect small amounts ( M H I \u2264 . 7 \u00d7 10 9 M ) of dense ( N H I \u2248 (1 . 3 \u00b1 0 . 2) \u00d7 10 20 T spin cm \u22122 ) and old ( T spin \u2264 194 K) H I gas, intrinsic to ESO 137-G006. This etection is consistent with the cold gas properties of other ETGs, etected in absorption (e.g. Morganti et al. 2006 ; Oosterloo et al. 010 ) and emission (e.g. Serra et al. 2012 ; Davis et al. 2019 ). Given this detection of intrinsic dense cold atomic gas, it may e possible that ESO 137-G006 also possesses detectable cold olecular gas. Davis et al. ( 2019 ) found molecular carbon-monoxide as reservoirs in 22.4 per cent of ETGs in the local universe from the ASSIVE and ATLAS 3D surv e ys. This was the case regardless of he galaxies\u2019 mass, size, position on the fundamental plane, and local nvironment. Moreo v er, Serra et al. ( 2012 ) observed that ETGs with mall H I discs were forming molecular gas at efficiencies comparable o spiral galaxies, despite having lower H I column densities. Serra t al. ( 2012 ) also found on-going star formation activity in 70 per cent f ETGs with central H I . Ho we ver, the measurement or upper imit of molecular content towards ESO 137-G006 has not been ublished to date. Vaddi et al. ( 2016 ) estimate a low star formation ate (SFR = 1 . 54 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M yr \u22121 ) in ESO 137-G006 from farltraviolet luminosities corrected for contribution from the evolved tellar populations. This low SFR in ESO 137-G006 is consistent ith the BCG\u2019s Wide-field Infrared Surv e y Explorer (WISE) midnfrared colour\u2013colour properties (e.g. Wright et al. 2010 ; Jarrett t al. 2017 ), which suggest that the BCG is passive. This means that he majority of the mid-infrared emission from the BCG is due to adiation from its older stellar population.\nIn summary, the mass, density, and temperature of the H I intrinsic o ESO 137-G006 are as expected from what is observed in other TGs. The high H I column density indicates that the BCG might lso possess some molecular gas, but not in amounts enough to feed ignificant star formation.\n.3 Intrinsic cold gas in BCGs\ne know that ESO 137-G006 is the Norma cluster\u2019s central BCG Boehringer et al. 1996 ; Sun et al. 2007 ; Woudt et al. 2008 ; Sun 009 ). So, the detected H I gives us more information regarding the as content in the centre of this very massive cluster. Nevertheless,\nNRAS 519, 4128\u20134141 (2023)\nt is difficult to check if the H I properties of ESO 137-G006 are onsistent with the gas properties of other BCGs as a comprehensive earch for H I in absorption towards BCGs has not been conducted to ate. A sufficiently bright background radio source, such as a radiooud AGN ( L 1 . 4 GHz \u2265 10 24 W Hz \u22121 , e.g. Sun 2009 ), is required to etect H I in absorption. But not all BCGs are radio-loud galaxies ike ESO 137-G006. This makes detecting the H I absorption line if ficult, e ven against BCGs that have the most massive or the most ense gas reservoirs. As introduced earlier, the Coma cluster is thought to be a ore distant ( z = 0.023) and virialized counterpart of the Norma luster (Kraan-Korteweg et al. 1996 ). Like Norma, Coma also hosts wo dominant cD type galaxies in its core. These galaxies, NGC 889 and NGC 4874, have fainter 1.4-GHz luminosities ( L 1 . 4 GHz = 0 21 . 08 and 10 23 . 35 W Hz \u22121 , respectively) than that of ESO 137-G006 L 1 . 4 GHz = 10 25 . 38 W Hz \u22121 , Sun et al. 2007 ). As a consequence, oma\u2019s cD galaxies do not have bright enough continuum sources to nable the detection of H I in absorption. Ho we ver, the cD galaxies ave also not been detected with H I in emission ( M H I < 10 7 . 43 M , ealy et al. 2021 ). Vollmer et al. ( 2001 ) pose that Coma\u2019s cD galaxies ay in fact be H I -deficient either as a result of e v aporation, caused by onduction from the surrounding hot intergalactic medium, or due to am-pressure stripping as they moved through the dense intracluster edium (ICM) in the early stages of cluster evolution. Despite the difficulties of making the detection in absorption, ultiple BCGs have been detected with H I attributed to the coolore of their host clusters or groups (Hogan 2014 ; Morganti & osterloo 2018 , and references therein). Some examples of these, rom closest to farthest, include: PKS 0316 + 413 (NGC 1275) in the erseus Cluster (ACO 426, z = 0.018; De Young, Roberts & Saslaw 973 ; Jaffe, de Bruyn & Sijbreng 1988 ; Sijbring et al. 1989 ; Jaffe 990 ; Momjian, Romney & Troland 2002 ; Chandola et al. 2013 ; oss et al. 2017 ; Grasha et al. 2019 ), BCG of 2A0335 + 096 ( z 0.035; McNamara, Bregman & O\u2019Connell 1990 ), PKS 1519 + 07 NGC 5920) in MKW3s ( z = 0.044; McNamara et al. 1990 ), UGC 489 in A407 ( z = 0.045; Shulevski et al. 2015 ), PKS 0915-11 Hydra-A) in A780 ( z = 0.055; Taylor 1996 ), Cygnus-A ( z = 0.056; onway & Blanco 1995 ; Struve et al. 2010 ), PKS 1346 + 268 in 1795 ( z = 0.064; van Bemmel et al. 2012 ), PKS 2322-123 in A2597 z = 0.082; O\u2019Dea, Baum & Gallimore 1994 ; Taylor et al. 1999 ), KS 1555-140 ( z = 0.097; Curran et al. 2006 ), PKS 1353-341 ( z 0.223; V \u0301eron-Cetty et al. 2000 ). The H I profiles are detected against the strong central AGN ctivity of these cool-core cluster/group BCGs. The profiles have idths between 100 and 1000 km s \u22121 and column densities between 0 21 \u221210 23 cm \u22122 , similar to our detection against Norma\u2019s BCG. o we ver, unlike our detection, most of these detections have a road associated component and a narrow redshifted/blueshifted omponent (Morganti & Oosterloo 2018 ). These detections are seen s evidence for a surrounding \u2018cooling flow\u2019 being responsible for he presence of H I , which feeds the AGN activity of these BCGs Hogan 2014 ). But it is difficult to draw direct comparisons between he environment of these BCGs and that of ESO 137-G006. For xample, NGC 1275 in Perseus is the closest (albeit further than SO 137-G006) cool-core cluster BCG detected with H I and it has cluster environment that is as massive and complex as that of SO 137-G006 (Boehringer et al. 1996 ; Woudt et al. 1998 ; Sun t al. 2009 ). Ho we ver, first, NGC 1275 is located in Perseus\u2019 large ool-core, whereas Norma has a rarer and smaller cool-core, of the uminous corona type, associated with ESO 137-G006\u2019s strong AGN Sun et al. 2007 , 2009 ; Nishino et al. 2012 ). Secondly, the 1.4-GHz uminosity of NGC 1275\u2019s AGN is only 65 per cent that of ESO\n1 s m M u d\na a t\n4\nT w p T c a e p t l s l\nM M e l ( W b o S t a H\n1 c t g s d fl c c G b\n4\nI c e p h a s u c i\ng n ( v C t o\nm w A b 2 T N S 2 c S b p c c q t\n5\nU h o c ( 2 k v d s ( ( d h t\n( T ( a c E a f 2\nb p O G h i l E B\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/519/3/4128/6939833 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\n37-G006\u2019s AGN (Sun et al. 2009 ). Lastly, despite the presence of trong AGN feedback, NGC 1275 is exceptionally found with cold olecular gas and a high SFR ( \u223c 41 Myr \u22121 ) near its core (FrasercK elvie, Bro wn & Pimbblet 2014 ). Thus, NGC 1275 cannot be sed to argue for a cooling flow origin for the cold gas that has been isco v ered in ESO 137-G006. In short, our findings are only partly consistent with the H I bsorption properties detected towards other cool-core cluster BCGs nd we cannot confirm that the H I in ESO 137-G006 is present due o Norma\u2019s central cooling flow.\n.4 Sub-cluster merger in Norma\nhe X-ray distribution of Norma is not spherically symmetric, hich indicates that Norma is not in dynamic equilibrium and is ossibly ongoing a sub-cluster merger (Boehringer et al. 1996 ; amura et al. 1998 ). The observed X-ray sub-cluster, due to its ompactness, suggests that the merger has commenced recently nd not progressed very far (Boehringer et al. 1996 ). Norma\u2019s lliptical/spheroidal population is relaxed and the spiral/irregular opulation is distributed in various substructures. But both of hese galaxy populations are aligned along the nearby dominant arge-scale structure, the Norma W all (W oudt et al. 2008 ). So, the ub-cluster merger has been associated with the formation of this arge-scale structure (Nishino et al. 2012 ).\nThe X-ray sub-cluster is aligned, in projection, with the 843- Hz radio continuum emission of ESO 137-G006\u2019s WAT (Jones & cAdam 1996 ; Woudt et al. 2008 ), placing this BCG at the leading dge of this sub-cluster merger. Furthermore, there is an observed ine-of-sight velocity offset between the mean cluster velocity 4871 \u00b1 54 km s \u22121 ) and that of ESO 137-G006 (5441 \u00b1 52 km s \u22121 ;\noudt et al. 2008 ). So, it is possible that ESO 137-G006\u2019s WAT is ent due to the ram-pressure e x erted on it as the BCG mo v es, as part f the sub-cluster, through the dense ICM (Owen & Rudnick 1976 ; akelliou & Merrifield 2000 ). Altogether, these observations suggest hat ESO 137-G006 may have recently merged with the cluster core s a consequence of the merger interactions, thereby retaining some I from its formation stages. In summary, it is possible that some cool-core BCGs, like ESO 37-G006, are young radio galaxies that retain small amounts of old gas in their core despite internal e v aporation or stripping from heir sub-cluster environments. Compared to other central dominant alaxies of low redshift ( z < 0.03) massive ( M \u223c 10 15 M ) clusters uch as Coma and Perseus, Norma\u2019s BCG is the only one with etected intrinsic H I gas that is not associated with a cluster cooling ow. This suggests that detectable H I gas associated with the radio ore of massive (i.e. M \u223c 10 15 M ) cluster BCGs is likely to be less ommon. Our results are consistent with the scenario that ESO 137- 006 may have recently moved into the cluster centre as opposed to eing Norma\u2019s original BCG at the bottom of its potential well.\n.5 Limitations and impro v ements\nmaging these observations with the standard imaging process is hallenging as the targeted region has multiple sources of strong xtended continuum that are within and adjacent to each ATCA ointing, which has a wider-field nature at 1.4 GHz relative to igher frequencies. In addition, our observations are significantly ffected by sidelobes due to the insufficient uv -co v erage and limited urface brightness sensitivity of ATCA\u2019s 6A array configuration, sed for achieving the highest spatial resolution. The limited uv - o v erage and significant sidelobe effects result in a baseline ripple n the line spectra after imaging. Moreo v er, the detection of Norma\u2019s\nalaxy members has been incomplete to date due to its location ear the Galactic plane - the optical and infrared zone of a v oidance ZOA). Thus, the estimates of Norma\u2019s mean cluster velocity and elocity dispersion remain highly uncertain (Woudt et al. 2008 ). onstraining the kinematics of this cluster could, in turn, constrain he mo v ement of ESO 137-G006 with respect to it and thus impro v e ur understanding of the role of H I in the BCG\u2019s evolution. Future H I surv e ys that can see beyond the ZOA will reveal uch of the Universe that remains largely understudied at shorter avelengths. With the use of the Australian Square Kilometre rray Pathfinder (ASKAP), the upcoming Wide-field ASKAP L - and Le gac y All-sk y Blind surv eY (WALLABY, Koribalski et al. 020 ) can help detect H I emission in and around the Norma cluster. hese H I emission detections could then be used to better constrain orma\u2019s kinematics and merger history . Additionally , other future quare Kilometre Array (SKA) pathfinders surv e ys (e.g. Gupta et al. 021 ; Allison et al. 2022 ) are deeper, have more complete uv - o v erage, and hav e greater angular resolution than our ATCA data. o, more detailed solutions for continuum subtraction of multiple right extended sources (e.g. peeling) can be applied to the SKA athfinders\u2019 data in the future. These surv e ys will also be equipped to onduct a comprehensive survey of cold gas in the BCGs of massive lusters. Therefore, future studies with such surv e ys may be able to uantify the fraction of massive cluster BCGs that are accreted into he cluster centre at a later stage of cluster evolution.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\nsing ATCA observations of high resolution and sensitivity, we ave detected H I associated with ESO 137-G006, the main BCG f the Norma cluster. The H I absorption source is located at the oordinates of the BCG [RA (J2000) = 16:15:03.7 and Dec. J2000) = \u221260:54:24.9], and is constrained within the BCG\u2019s MASS isophotal diameter. The velocity centroid (5444 \u00b1 7 m s \u22121 ) of the H I absorption profile is coincident with the BCG\u2019s elocity (5441 \u00b1 52 km s \u22121 Woudt et al. 2008 ). Moreover, the etected profile is symmetric and narrow ( W 20 = 150 \u00b1 22 km s \u22121 ), uggesting the gas may be settled in a disc within ESO 137-G006 G 15 ). The spectral index ( \u03b1 = 0.3 \u00b1 0.2) of the likely compact < 3 kpc) radio core (65 \u00b1 18 mJy) in the background of this etection suggests that the AGN activity in ESO 137-G006 may ave restarted. Ho we ver, we do not have the required observations o investigate if the H I is feeding the AGN.\nThe estimated density of the H I absorption column is N H I \u2248 1 . 3 \u00b1 0 . 2) \u00d7 10 20 T spin cm \u22122 . We constrain the spin temperature, spin \u2264 194 K, from the upper limit of emission non-detection M H I \u2264 1 . 7 \u00d7 10 9 M ). The low spin temperature suggests that the bsorption column is in the cold neutral phase. Whereas the high olumn density, consistent with the cold gas properties of other TGs, suggests that small amounts of cold molecular gas could lso be present in this BCG\u2019s core without triggering significant star ormation (Morganti et al. 2006 ; Oosterloo et al. 2010 ; Serra et al. 012 ; Davis et al. 2019 ). A \u2018cooling flow\u2019 origin of the H I within ESO 137-G006 cannot e confirmed since the detection is only partly consistent with the roperties of other cool-core cluster BCGs (Hogan 2014 ; Morganti & osterloo 2018 ). On the other hand, it is possible that ESO 137- 006 has recently arrived into Norma\u2019s core. So, the BCG may ave retained the H I from its formation stages, or attained it from nteractions, in the process of moving into the cluster core as the eading-edge of an ongoing sub-cluster merger.

This study is limited by our simple imaging process and the Norma luster\u2019s position near the Galactic plane. With data from future allk y surv e ys of the SKA pathfinders (e.g. Koribalski et al. 2020 ; upta et al. 2021 ; Allison et al. 2022 ), a more complete and detailed tudy of Norma can be conducted. A comprehensive census of H I ssociated with other BCGs can also be taken. Such a census would rovide the high statistics needed to determine if the presence of old-gas can help identify the BCGs that have been accreted into the luster at a later stage in cluster evolution.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the referee for constructive comments that improved this anuscript.

(C1)\nThe profile edges are measured at the channels where the profile eets or exceeds the 0 mJy line in the smoothed and baseline ubtracted line spectrum. To calculate the H I properties, the same rofile edges are assumed for both the line spectra without and ith smoothing. All the H I properties calculated in this paper are ummarized in Table D1 .

To showcase his, we extract the line and continuum spectra, from their respective pectral and continuum cubes, o v er the square aperture centred at A (J2000) = 16:15:04 and Dec. (J2000) = \u221260:54:26. This square perture co v ers ESO 137-G006\u2019s core and, whilst bigger than the H I etection region, is small enough to exclude any continuum structure rom ESO 1370-G006\u2019s WAT lobes. We repeat the same analysis etailed in Section 3 on the spectra from the square aperture and resent our results in Fig. D1 and Table D1 . All the spectra, baselines, haded regions and vertical and horizontal lines in Fig. D1 have the ame colour and style as their respecti ve comparati ve pair figure (i.e. ig.

To confirm smoothing does not affect the I properties, we perform the analysis on both the sets of spectra: ith smoothing and without smoothing. As in Section C , we also emo v e the residual baseline ripple seen in Fig. D1 (a), by subtracting second-order polynomial baseline fit within the velocity range, 940 < v < 6961 km s \u22121 (see Fig. D1 b). The resulting second-order olynomial is given by equation D1 and is the same regardless of moothing. The change in the baseline about 0 mJy depending on he aperture (i.e. between Figs C1 b and D1 b) is a result of the nonaussian noise properties caused due to the limited uv -co v erage and ignificant sidelobe effects (see Section 4.5 ). The baseline subtracted ine spectra are shown in Fig. D1 (c):\nS\nmJy = \u22127 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ( v km s \u22121 )2 + 9 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ( v km s \u22121 ) \u2212 32 . (D1)\nThe profile is identified within the velocity range, 5358 < v < 557 km s \u22121 , which co v ers fiv e less channels than the profile from he elliptical aperture (see Fig. 2 b). We calculate the RMS spectral oise, in all the line-free channels in the velocity range, 3940 < v 6961 km s \u22121 , to be 6 and 9 mJy in the spectra with and without moothing, respectively.\nWe replicate the analysis in Fig. 2 in the panels (d) and (e) of ig.
