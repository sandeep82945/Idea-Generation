Exploration of Other Ionic Liquid Monomers for PIL Synthesis: Investigate the synthesis and gas separation performance of PILs derived from other ionic liquid monomers, especially those with different cationic species or innovative anionic counterparts. This could help in identifying PILs with even higher gas separation efficiencies or those that are more selective for specific gas pairs, expanding the range of applications for PIL-based membranes.

Development of Mixed Matrix Membranes (MMMs) with PILs: Incorporate synthesized PILs into mixed matrix membranes by blending them with other polymeric materials or incorporating inorganic fillers. This approach can aim to synergistically combine the properties of PILs with those of other materials to enhance mechanical strength, gas permeability, and selectivity. The performance of these MMMs could be compared against pure PIL-based membranes to assess improvements in gas separation processes.

Mechanical Reinforcement and Scaling Up of PIL Membranes: Given the challenges associated with the mechanical strength of PIL films, research could focus on novel cross-linking strategies or the development of composite materials that include PILs to improve their mechanical properties. Additionally, studies could investigate the scalability of producing these reinforced or composite PIL membranes for industrial applications, focusing on maintaining gas separation performance while ensuring the membranes are robust and durable.

Investigating the Impact of Membrane Thickness on Separation Performance: Conduct systematic studies to understand how the thickness of the PIL layer in composite membranes affects gas separation performance, including permeability and selectivity. Research could explore optimizing the membrane structure, possibly through layer-by-layer assembly or other fabrication techniques, to achieve the best balance between gas flux and separation selectivity.

Real-World Application Testing and Membrane Lifetime Assessment: Pilot studies could be conducted to test the performance of PIL-based membranes under real-world conditions, such as natural gas purification or carbon capture from industrial flue gases. These studies would not only validate laboratory findings but also assess the long-term stability and durability of PIL membranes in operational environments. Additionally, research could explore regeneration or recycling strategies for PIL membranes to enhance their sustainability and economic viability.
