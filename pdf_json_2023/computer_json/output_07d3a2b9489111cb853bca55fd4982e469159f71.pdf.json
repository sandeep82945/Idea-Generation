    "abstractText": "Monitoring critical infrastructure is of great importance for resilience against current and emerging hazards. In Canada, at the national level, critical infrastructure is strategically classified into the following 10 sectors: energy and utilities, finance, food, transportation, government, information and communication technology, health, water, safety, and manufacturing. Many of these critical infrastructures may be effectively monitored using emerging technologies such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR). LiDAR technology enables active remote sensing from airborne and terrestrial systems. Accordingly, LiDAR can be used in a wide range of applications related to the monitoring of critical infrastructure to promote resilience. This survey provides a comprehensive, and structured literature overview of LiDAR technology currently available for commercial and research use, and also provides a detailed review of the relevant applications of LiDAR for critical infrastructure monitoring. Several LiDAR-based applications in areas of critical infrastructure such as terrestrial and air transportation, gas, oil, and water pipelines, energy generation and distribution, and security are discussed. A summary of the LiDAR data sets that are currently available for use is also presented. INDEX TERMS Critical infrastructure monitoring, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), 3D point clouds.",

            "text": "INDEX TERMS Critical infrastructure monitoring, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), 3D point clouds.\nI. INTRODUCTION In Canada, critical infrastructure is strategically classified into several sectors, namely energy and utilities, finance, food, transportation, government, information and communication technology, health, water, safety, and manufacturing [1]. Active and continuous monitoring of critical infrastructure is required to promote resilience to a broad range of potential hazards. A range of sensing technologies, such as cameras, radar, satellite imagery, and seismographs, are available for such monitoring systems. LiDAR is a safe, relatively inexpensive emerging sensing technology that provides a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the environment, from which actionable conclusions may be extracted via data analysis and machine learning (ML) techniques.\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Okyay Kaynak .\nLiDAR can be used in a wide range of applications related to the monitoring of critical infrastructure to promote resilience. Comprehensive survey on different types of LiDAR [2], [3], [4] have been extensively studied by the researchers. Individual surveys on different applications of LiDAR in road transportation [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], air transportation [10], [11], [12], [13], railway [14], [15], electrical power transmission [16] and people tracking [17] are present in literature. Several LiDAR databases are also available for post processing applications [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. However, a comprehensive survey that includes all different applications of LiDAR for infrastructure monitoring along with databases is not present in literature. The motivation behind this work was to highlight the different fields of application of LiDAR for critical infrastructure monitoring in a single survey to facilitate the advancement of research in LiDAR technology.\n314 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ VOLUME 11, 2023\nAll the above mentioned surveys incorporate the recent trends in the application of LiDAR technology for infrastructure monitoring using ML techniques. The most commonly used ML techniques are support vector machines (SVM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), principle component analysis (PCA) and k-means. Table 1. shows some survey papers and their applicability along with limitations of each.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the LiDAR technology, including its strengths and limitations, is explained. Section 2 also includes a discussion of publicly available LiDAR data sets for critical infrastructure monitoring. In Section 3, various applications of LiDAR for monitoring critical infrastructure, including transportation (road, rail, and air), pipelines (oil, gas, water), electrical power transmission and distribution equipment, mining, and security, are discussed. The paper concludes with recommendations for incorporating LiDAR for enhancements to the resilience of critical infrastructure in Canada in Section 4.\nII. LiDAR TECHNOLOGY This section provides background information for LiDAR technology. First, we briefly explain the different types of LiDAR and their most common specifications. Next, we explore the publicly available LiDAR data sets.\nThere are two types of optical remote sensing systems: passive and active. While passive remote sensing uses solar energy to measure the scattered light, active systems transmit signals and measure the scattered signal from objects [20]. Since the signals transmitted in active remote sensing are known, the measurement of the received signals is more controlled, which results in reduced artifacts. LiDAR is a form of active remote sensing.\nLiDAR is a technology that employs light to measure the distance (range) from the measuring device to targets [20] and uses time of flight (ToF) to detect targets. There are two main techniques employed by LiDAR systems: pulsed and continuous-wave laser. Pulsed LiDAR sends small bursts of energy to the target to measure the intensity (amplitude) of the reflected signals. The continuous-wave laser transmits a modulated signal and measures the phase difference between transmitted and received signals [20]. The time difference between the transmitted and received signal enables the computation of the distance from the LiDAR device to the target obstacles. LiDAR active remote sensing can be used on airborne, spaceborne, and terrestrial applications [20].\nA. TYPES OF LiDAR There are different types of LiDAR technologies. The two available LiDAR types based on the platform are terrestrial and airborne. Most of the LiDAR systems commercially available are composed of rotating parts, where the laser beam scans 360\u25e6 around the LiDAR axis. ToF cameras, on the other hand, usually do not have a rotating part and can measure multiple points without changing the position of the sensor. They also measure shorter distances than LiDAR systems with a laser beam. In this section, different types of LiDAR technologies and methods of data collection are explored."

            "heading": "1) AIRBORNE",
            "text": "For airborne LiDAR, the data collection system is installed on an airplane, a helicopter or a drone. The light is transmitted from the airborne system to the ground, and the scattered light is detected by the system while in motion [21]. There are two main types of airborne sensors: the topographic and the bathymetric LiDAR.\na: TOPOGRAPHIC LiDAR Topographic LiDAR collects surface cloud points that represent the elevation of the Earth\u2019s surface. This type of LiDAR is used in forestry, hydrology, geomorphology, urban planning, landscape ecology, coastal engineering, survey assessments, and volumetric calculations [21]. A topographic LiDAR sensor is given in Fig. 1.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 315\nb: BATHYMETRIC LiDAR The bathymetric LiDAR is used to simultaneously measure the distance from the airborne system to the top layer of the water, as well as the ocean/sea\u2019s depths. Infrared laser is commonly used to measure the topography, and in the case of bathymetric LiDAR, an extra green laser is used to measure the bottom of ocean/sea bodies, providing two different measures. These measurements can then be used to extract the ocean/sea\u2019s depths and shoreline elevations [21]. This type of LiDAR is typically used for deployment near coastlines, shores and river banks or protecting harbours. It can also be used to locate objects on the ocean floor. Airborne LiDAR bathymetry (ALB) can be used to monitor the morphology of rivers with high degrees of accuracy [23]. Based on LiDAR applications such as detecting coral reefs, one can conclude that LiDAR can be used for monitoring water bodies for effects of climate change. Fig. 2 shows a bathymetric LiDAR sensor."

            "heading": "2) TERRESTRIAL LiDAR",
            "text": "Terrestrial LiDAR can be divided into two main classes: mobile and static. Mobile terrestrial LiDAR is mounted on a moving platform such as a vehicle, train or a boat while static terrestrial LiDAR is mounted on a tripod or a stationary device. Both types of LiDAR employ eye-safe lasers. These radars are used to conduct surveys on rails and highways, manage facilities, or create highly accurate 3D models for interior and exterior spaces [21].\na: MOBILE The system usually consists of the LiDAR sensor along with additional sensors such as global positioning systems (GPS), inertial navigation systems (INS), and cameras. This type of system is used to obtain the location of encroaching overhead\nwires, high poles, road signs near roadways or rail lines [21]. Fig. 3 provides an example of mobile terrestrial LiDAR that was used to obtain details about the shore line, the point cloud view, the view after filtering the data and the cross-shore profile view.\nb: STATIC Static LiDAR can be used to acquire data points from interior of buildings as well as external structures. This makes static LiDAR useful in areas such as engineering, mining, surveying, and archaeology [21]. Fig. 4 shows an example of static terrestrial LiDAR sensor.\nB. HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS Most commercially available LiDAR sensors are configured with onboard data acquisition hardware. Data is typically transmitted from the LiDAR sensor to the computer through USB 3.0 or Ethernet cable which may vary with the manufacturer. For instance, the Velodyne-Alpha Prime model, providing ultra-high resolution 3D point clouds of the surrounding environment, transmits data using Ethernet connection: 1000BASE-T (IEEE 802.3ab) with a bit rate of 125 megabits per seconds [27]. Ethernet user datagram protocol (UDP) and transmission control protocol (TCP) are the basic communication protocols that are generally used.\n316 VOLUME 11, 2023\nThe computer on receiving the data acquired by the LiDAR sensor, must be able to visualize and process it. Manufacturers provide graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize and convert the the real-time raw sensor data into a machine-readable format along with software development kit (SDK) to customize the sensor data acquisition. These GUIs and SDKs are unique to the manufacturers of the LiDAR and vary from one manufacturer to the other. An example of one such GUI is the VeloView by Velodyne. It performs real-time data visualization of live streamed 3D LiDAR data from Velodyne\u2019s sensors, namely, HDL-64E, HDL-32E, VLP-32, VLP-16, Puck, Puck LITE, Puck Hi-Res, Ultra Alpha, Alpha Prime, Velarray, Velabit, Veladome. VeloView also provides raw sensor data in.CSV format and custom color maps of intensityof-return, time, distance, azimuth, dual return type, and laser id for post-processing. Manufacturers also provide post-processing workflow platforms. These platforms provide additional functionality of post-processing of the collected raw data as compared to GUIs. A popular example of such workflow platform is HxMap by Leica Geosystems. The workflow of HxMap involves data pre-processing followed by geometrical and radiometric data adjustment followed by product generation (LiDAR 3D models or customized templates). Leica Cyclone Cloud is another cloud-based software service by Leica Geosystems [28].\nC. DIFFERENTIAL ABSORPTION LiDAR (DIAL) Differential absorption LiDAR (DIAL) is a laser remote sensing method that is applied for measurements of atmospheric gas concentrations. DIAL employs two different frequencies to measure the scattered light through a medium. Each wavelength interacts differently with the medium; one of the wavelengths gets attenuated more than the other. Thus, the back-scattered light from each of these wavelengths is different and can be used to compute the concentration of different constituents of the medium. The DIAL has proven to be useful to measure tropospheric concentrations of NO, H2O, O3, SO2, and CH4, as well as ozone levels [29]. DIAL is highly relevant for infrastructure monitoring as it can detect hydrocarbon concentrations [30], allowing the inspection of pipelines covering big distances in short amounts of time.\nD. FLUORESCENT LASER SPECTROMETER (FLS) LiDAR Fluorescent laser spectrometer (FLS)-LiDAR uses hyperspectral detectors to collect laser data. This allows subsequent data analysis systems to determine qualitative and quantitative analyses of both water bodies and land surfaces, offering an integrated environmental assessment based on airborne surveys [31].\nE. LiDAR DATA SETS The number of available LiDAR data sets over the last few years has been steadily increasing. These data sets have files with large amounts of data. Usually, airborne-based LiDAR data sets are subdivided into map regions to break down the\ndata into smaller geographical areas. The Canadian LiDAR data [32] presents LiDAR data sets from Canada, open for free download and download with restrictions. Most of the data sets, if not all of the data sets listed in [32], have raw LiDAR data collected from airborne systems, but they do not have data annotations for infrastructure classification tasks using supervised ML approaches.\nThe OpenTopography website [33] provides a list of data sets from around the world. The user can go through a list of websites or zoom into a world map that is available on the website and select the region of interest. Normally, the OpenTopography website includes data sets from a variety of streams: airborne LiDAR, terrestrial laser scanner (TLS), bathymetric data, satellite data, and structure from motion/photogrammetry. Some of the data sets even allow comparison between measurements collected on different occasions. Some of these data sets were collected after natural disasters, such as the hurricane Harvey in 2017, to evaluate the magnitude of the flood, determine the probability of occurrence, and map the extent of the flood in Texas [34]. Data recorded from environments after disasters can be valuable for monitoring the safety of infrastructures that are crucial for relief operations and safety of the people in the affected regions. For example, may be identified and monitored for maintenance and safety purposes. Further identification of specific areas where maintenance is required can also be very valuable under such circumstances.\nAirborne-based LiDAR data sets for semantic segmentation can also be found in the literature. The DublinCity data set presented in [35], available for download in [36], covers around 2km2 of annotated point clouds. Fig. 5 (red boxes around the annotated areas) and Fig. 6 (the class hierarchy) show an overview of the DublinCity data set. The LiDAR data was collected from a helicopter airborne laser scanner (ALS) system and includes around 260 million labeled points.\nThe Dayton annotated laser earth scan (DALES) data set, presented in [38] and available for download in [39], consists of point cloud data collected from ALS, with around 5 billion hand-label points over 10km2 and has 9 major categories:\nVOLUME 11, 2023 317\nground, vegetation, cars, trucks, poles, power lines, fences, buildings, and unknown. Fig. 7 shows color-coded tiles for the different classes available on this data set. The intersection over union (IoU) is a common metric to evaluate a machine learning model on point cloud classification. The authors in [38] reported an IOU of 95.5% for power lines and 75% for poles. Annotated power lines, poles, and buildings are useful for monitoring and classification of critical infrastructure areas such as energy, utilities, and safety.\nInitiatives for semantic segmentation using terrestrial data can be found in the literature [40], [41]. The Toronto-3D data set presented in [40] is available for download at [42], while the Paris-Lille data set presented in [41] is available for download at [43]. The Toronto-3D data set includes the 3D data points collected using a vehicle-mounted system, and has 8 labeled classes: road, road marking, natural, building, utility line, pole, car, and fence. This type of data set is an important step towards semantic segmentation from LiDAR data, which could enable automated monitoring of classes of interest, including critical infrastructure.\nSemantic segmentation applied to self-driving vehicles can also be found in the literature. Table 2 shows a few data sets available in the literature that uses LiDAR for object segmentation (listed in [44]). While these data sets are focused on important objects for self driving cars, classes such as\npole ([45], [46]), traffic sign ([45], [46]), traffic light ([46]), bridge ([46]), tunnel ([46]), and tree ([47]), the information extracted from these data sets can be used for infrastructure monitoring and can provide useful information for activities such as planning and maintenance.\nIn summary, LiDAR is an emerging sensing technology that rapidly and inexpensively builds a 3Dmodel of the scene. It is safe to use near humans and is versatile in being able to survey multiple surfaces (e.g., both land and water). LiDAR can be mounted on a moving vehicle (e.g., plane, train) or in a fixed location. These qualities make LiDAR suitable for continuous monitoring of a wide range of critical infrastructure, as detailed in the following section. The availability of rich data sets enable the study of critical infrastructure protection viable and possible.\nIII. APPLICATION AREAS In this section, different applications of LiDAR, such as in monitoring road, rail, and air transportation, are studied. LiDAR-based approaches in monitoring critical infrastructures of pipelines and electrical power transmissions and distribution, mining, and nuclear plants are also reviewed. Besides, detection and tracking of people and safety of critical areas for security purposes are also discussed.\nThe following performance metrics are used in the evaluation of various methods in the literature: \u2022 Accuracy (correctness): the proportion of correct predictions (classifications) among the total number of cases examined.\nAccuracy = TP+ TN\nTP+ FP+ FN + TN (1)\nwhere TP is true positive, TN is true negative, FP is false positive and FN is false negative. \u2022 Precision (exactness): indicates the proportion of predicted positives that are true positives.\nPrecision = TP\nTP+ FP (2)\n\u2022 Recall (completeness): denotes what proportion of actual positives are correctly classified.\nRecall = TP\nTP+ FN (3)\nA. ROAD TRANSPORTATION Transportation unifies a nation, links various cultures of a nation, and strongly influences a nation\u2019s economy. Any\n318 VOLUME 11, 2023\ninterruption in the cycle of transfer of goods and services leads to considerable losses to a nation\u2019s economy. The recent emerging technology, such as self-driving cars, acquire and use information about the infrastructure. For instance, autonomous driving systems are required to have the ability to recognize the various objects on and to surround the roads. We review some of the modern LiDAR-based methods to monitor transportation infrastructures.\nLiDAR-based technology helps to extract information about road surface geometry and other existing objects in the roadway.

With emerging LiDAR technology, the use of LiDAR as a supplier of input information for 3D detectors is entirely reasonable. Because, by using the LiDAR point cloud information, it is possible to detect\nthe vertical distribution of the object on the ground.

LiDAR data is less sensitive to visual turbulence. Hence, LiDAR utilization is growing significantly in this area. Using the terrestrial mobile LiDAR data, a method called Progressive LiDAR adaptation-aided road detection (PLARD) has been developed on the KITTI benchmark. This method shows considerable robustness and promise as a better road detection method than other state-of-the-art road detection techniques.\nNormally, many autonomous driving vehicles use LiDAR devices to recognize road lanes. However, a sizable number of them are just able to detect uncomplicated roadway types. A method to detect all road features and parameters for complex streets with many lanes and signs like arrows, stop signs in real-time was proposed in [55].

Flight-path planning is another important\nfactor in the LiDAR system mission.

            "text": "There has been a significant increase in the air traffic over the last three decades, leading to a demand for better air safety measures. Adverse weather conditions andwind hazards pose a major threat during the landing and take-off of the aircraft. Abrupt changes in wind speed and wind direction, inadequate spacing of wake vortex separation, and gust measurement may dramatically influence the aerodynamic circumstances of the flight and may threaten the safety of the aircraft, causing about half of the air navigation system (ANS)-related accidents globally. Weather LiDAR prove to be a promising technology in addressing these threats in the following ways:\na: WAKE VORTEX MONITORING Wake vortex is a disturbance in the atmosphere that forms behind an aircraft as it passes through the air. Accurate remote detection and tracking of aircraft wake vortices along approach and departure corridors have gained significant interest in the past several years. Adequate separation time between aircrafts can reduce the probability of aircraft catastrophe. In nearly all cases, the sensor is set up to view the aircraft wake vortices with a vertical scan perpendicular to the aircraft flight track. This is called the transverse viewing geometry.\nPulsed Doppler LiDAR mounted on-board an aircraft are being extensively used for remote sensing of wake vortices. The LiDAR that is extensively used for wake vortex monitoring by the Japan aerospace exploration agency (JAXA), radiates 1543 nm laser pulses with a physical length of almost 50 m. These emitted pulses are scattered by aerosols flowing with air, and back-scattered light is received and digitally sampled. For each direction, sample data of 600 pulses at a pulse repetition frequency of 18 kHz are processed and accumulated, and measurements of carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR), mean radial velocity, velocity dispersion, and Doppler spectrum are output for each 5m range bins to a distance of nearly 900 m. Fig. 18 illustrates a sketch map of airport wake vortex monitoring.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 325\nb: WIND SHEAR DETECTION A terminal Doppler weather radar (TDWR) has been used to detect and warn low-level wind shear. While the TDWR has proved to be effective in rainy weather, reports received from aircraft pilots landing at or taking off from the airport indicate that low-level wind shear also occurs under clear-air conditions. In order to overcome this shortcoming, a Doppler LiDAR system was installed in mid-2002 to monitor wind flow around the airport [79].\nc: GUST AND MICROBURST MEASUREMENTS Gust fronts are elongated regions of converging flow and are often associated with a thunderstorm outflow but may also result from downslope wind conditions, cold fronts, sea breezes, and so on. An aircraft flying across a convergent flow region in either direction will experience a lift due to the apparently increased headwind. Microbursts are typically produced within thunderstorms and are characterized by an area of strong diverging surface flow that results from a significant downdraft from a thunderstorm cell. An aircraft encountering a microburst or similar negative shear will first experience an increasing headwind, which will increase the lift. However, soon after encountering the increased headwind, the aircraft encounters an increased tailwind after passing through the center of the downdraft (core). This causes a loss of lift and, unless properly countered, a dangerous and potentially fatal loss of altitude [80].\nCoherent pulse-Doppler LiDAR serves as a solution to the problem discussed in the previous paragraph. Installationdependent scans are conducted, and radial velocity data is collected along each averaged line of sight in the scan. The radial velocities quantify the wind speed component along the sensor line of sight. If the wind profile along a line of sight is sufficiently divergent by an amount consistent with adjacent lines of sight, the region is declared a wind shear or microburst.\nd: THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY: A COHERENT ALL-FIBER, MODULAR, COMPACT WIND LiDAR Currently, the most widely used commercial LiDAR system in the world is WindTracer LiDAR systems. Organizations including national aeronautics and space administration Langley research centre (NASA LaRC) have used the data collected from WindTracer systems for validation of fast time wake models [81]. However, commercially available WindTracer or custom-built LiDAR systems have several disadvantages such as they are (a) large and heavy, (b) subjected to high-maintenance, (c) suffering from reliability issues, and (d) often prohibitively costly.\nIn order to overcome the disadvantages of current systems, a long-range, versatile wind LiDAR with all-fiber architecture using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components was developed for wind and wake vortex sensing applications. The LiDAR system, known as Windimager, was developed by Sibell Optics under the NASA small business innovation\nresearch (SBIR) funding with emphasis on enhancing range, sensitivity, system efficiency and reliability and simultaneously reducing size, weight, and power (SWaP) and maintenance time [82]. Furthermore, it incorporated a novel 3D hemispherical scanner that was integrated into the LiDAR system. Modularity, reliability due to the Telcordia-tested COTS components, lower maintenance costs, a predominance of line-replaceable units, and cost-effectiveness are the pros of this system. Besides ground-based operations, this wind LiDAR technology also provides a viable technical path for airborne platforms.\nF. PIPELINES There are an estimated 840,000 kilometers of transmission, gathering, and distribution pipelines in Canada [83]. These pipelines are distributed in populated and remote areas of Canada, with 450,000 km of local distribution lines, 250,000 km of gathering lines, 117,000 km of large-diameter transmission lines (4\u2019\u2019-48\u2019\u2019), and 25,000 km of feeder lines.\nThe use of pipelines to transport oil and gas is considered safe, reliable, and environment friendly [83]. However, in the long run, gas and oil pipelines will suffer from corrosion and weld defects [84]. The most common failures in gas pipelines are cracking and perforation, while for the oil pipelines, it is perforation [84]. Monitoring these pipelines is, therefore, important for the prevention of accidents and heavy environmental and personal losses [84]."

Active methods can be used to transmit signals above the pipeline and then measure the amount of absorption for a given constituent [85].

According to [87], trapped moisture between the outer wall of the pipe and the protective coating is the main cause of SCC. LiDAR can be used to determine soil drainage based on high fidelity terrain data, and therefore, identify stress on the pipelines that can possibly cause SCC."

LiDAR technology is invaluable for disaster assessment. The authors in [88] collected both pre-trench and post-trench data to evaluate airborne and terrestrial LiDARmeasurements, and the reported bias and standard deviations indicate that it is possible to reliably detect ground displacements, which in turn can be used for detection of damage in some pipelines. In the event of an earthquake or large amounts of rainfall, airborne and terrestrial LiDAR can be used to compare the terrain during normal conditions and after the disaster to detect displacement hazards [88].\nG. ELECTRICAL POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT Applications of LiDAR technology in power transmission and distribution system involves risky objects\u2019 examination along the power line, adequate automatic clearances between conductors and objects, fine measurement of the interval between conductors, transmission line 3D visualization management, topography change detection along corridors, re-rating, vegetation evaluation and management along transmission line [89].

The inspection of the RoWs is one of the major responsibilities of operating and maintaining power transmission grids. RoWs are vulnerable to potential hazards (e.g., icing), resulting in short- or long-term power outages. The ROW clearance anomaly detection measures the distance between the power lines and the surrounding non-power-facility objects in the corridor such as trees and buildings to judge whether the clearance is within the safe range. Traditional methods used for monitoring the high voltage (HV) transmission lines mainly rely on aerial- and ground-based human on-site inspections with optical measuring devices (e.g., telescope and video/infrared camera) to manually detect the defects such as faulty components or encroaching vegetation. These methos were automated using the LiDAR technology [90].\nLiDAR acquires the spatial geometry of the detected object in the form of discrete 3D point clouds. ALS has become one of the primary information sources for the ROW inspection. The standard manned aircraft (e.g., helicopter) borne ALS LiDAR systems are limited because of the inflexibility and high costs of the fight acquisition. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)s provide an alternative to the traditional remote sensing platforms. Using UAV LiDAR data to detect the ROW clearance anomaly can effectively improve the flexibility and mobility of the power line inspection and save a large number of manpower, material resources and time cost in the manned aerial vehicle or manual inspection. It is particularly important for transmission lines inspection in difficult terrains, such\nas mountainous regions [91]. The methodology involved uses the following steps:\n1) Extraction of the power line point clouds, 2) Fitting the power line point clouds segments iteratively\nwith 3D catenary curve model, 3) Combining the constructed 3D power line catenary,\npoints of non-power-facility objects and the digital elevation model (DEM).\nThe Delair DT26 LiDAR fixed-wing drone is perfectly fitted for long-distance corridor mapping of power lines [92]."

Robot inspection uses a cable inspection robot as a motion platform. According to different inspection objects, robot inspections can be divided into substation robot inspection and CIR inspection. Substation robot inspection is used to replace manual inspection to execute substation inspectionwork [93]. CIR is a power robot traveling along the ground wire, so it can reach rugged terrain, e.g., mountains, forests, and lakes, and it can carry out a fine inspection in these regions. Fig. 22 shows the mechanical structure of CIR. Besides, Fig. 23 and Fig. 24 presents a schematic diagram of data collection using CIR LiDAR system and the collected point cloud of actual lines."

Near the power lines, the presence of a tree\u2019s branch is a hazard and lead to power outage or interruption if it touches the overhead wires of the electrical distribution system. Therefore, it is necessary to have a plan for controlling the vegetation. To this end, LiDAR-equipped systems can play a useful role in this area. Using TLS and cameras, one can collect helpful images and point cloud data of the electrical distribution network. Then, by applying ML models to detect shapes in point clouds, one would be able to recognize electrical equipment and vegetation. This stage helps us to control and modify plants near the electrical poles.\nH. MINING Mining is of great importance to Canada as it contributes to the Canada\u2019s economy and industry. According to [94],\nCanada ranks in the top five producing countries for 13 major minerals and metals: first in potash; second in uranium and niobium; third in nickel, cobalt, aluminum and platinum group metals; and fifth in gold and diamonds.

LiDAR was later used to analyze the vegetation growth of the reclamation site.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 329\nThis analysis enabled forest managers to evaluate vegetation growth in areas from reclamation sites, as well as check the risk of erosion and landslides [96].\nI.

Radioactively contaminated materials were buried in radioactive waste temporary storage places (RWTSPs), also known as trenches and clamps, and these sites were poorly documented [100]. Today, many locations of RWTSPs remain unknown. The authors of [100] collected data from LiDAR and a multispectral camera mounted on a UAV system over the Chernobyl area. The LiDAR data was used to generate a DTM, while a multispectral camera was used to classify the trees on the map. The combination of LiDAR point cloud and the classification of the trees were used for later classification of all the cloud points to create probability maps of radioactive waste sites. Fig. 27 shows an overview of the proposed method for detecting radioactive waste sites implemented in [100].\nBriechle, Molitor, Krzystek, et al. [100] were able to localize the previously unknown 38 borings using the combination of LiDAR and multispectral imagery data. A classification accuracy of over 97% for DTM grid points was achieved. In addition, the F1 score for class trench was 0.76 for area #1 and 0.75 for area #2, but the authors in [100] expected a higher score as they speculated that the group errors were located in trenches that were not considered during manual labeling. Fig. 28 shows the classification of trenches and clamps, and conducted borings in the Chernobyl.\nJ. SECURITY Although the detection and tracking of people as not considered as a direct application of infrastructure monitoring, it plays an important role in securing the infrastructure against unauthorized access. A significant amount of research has\n330 VOLUME 11, 2023\nbeen done in this field using LiDAR. Thus, to highlight the potential application of LiDAR in security and broaden our scope of application, we have included this section.\nLiDAR can be used for securing critical infrastructure against unauthorized access. Oftentimes, access to critical infrastructures is allowed only for a select group of people. Detection and identification of such personal are therefore important for keeping critical installations safe. LiDAR offers certain advantages when compared to commercial camera systems. Color cameras require good illumination sources and have a limited distance range. Different illumination conditions affect the quality of images of the objects captured by the camera. Fig. 29 shows an example of the same image of an individual obtained with different illumination sources. The figure shows the camera images having different shadings. Infrared cameras provide improved performance in darker areas when compared to color cameras, but do not work for longer distances. LiDAR allows data collection at longer distances than color and infrared cameras, provides information about the size of the objects and is less susceptible to dark environments. In the following, LiDAR application for detection and tracking people is presented."

Texas Instruments (TI), a big provider and manufacturer of integrated components (IC), provides a LiDAR sensor (OPT8241) with QVGA resolution (320 \u00d7 240), with sampling rates as high as 150 frames per second, for as low as USD $26.69. While the price is only for the IC, it is clear that these sensors, and consequently systems, are becoming more affordable. TI recommends the use of the ToF sensor for the safety of critical areas and to count and identify people by extracting their skeletal structure [104]. These applications are highly relevant for monitoring critical infrastructure, and could be applied in sectors that are identified and prioritized by country.\nIV. CONCLUSION This survey has provided a survey of applications of LiDAR sensors in monitoring critical infrastructure. We have discussed different applications of LiDAR in monitoring road, railroad and air transportation systems, weather, bridges, ITS, pipelines, electrical power transmission and distribution equipment, mining, the safety of nuclear plants and also humans for security purposes. Transport agencies, governments, power stations, and construction companies all over the world have already started to embed such sensors into their streamlined processes to improve the infrastructure safety and to lower maintenance costs. Many countries have constructed efficient and robust railways with the help of LiDAR. The resiliency of railroad infrastructure is enhanced through improved risk prediction capability, enhanced infrastructure monitoring, and preemptive maintenance leading to avoid potential damages to the infrastructure. In order to realize an automated monitoring system, LiDAR sensors are mounted on trains to scan the railroads in a short amount\nVOLUME 11, 2023 331\nof time. LiDAR based monitoring thus reduces human involvement in rail surveys and also minimizes human errors. LiDAR technology is also used for automatic ground surveillance and securities in airports. Weather LiDAR technology has been used to improve the safety of air trafficmonitoring in adverse weather conditions. Passenger and aircraft safety can be enhanced through the creative use of LiDAR technology. LiDAR technology can provide maintenance authorities with valuable data for monitoring extreme loading and aging that can result in railroad bridge damage. Also, LiDAR sensors are used to discover range and depth data of transportation systems by active illumination by laser and obtaining the mirrored pulses. Different LiDAR technologies have been used in monitoring oil, gas and water pipelines for leak detection, stress corrosion cracking detection. The application of LiDAR in monitoring electrical power transmission and distribution equipment has been studied in detecting risky objects that may touch the power line. Further LiDAR can also help in identifying topography changes along corridors. Moreover, LiDAR has been used for monitoring mining sites and landscapes around it during exploration, mine-site design, closure, and reclamation. LiDAR systems embedded on UAVs make safe distance monitoring of nuclear plants possible. The use of LiDAR technology for infrastructure protection positively impacts the economy of the country and provides confidence to the public regarding safety.\nThe outcome of this research work shows that 3D LiDAR point cloud data provides a unique opportunity for automatic infrastructure monitoring applications. LiDAR systems are able to operate at high speed and provide point clouds that can be used to obtain accurate estimates and good classification results. Further, artificial intelligence and ML-based techniques have enabled advanced processing of LiDAR 3D point cloud data.\nIntegrators of LiDAR with other sensors are now readily available. As the cost of the LiDAR reduces, LiDAR may be used along with other stand-off sensors like radar to form an integrated multi-modal sensor. The sensed output of such an integrated sensor may be used with algorithm developed using artificial intelligence techniques to provide infrastructure protection. Such improved cost-effective sensors maybe available ubiquitously in the near future. Although LiDAR may not become the sensors of today but its day is soon to come.\nNormally, LiDAR point clouds represent huge data sets, both in terms of total size and data acquisition rate; therefore, future work should focus on developing solutions for efficient processing of LiDAR data in batch and in real-time. Deep learning algorithms are showing great promise in semantic segmentation tasks from LiDAR and from fused RGB and LiDAR data, and should continue to be pursued.\nCost never stops research from advancing. On the one hand, efforts to reduce the cost of LiDAR are being taken, engineering is advancing the quality of sensors. From a technology perspective, LiDAR is moving toward quantumenhanced sensing. Quantum sensors such as quantum radars\nand quantum LiDAR are being researched all over the world and quantum illuminating sensors seem to be the direction in which sensing technology is forging ahead.\nIn conclusion, LiDAR will be the sensor of choice for infrastructure protection in the coming years. As LiDAR technology matures, multi-modal sensing strategy will dominate. When quantum sensors become readily available, quantum LiDAR and quantum radar will be part of the advanced sensing systems for infrastructure protection.\nAPPENDIX A LIST OF ACRONYMS ALB Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry ALS Airborne Laser Scanner ANS Air Navigation System CIR Cable Inspection Robot CNN Convolutional Neural Network CNR Carrier to Noise Ratio COTS Commercial off-the shelf DALES Dayton Annotated Laser Earth Scan DEM Digital Elevation Model DIAL Differential Absorption LiDAR DTM Digital Terrain Model FLS Fluorescent Laser Spectrometer FOD Foreign Object Debris GNSS Global Navigation Satellite System GPS Global Positioning System HV high Voltage IC Integrated Component IMU Inertial Measurement Unit INS Inertial Navigation System IoU Intersection over Union JAXA Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency LiDAR Light Detection and Ranging ML Machine Learning PCA Principal Component Analysis PLARD Progressive LiDAR Adaption-aided Road Detection RANSAC Random Sample Consensus ROW Right-of-ways RTMS Road Traffic Monitoring System RWTSP Radioactive Waste Temporary Storage Places SCC Stress Corrosion Cracking SCFM Standard Cubic Feet per Minute SLAM Simultaneous Localization And Mapping SVM Support Vector Machines SWAP Size, Weight And Power TDWR Terminal Doppler Weather Radar TI Texas Instrument TLS Terrestial Laser Scanner ToF Time of Flight UAV Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\nACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by a research contract from Natural Resources Canada (NRCan).\n332 VOLUME 11, 2023\nREFERENCES\n[1] (2019).
