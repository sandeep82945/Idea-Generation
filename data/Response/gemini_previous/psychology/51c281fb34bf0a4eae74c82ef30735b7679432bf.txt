1. **Investigate the in vivo antioxidant and skin enzyme inhibitory activities of the isolated compounds (C-1 to C-7) using animal models.** This would provide more comprehensive data on the potential health benefits of these compounds and help determine their safe dosage range.


2. **Explore the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the isolated compounds to identify the structural features responsible for their antioxidant and skin enzyme inhibitory activities.** This information could be used to design and synthesize new compounds with improved biological activity.


3. **Investigate the potential synergistic effects of the isolated compounds when used in combination with other antioxidants or skin enzyme inhibitors.** This could lead to the development of more effective and broad-spectrum antioxidant and skin care products.


4. **Study the bioavailability and metabolism of the isolated compounds in humans.** This information is essential for determining the optimal dosage and formulation of these compounds for use in humans.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the isolated compounds or their extracts in the prevention or treatment of various diseases associated with oxidative stress and skin aging.** This would provide definitive evidence of the therapeutic potential of these compounds.
