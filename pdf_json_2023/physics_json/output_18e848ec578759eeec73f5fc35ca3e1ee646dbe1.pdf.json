    "abstractText": "Rapid urban industrialization and agricultural production have led to the discharge of excessive phosphate into aquatic systems, resulting in a rise in water pollution. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore efficient phosphate removal technologies. Herein, a novel phosphate capture nanocomposite (PEI\u2212PW@Zr) with mild preparation conditions, environmental friendliness, recyclability, and high efficiency has been developed by modifying aminated nanowood with a zirconium (Zr) component. The Zr component imparts the ability to capture phosphate to the PEI\u2212PW@Zr, while the porous structure provides a mass transfer channel, resulting in excellent adsorption efficiency. Additionally, the nanocomposite maintains more than 80% phosphate adsorption efficiency even after ten adsorption\u2013desorption cycles, indicating its recyclability and potential for repeated use. This compressible nanocomposite provides novel insights into the design of efficient phosphate removal cleaners and offers potential approaches for the functionalization of biomass\u2212based composites.",

            "text": "Phosphorus fertilizer is a crucial component of chemical fertilizers in agricultural production, facilitating plant resistance and growth [1]. However, high levels of phosphorus in the environment can have adverse effects [2,3]. For instance, the excessive use in agriculture can cause phosphorus to leach into surface water [4], while the use of domestic and industrial detergents can result in excess phosphate in wastewater, which can end up in water bodies [5]. A significant concern is when the phosphorus concentration in water bodies exceeds 0.01\u20130.02 mg\u00b7L\u22121, leading to toxic algal growth, overgrowth, and eutrophication [6]. Hence, it is critical to remove phosphorus from natural water bodies, particularly freshwater bodies, to prevent eutrophication. Phosphorus exists in pentavalent forms such as orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, long\u2212chain polyphosphate, and phosphodiester in the aqueous environment [7]. Figure S1 presents the structural formulas for these forms of phosphorus. These different phosphorus\u2212containing compounds can be hydrolyzed to orthophosphate, which is the only form that bacteria, algae, and plants can utilize [8]. Consequently, it is crucial to remove excess orthophosphate from water bodies [9,10]. Various methods for the removal of phosphate exist currently, including biological treatment [11], chemical co\u2212precipitation [12], reverse osmosis [13], electrodialysis [14], membrane separation [15], and adsorption [16]. Among these, the adsorption method is widely used in the field of wastewater treatment because of its high efficiency, environmental friendliness, recyclability, and flexibility in\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1807. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13111807 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1807 2 of 11\npreparation and separation, making it a promising approach for phosphorus capture in wastewater [17]. Several adsorbent materials have been explored for phosphate removal from water, including biochar [18], laponite [19], and biopolymers [20,21]. Despite the progress made, many prepared adsorbents exhibit drawbacks such as high cost, non\u2212recyclability, poor adsorption capacity, and low adsorption rate, thereby limiting their practical use [22]. Wood, as a renewable and carbon\u2212neutral resource, has emerged as an attractive raw material in the field of advanced materials [23,24]. Wood possesses numerous advantages, such as large specific surface area, regular pore channels, biodegradability, non\u2212toxicity, and diverse tunability through functional groups such as hydroxyl groups [25]. However, wood has poor adsorption performance for phosphates due to the abundance of electronegative functional groups, which hinder the adsorption of anions [26]. Therefore, modifying wood\u2212based materials is necessary to achieve effective phosphate adsorption. Recently, considerable research efforts have been focused on developing novel adsorbent materials modified with phosphate\u2212affinity components, such as lanthanum or Zr, to enhance their adsorption capacity for phosphate ions [27]. Among these, Zr\u2212based oxides have been identified as a promising adsorbent for phosphate removal due to their superior properties, including high thermal stability, low solubility in water, and resistance to oxidants and acids/bases [28,29]. Zr components not only endow adsorbents with ultra\u2212high adsorption affinity for phosphate, but also impart selectivity towards phosphate ions in water [30,31]. As such, incorporation of Zr components into modified wood\u2212based materials offers a potential approach for the efficient removal of phosphate from wastewater. In this study, a novel adsorbent material for phosphate removal from wastewater was prepared by modifying natural wood through a top\u2212down approach to obtain nanowood, followed by grafting polymerization to produce a porous and amino\u2212rich cross\u2212linked nanowood\u2212based material (PEI\u2212PW), and ultimately loading the Zr component on the nanowood matrix skeleton via the chelating effect of amino groups to prepare the Zr\u2212loaded nanocomposite (PEI\u2212PW@Zr). The adsorbent was subjected to comprehensive characterization to evaluate its potential for phosphate adsorption. To optimize the PEI\u2212PW@Zr formulation (Zr concentration) and investigate the effects of adsorbent dosage, adsorption time, temperature, pH of the solution, and the presence of coexisting anions on the adsorption efficiency of PEI\u2212PW@Zr for phosphate, a series of batch experiments were performed. Additionally, the cyclic regeneration performance of the adsorbent was examined."

After the adsorption reached equilibrium, the phosphate concentration was measured using a UV\u22122550 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The adsorption capacity of PEI\u2212PW@Zr was calculated by the Equation (1).\nqe = (C0 \u2212 Ce)V\nm (1)\nwhere C0 and Ce are the initial phosphate concentration (mg\u00b7L\u22121) and adsorption equilibrium phosphate concentration (mg\u00b7L\u22121), respectively, V is the volume of the solution (L), and m is the mass of PEI\u2212PW@Zr (g). To study the stability of PEI\u2212PW@Zr, a reusability experiment was conducted. An amount of 100 mg PEI\u2212PW@Zr was added to 100 mL 100 mg\u00b7L\u22121 phosphate solution until reaching the adsorption equilibrium. After the adsorption, the adsorbent was taken out and regenerated with 1 wt% NaCl solution by stirring for 1 h. Finally, the adsorbent was fully rinsed with DI water to remove the residual NaCl solution, and then regenerated PEI\u2212PW@Zr could be obtained for adsorption in succeeding cycles."

As the concentration of coexisting anions increased, the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for phosphate decreased, and the order of the effect on the adsorbent was SO42\u2212 > Cl\u2212 > HCO3\u2212. The observed results could be attributed to differences in the number of negative charges carried by the coexisting anions. Although the coexistence of anions affected the adsorption of phosphate by the adsorbent, it was generally within an acceptable range.\n3.2.8. Reusability\nThe reusability of adsorbents is a crucial factor in their practical application [41]. To evaluate the reusability of PEI\u2212PW@Zr as an adsorbent for phosphate, 1 wt% NaCl solution was used as the desorption agent. Figure 5d shows that after 10 cycles, the adsorption capacity of PEI\u2212PW@Zr decreased from 95.6 mg\u00b7g\u22121 to 77.3 mg\u00b7g\u22121, indicating that it exhibited excellent reusability. However, this reduction could be attributed to the existence of some phosphates that were tightly bound to the adsorbent and could not be completely removed during desorption. Interestingly, after the sixth adsorption\u2013desorption cycle, the adsorption capacity of PEI\u2212PW@Zr slightly increased, possibly due to the loosening of\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1807 9 of 11\nthe adsorbent structure after prolonged soaking in water, which exposed some previously hidden adsorption sites. Nevertheless, the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent remained stable and did not decline in subsequent cycles, suggesting that the number of irreversible binding sites did not increase. Overall, the as\u2212prepared PEI\u2212PW@Zr exhibited good reusability for phosphate in water.\n3.2.9. Adsorption Mechanisms Analysis\nIn this work, the successful adsorption of phosphate on PEI\u2212PW@Zr could be confirmed directly by FTIR, XPS, and TGA analyses. The phosphate adsorption by PEI\u2212PW@Zr mainly includes two adsorption mechanisms: (1) Electrostatic attraction: According to the FTIR and XPS spectra of the samples, amino groups and Zr components have been successfully introduced into the porous wood. Thus, under the acidic conditions, the residual amino groups could be protonated to positive charge to attract the phosphate anions. (2) Ligand exchange: Due to the strong affinity of Zr for phosphate, phosphate in aqueous solution binded to Zr in the as\u2212prepared PEI\u2212PW@Zr through ligand exchange, thereby completing adsorption."

The adsorption mechanism of the adsorbent was based on electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange processes. The results of this study demonstrate that PEI\u2212PW@Zr exhibited a high adsorption capacity (217.0 mg\u00b7g\u22121), and its adsorption kinetics and isotherm models were well described by the pseudo\u2212second\u2212order kinetics model and Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. In comparison with other powder adsorbents, PEI\u2212PW@Zr exhibited a significantly improved adsorption efficiency due to its bulk structure. Moreover, PEI\u2212PW@Zr demonstrated promising reusability with a retained adsorption capacity of over 80% after 10 regeneration cycles. Hence, the developed PEI\u2212PW@Zr has a potential for effective removal of excess phosphate from wastewater.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nano13111807/s1, Figure S1: The structures of orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, long\u2212chain polyphosphate, and phosphodiester.
