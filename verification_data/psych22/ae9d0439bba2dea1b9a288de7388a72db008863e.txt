Given the extensive text provided, the specific sentences or portions that directly mention future research directions are not explicitly highlighted. However, based on the context and typical structure of such papers, I can infer and paraphrase potential areas for future research that might be derived from the text:

1. **Personalization of Interventions Based on Personality Traits**: The paper discusses how students' personality traits, such as neuroticism and conscientiousness, impact the effectiveness of the robotic intervention. Future research could explore more personalized intervention strategies that tailor content and interaction styles to individual personality profiles to enhance efficacy.

2. **Long-Term Deployment Studies**: The text mentions the potential for longer deployment studies to further investigate the relationship between human-robot working alliance and intervention outcomes. Future research could focus on extended interactions to assess long-term effects on psychological well-being and the sustainability of behavior change.

3. **Behavioral Cues and Intervention Efficacy**: The paper highlights correlations between participants' verbal and nonverbal behaviors and the outcomes of the intervention. Future studies could delve deeper into developing computational models that predict the effectiveness of interventions based on real-time analysis of behavioral cues, enabling robots to adapt their strategies dynamically.

4. **Impact of Companion-Like Features and Proactive Behavior**: The text suggests that the robot's companionship and proactive behavior were positively received, indicating an area for further exploration on how these aspects of robot design contribute to building rapport and supporting mental health interventions.

5. **Privacy and User Control in Robotic Interventions**: Given feedback on privacy concerns and discomfort with the robot's proactive behaviors, future research could explore mechanisms for users to have greater control over the robot's behavior and data collection practices, ensuring comfort and trust in the technology.

These inferred directions align with the general themes and findings discussed in the paper, focusing on enhancing the personalization, effectiveness, and user acceptance of robotic interventions for mental health.
