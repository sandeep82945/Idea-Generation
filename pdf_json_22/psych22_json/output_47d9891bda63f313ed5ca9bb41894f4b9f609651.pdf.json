    "abstractText": "Objective: Schizophrenia is a complex functionally debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder, with associated social cognitive impairment. Corpus Callosum (CC) white matter tracts deficits are reported for people with schizophrenia; however, few studies focus on interhemispheric processing relative to social cognition tasks. This study aimed to determine if a relationship between the CC and social cognition exists. Method: In this cross-section study, a sample of n = 178 typical controls and n = 58 people with schizophrenia completed measures of mentalising (Reading the Mind in the Eyes), emotion recognition outcome and reaction time (Emotion Recognition Test), and clinical symptoms (Positive and Negative Symptom Scale), alongside diffusion-based tract imaging. The CC and its subregions, i.e., the genu, body, and splenium were the regions of interest (ROI). Results: Reduced white matter tract integrity was observed in the CC for patients when compared to controls. Patients performed slower, and less accurately on emotion recognition tasks, which significantly and negatively correlated to the structural integrity of the CC genu. Tract integrity further significantly and negatively related to clinical symptomatology. Conclusions: People with schizophrenia have altered white matter integrity in the genu of the CC, compared to controls, which relates to cognitive deficits associated with recognising emotional stimuli accurately and quickly, and severity of clinical symptoms.",

            "text": "Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately 1 in 300 people worldwide according to the World Health Organisation in 2022. Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia have an increased risk of early mortality, broad cognitive impairment, and altered psychosocial functioning, compared to the general population [1]. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 2021, the international prevalence rates are reportedly between 0.33\u20130.75%. There are various contributing factors to the development of schizophrenia, including genetic predisposition and polygenic risk [2],\nBrain Sci. 2022, 12, 1208. https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12091208 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/brainsci\nneuroinflammation [3], decreased synaptic spine density [4], cannabis use [5], psychosocial influences and reduced stress resilience [6], adverse childhood experiences and trauma [7], diminished anti-inflammatory response alongside reduced lipid metabolism [8], mitochondrial stress resilience [9], and gene\u2013environment interaction effects [10]. In line with this, the diathesis\u2013stress model may be a potential hypothesis accounting for the overall development of the disorder [11]. Schizophrenia is characterised by clinical symptoms, which significantly impact on everyday functioning [12]. Symptoms vary from person to person, though people with schizophrenia tend to experience a mixture of positive symptoms (i.e., delusions and hallucinations), negative symptoms (i.e., disorganized thought and behaviour, lack of motivation, restricted emotional awareness and apathy, social withdrawal, depression, and agitation), and cognitive impairment [13]. Cognitive deficits have been observed across multiple domains, including executive function, memory, attention, and social cognition [14], which correlate with functional neuroimaging studies [7,15\u201317]. Social cognition is a cognitive domain, which relates to several processes. These include individual and contextual perception and interpretation of behaviour [18], face, expression, and emotion recognition [19], as well as inferring the mental states of others [20]. These fundamental processes allow individuals to interpret, understand, and adapt to social situations on a behavioural level through shared attention and fundamental processes, such as gaze-orientation [21], and then respond appropriately to social cues and interactions in their environment [18]. Although aspects of social cognition are strongly linked to specified brain regions, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, temporoparietal junction, and medial prefrontal cortex, no singular anatomical region is responsible for all aspects of social cognitive functioning, in line with a network-based understanding of this cognitive domain [22\u201326]. It has been well established that people with schizophrenia have impaired social cognition [27], though how that relates to their clinical syndrome, white matter integrity, and speed of processing emotionally salient stimuli is less well known. Social cognitive functioning is an important domain for consideration for people with schizophrenia, as it is a reliable predictor of occupational functioning and independent living capacity [28], even in early psychosis [29], and to consider its relationship with white matter tracts not only informs us about neuroanatomical differences in schizophrenia but also the impact that has on clinical profiles and social cognitive outcomes. Functionally, reduced social cognitive ability directly relates to reduced social and occupational functioning [29] and reduced community-based integration [30] and leads to malfunctioning social exchanges [31]. There is substantial evidence of structural brain changes in schizophrenia. Altered white matter microstructure is commonly measured in terms of fractional anisotropy (FA), which reflects diffusion in tissue, with lower FA often taken to indicate reduced anatomical integrity [32]. Reduced FA has been associated with lower cognitive performance both in healthy individuals and patients diagnosed with schizophrenia [33,34]. In schizophrenia, reduced FA is correlated with more global cognitive functions, such as poorer processing speed, working memory, and executive functioning [35,36]. Clinical symptoms of schizophrenia have also been shown to be negatively associated with WM tracts frontotemporal regions [37,38], as well as cerebellar regions [39]. However, the association between lower FA and cognitive deficits does not appear to be accounted for by variation in clinical symptom severity [34,39]. Brain regions involved in aspects of social cognition, such as emotion perception and recognition, relate to both hemispheres and include the fusiform face area, which is a specialised brain region responsible for the recognition of faces [25], located in the inferior temporal lobe. Face perception is a more right hemisphere dominant process [40,41], with volumetric decrease in the right fusiform gyrus reported for people with schizophrenia [42] and reduced event related potentials when perceiving faces [43]. Notwithstanding these right-hemisphere specific findings, Nazeri and colleagues [44] report more left-lateralized decreased FA in a study of white matter integrity of forty-four participants with schizophre-\nnia, compared with typical controls, with additional studies highlighting lower WM integrity being associated with lower non-social cognitive domains, such as executive function [35], working memory [45], verbal memory [37], verbal and visual learning [39,46], and motor functioning [47]. Although there is growing evidence showing the relationship between white matter integrity and cognitive function, there is a paucity of research investigating the relationship to social cognitive outcomes. More specifically, while many of the aforementioned studies look at hemisphere-specific tracts, little to no studies have investigated the relationship between social cognitive outcomes and the corpus callosum (CC), which connects both hemispheres, and individually it has been identified as being impaired in people with schizophrenia [48]. Typically, the left hemisphere is more associated with language function [49], while the right hemisphere shows more evidence as dominant for emotion processing [50], yet tasks of social cognition typically require high functional ability in both these domains. Following surgical resection of the CC through corpus callosotomy typically for individuals with intractable epilepsy, for example, individuals are reported to have reduced capacity to interpret and identify emotion [51,52]. As such, interhemispheric tract integrity should be an area investigated specifically in relation to interhemispheric cognitive domains, such as social cognition. The CC itself can be further segmented into the genu, body, and splenium (anterior to posterior, respectively). In particular, Subramaniam and colleagues [53] identified specific localised regions of impairment in the CC, which included the genu and splenium. Further findings from DTI studies have shown reduced WM integrity of the CC and its relationship with reduced cognitive function [54]. Astroglia density has been shown to be abnormal in the anterior region of the CC for people with schizophrenia, which may relate to specific social cognitive deficits [55], with some studies showing pharmacological intervention improving in WM integrity within the genu of the CC [56]. Studies have also reported associations between emotion recognition [54], clinical symptoms [48], and perspective taking [12], particularly within the genu, splenium, and body of the CC. Findings in the literature have been moderately inconsistent, however, and most have been more focused on broader cognition domains, unlike this study, which focuses on individual facets of emotion recognition and reaction time, the relationship with structural integrity of the CC and its subregions, and clinical symptomology. Consequently, this study hypothesises that individuals with schizophrenia will have reduced FA within the CC and its anatomical subregions compared with typical controls. We further hypothesise based on the literature that reduced FA in the CC will relate to higher clinical symptoms as a proxy for syndrome burden and severity and lower social cognitive outcomes [12,48,54,57]."

The working group involved in the ENIGMA cohort for schizophrenia contains 29 groups/sites from 14 countries and hosts 4322 participants in total, with a breakdown of 2359 healthy participants and 1963 people who have a schizophrenia diagnosis. Both groups in the sample were well matched on age. Healthy participants, defined as \u2018typical controls\u2019, had an average age of 36.14 (M = 36.14) within an age range of 18 years to 86 years. Of the participants with a schizophrenia diagnosis, the average age was 36.22 (M = 36.22), with an age range of 18 to 77 years. Of the participants with a schizophrenia diagnosis, the average age of onset recorded was 23 years, while the average age of duration of the disorder was 14 years. The ENIGMA DTI pre-processing of diffusion images involved corrections and quality control (QC) procedures. This study fulfilled the ENIGMA procedures by the inclusion of pre-processing and QC steps involving eddy current echo-planar imaging corrections, which can both result in image distortion during diffusion imaging [60]. Tensor fitting was also included as a QC step. All DTI pre-processing and QC recommendations can be found at https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/dti-protocols/ (last accessed 1 September\n2022).

            "text": "This study aimed to investigate measures of social cognition and emotion recognition and their relationship to the structural integrity of the CC for people with schizophrenia relative to typical controls. This study observed reduced FA of WM tracts in the CC as a singular ROI, as well as its subregions: the genu, body, and splenium between patients and typical controls. Controlling for the overall difference in FA of all WM tracts, the main anatomical difference was evident in the genu of the CC, which was significantly related to positive symptomatology and poorer reaction time to correctly recognise emotions. Specifically, people with schizophrenia\u2019s reaction time to correctly identifying happiness was significantly and negatively associated with the FA in the genu of the CC after controlling for multiple comparisons. This could be for several reasons. One such reason\nmay include reduced inter-hemispheric communication in people with schizophrenia. As the CC is a commissural fibre, which connects the two hemispheres, the results of this study could indicate reduced interhemispheric speed of information processing. In essence, the findings propose that how long it takes a person with schizophrenia to correctly identify, decode, recognise, and ultimately respond to a happy face (happiness), which is related to the structural integrity of the CC, and more specifically, the genu. Furthermore, this study established that the greater the positive symptom severity (i.e., hallucinations, delusions) in patients, the lower the FA in the genu of the CC. Global and regional CC reductions in the genu [72], the body of the CC [73], and the splenium [72] has been established. According to a study by Koshiyama and colleagues [74], significant FA differences were identified in the CC and its subregions (the genu, body, and splenium), with similar findings showing decreased FA within the genu and body in a large sample of 287 people with schizophrenia and 193 typical controls [75]. Further studies have also identified specific and isolated abnormalities in the genu of the CC [76]. Moreover, a meta-analysis by Ellison-Wright and Bullmore [77] on chronic schizophrenia patients highlighted central anatomical regions where disconnection of WM were evident, which included the genu of the CC. Notwithstanding, individuals at high risk of developing schizophrenia, through genetic predisposition, have also been found to have deficits in WM integrity, prior to the onset or development of clinical symptoms, with lower FA observed in the CC of those at clinical ultra-high risk [39]. Klauser et al. [78] demonstrated significant reduction in FA for schizophrenia patients within the CC, using a mediation analysis to examine if medication could explain the reduction in anisotropy; however, no differences were identified between medicated and unmedicated patients. As part of the present study, clinical variables (i.e., symptom severity of schizophrenia) were evaluated. This finding is consistent with previous research, which found that decreased WM integrity in the CC was related to the severity of psychotic symptoms [79]. Our study is consistent with previous research showing social cognitive deficits in people with schizophrenia, compared with typical controls [80,81]. Patients had poorer recognition of emotional stimuli and also performed slower. This finding is in line with previous research. The fMRI studies have observed reduced activity within emotion recognition networks in people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia [82], and other studies have found that patients are worse at recognising emotions when compared with typical controls [12,83,84]. In the present study, schizophrenia patients showed a negative association between their reaction time to correctly identifying happiness and the structural integrity of the genu. The poorer the structural integrity within the genu of schizophrenia patients, the longer it took them to correctly identify happiness, which is in line with the work of Yang and colleagues [54]. Similarly within the literature, lower FA within the splenium correlates with poor social cognition scores [85]. Although this study had similar findings, it was not consistent following correction for multiple comparisons and correcting for the overall difference in WM FA. In line with our study, an earlier study by Zhao and colleagues [86] found reduced FA in the CC, which significantly correlated with emotion perception. Other studies have investigated the CC and clinical symptoms, though Fujino and colleagues [87] report significantly lower FA for schizophrenia patients, compared to typical controls, which negatively correlated with personal distress while controlling for positive and negative symptomology. Fujino and colleagues [87] concluded that reduced interhemispheric transference of information caused by disruption to the CC leads to longer interpretation time between information relating to the self and the environment."

            "text": "There are some limitations to outline in this study. Although this study showed specific differences in white matter integrity between patients and controls, the data did not include specific left\u2013right hemispheric tract breakdowns, where other studies have\nidentified left\u2013right differences of the CC [88]. Future research could replicate studies like the current study to include left\u2013right hemispheric segmentations and investigate their link to social cognition. As this study was cross-sectional in its design, future studies could also focus on gathering longitudinal diffusion data and investigating fluctuations in both diffusion and cognitive profiles over time. Furthermore, repeated measurement of clinical symptomatology could determine whether reduced anisotropy is related to increased clinical symptoms, or vice versa, and larger sampling could allow for more robust multivariate analyses, such as structural equational modelling. As above, this study found that positive clinical symptomatology was associated with reduced structural integrity of the anterior region of the CC. This finding is of clinical importance as there is evidence showing that pharmacological intervention improves white matter integrity within the genu of the CC [56]; with other research showing psychological intervention improves frontal white matter tract integrity [89,90]. Consequently, building on the collective findings of this study, future research could investigate whether specific pharmacological or psychological intervention can improve white matter tract integrity for people with schizophrenia and whether that relates to a reduction in clinical symptomatology. This study also incorporated a whole group-based approach for our clinical cohort, which may be considered a limitation. Future research could, therefore, consider a more phenotypic approach to clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging outcomes to further delineate the heterogenous profile associated with schizophrenia. Currently there is no specific, unified, agreed, or comprehensive theoretical or data-driven model of social cognition. As such, these findings outline a specific impairment, without a clear cognitive system to benchmark performance against. Clinicians, researchers, and future work should consider the development of a wholistic cognitive model, which, in turn, would allow for the advancement of more precise and individualized assessment and treatment paradigms for people, both with schizophrenia and without."

            "text": "This study aimed to investigate social cognition and emotion recognition and how outcomes related to the integrity of WM tracts in people with schizophrenia, compared with typical controls. The main findings of this study show that people with schizophrenia have reduced microstructural integrity in the CC, inclusive of its subregions, the genu, body, and splenium. This reduced FA in the CC, specifically the genu, is significantly associated with increased positive clinical symptomatology i.e., hallucinations/delusions, while being negatively associated with reaction times for correctly identifying emotion, specifically happiness. Findings in relation to poorer reaction times to emotion recognition could be due to reduced interhemispheric connectivity secondary to schizophrenia, with symptom severity significantly associated with reduced anisotropy in the genu of the CC. Future research could enhance these findings by investigating left and right hemispheric differences in people with schizophrenia, compared to typical controls. Additionally, future research could assess diffusion of the CC in patients alongside symptom severity over time. Better understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction and the anatomical associations of clinical symptoms may lead to more structured and targeted cognitive and clinical interventions. This, in turn, may ameliorate difficulties associated with schizophrenia and reduce disabling occupational and social burden for people living with the condition.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.B., C.G. and G.D.; methodology, T.B., L.H., D.M., L.C. and G.D.; software, L.H. and L.C.; formal analysis, T.B. and C.G.; resources, G.D.; data curation, L.H., D.M., J.H., L.C. and R.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, T.B., C.G. and G.D.; writing\u2014review and editing, all authors; supervision, T.B, D.P.M., D.W.M., J.P.K., A.P.C., B.P.H., C.M. and G.D.; funding acquisition, G.D.
