The most interesting circumstances are when the overall suspension is unstable (Simha & Ramaswamy 2002), for which perturbations overcome viscous resistance to form large-scale flow patterns (Dombrowski et al. 2004). Unconstrained, this leads to a chaotic swirling flow pattern, whereas confinement in a container organizes the flow. For a sufficiently small round container, the chaotic swirls are replaced by a lone circulating vortex, and all flow ceases if the container is still smaller (Wioland et al. 2013; Lushi, Wioland & Goldstein 2014). Similar low-dissipation global flow patterns arise in other geometries (Opathalage et al. 2019), and become increasingly complex in more complex containers (Hardo\u00fcin et al. 2020). Confinement within an immiscible droplet leads to additional behaviours, coupled with the deformability of the drop shape and its motion within the fluid beyond (Young, Shelley & Stein 2021). Particularly relevant to the present study, the suspension can also drive motion of rigid boundaries, making a Taylor\u2013Couette device into a motor (F\u00fcrthauer et al. 2012) and inducing a negative drag for a sphere moving in a small periodic domain (Foffano et al. 2012).\nThe suspension that we consider is a simple example of this class, constructed of uniformly distributed advected agents that orient only in response to the local strain-rate histories that they experience. Phenomenologically, this is taken to be an alignment of their otherwise uniformly distributed active axes, yielding a net internal fluid stress. Translational and rotational diffusion relax their orientation distribution towards uniform. The basic instabilities of such an active fluid are understood (Ezhilan, Shelley & Saintillan 2013; Marchetti et al. 2013). Unconfined, they are long-wavelength, which loosely explains how they are mediated by the length scales of any geometric confinement. In general, stronger activity can overcome viscous resistance at smaller scales to the point where a seemingly chaotic, turbulence-like flow with a range of length scales develops (Gao et al. 2017; Theillard, Alonso-Matilla & Saintillan 2017).\nMany active suspensions are motivated by biological systems, where a far more complex active microstructure can drive intracellular flow, cell mobility and embryonic development. Here, we consider how this simplest suspension interacts with an inactive rigid object, freely suspended and much larger than the active agents. Investigation focuses on how the object is transported by the suspension within a larger container. The object is anticipated to couple with the suspension in several ways. For a close spacing between it and the container wall, viscous resistance will suppress local instabilities, as would any narrow confinement. However, this aspect of confinement is potentially countered by motion of the object, which will apply a correlated and potentially strong strain rate to the fluid between it and the container wall, which will in turn instigate a coordinated response in the suspension. Several questions are considered regarding the resulting phenomenology. Does it have stable positions or distances from the container wall? Does the active suspension transport it to the container wall or keep it free floating? These questions intersect with past observations regarding how a container of decreasing size first organizes and then suppresses suspension instabilities (Wioland et al. 2013; Lushi et al. 2014). A simple circular object suspended in a circular container is used to identify the basic phenomenology. Such a configuration shares features with, for example, the transport of an organelle within a cell or a colloidal particle in a suspension of motile microbes, but it is designed primarily to simply illuminate mechanisms that are potentially important in any such system. With such a motivation, this configuration builds on multiple studies in fixed (Gao et al. 2017; Hardo\u00fcin et al. 2020) and rotating (F\u00fcrthauer et al. 2012) annular geometries, now with the inner rigid boundary replaced with a zero-inertia free-floating object.\n960 A16-2\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nAfter introducing the simulation model and methods in \u00a7 2, results are considered in three stages. For weak activity in \u00a7 3, the basic circulating flow is a relatively straightforward generalization of cases considered previously. However, there is now also a slow geometric instability that eventually leads to cessation of all suspension activity in the container, leaving the object immobile, arrested near the container wall. In contrast, for strong activity in \u00a7 4, the flow is chaotic and complex. Still, the gross features of the phenomenology of the suspended object and its transport are identifiable and explain why in this case the free-floating object is effectively repelled from the container wall. Section 5 bridges these weak and strong limits. It is only for these intermediate strengths that persistent transport along the container wall or contact with the container might occur.

            "text": "2.1. Active suspension model The model for the active suspension is exactly that of Gao et al. (2017), which itself builds on several earlier developments (Simha & Ramaswamy 2002; Saintillan & Shelley 2008). The active components are uniformly distributed immotile extensor (or contractor) particles. Specifically, we use their coarse-grained model with the Bingham closure that they introduce. For simplicity, we considered only the limit of a diffuse suspension, which represents the basic phenomenology without the added complexity of steric alignment of the active agents and their volume fraction (in their notation, \u03b6 = 0 and \u03b2 = 0). This is sufficient to provide a representative phenomenology for an immersed object. The original discussion of the model is complete (Gao et al. 2017), so we provide only a summary of it. The same model has been used subsequently to study flow in additional geometries (Chen, Gao & Gao 2018) and in liquid drops (Young et al. 2021). This and similar models reproduce key features of active suspension experiments, even without the inclusion of steric alignment (Theillard et al. 2017).\nThe viscous flow equations are augmented with an internal stress \u03b1D:\n\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 (\u2207u + \u2207uT) + \u2207p = \u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1D), (2.1) \u2207 \u00b7 u = 0, (2.2)\nwhere u is the velocity, and p is the pressure that enforces its incompressibility. The coefficient \u03b1 is negative for the case of extensors that we consider. More specifically, \u03b1 is the dipolar strength \u03c3a of the extensors, normalized by a velocity Uo, length , and the Newtonian viscosity of the suspension \u03bc: \u03b1 \u2261 \u03c3a/\u03bcUo 2. For most cases, the immersed object has unit radius so = 1 is appropriate. Alignment of the suspension agents is represented by tensor order parameter D, which is governed by an advection\u2013diffusion equation:\n\u2202D \u2202t + u \u00b7 \u2207D \u2212 (\u2207u \u00b7 D + D \u00b7 \u2207uT) = \u2212 (\u2207u + \u2207uT) .. S + dT \u22072D \u2212 4dR(D \u2212 I/2).\n(2.3) The left-hand side of this equation is the usual upper convective Maxwell advection of a tensor. On the right-hand side, dT \u2261 vDT/bUo is a non-dimensional coefficient of translational diffusion, and dR \u2261 bDR/vUo is a coefficient of rotational diffusion towards isotropy (D = I/2), here written explicitly for two space dimensions. The physical parameters that constitute dT and dR are the particle rotational diffusivity DR, the particle\n960 A16-3\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\ntranslational diffusivity DT , the effective particle volume fraction v, and the particle dimension b. Except when noted, dT = dR = 0.025 in the current simulations. The term involving the rank-four tensor S represents how strain rates orient the active agents, leading to their net active stress. For S, Gao et al. (2017) employed a closure based on the fourth moment of the microscopic distribution function \u03a8 (x, p, t), which underlies the coarse-grained average of the active agent distribution:\n1 = \u222b 2\u03c0\n0 \u03a8 d\u03b8, D(x, t) = \u222b 2\u03c0 0 pp\u03a8 d\u03b8, S(x, t) = \u222b 2\u03c0 0 pppp\u03a8 d\u03b8, (2.4a\u2013c)\nwhere in two space dimensions p = (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8). In solving the combined system, D is evolved per (2.3), and S is closed by assuming a Bingham (1974) distribution: \u03a8 (x, p, t) \u2248 \u03a8B(x, p, t) = A(x, t) exp[B(x, t) .. pp]. Following the basic approach of Chaubal & Leal (1998), also used by Gao et al. (2017), this is solved by taking B to be trace-free and recognizing that it shares principal coordinates with D, indicated here with a p superscript. In two space dimensions, this yields explicit expressions in terms of modified Bessel functions:\nDp11 = A\u03c0 [ I0(B p 11)+ I1(Bp11) ] , (2.5)\nDp22 = A\u03c0 [ I0(B p 11)\u2212 I1(Bp11) ] . (2.6)\nSince D has unit trace, Bp11 (= \u2212Bp22) solves\nI1(B p 11) I0(B p 11)\n= \u2212 \u221a\n1 \u2212 4(D11D22 \u2212 D212), (2.7)\nwhich provides values for the non-zero components of Sp:\nSp1111 = A\u03c0 [ I0(B p 11)+\n2Bp11 \u2212 1 2Bp11 I1(B p 11)\n] , (2.8)\nSp1122 = Sp1212 = Sp1221 = Sp2112 = Sp2121 = Sp2211 = A\u03c0 I1(B\np 11)\n2Bp11 , (2.9)\nSp2222 = A\u03c0 [ I0(B p 11)\u2212\n2Bp11 + 1 2Bp11 I1(B p 11)\n] , (2.10)\nwith\nA = 1 2\u03c0 I0(B p 11) . (2.11)\nRotation of Sp for use in (2.3) is straightforward. The immersed object is assumed to have a no slip surface, which provides a velocity boundary condition\nu(x, t) = U(t)+ \u03a9(t)\u00d7 r, (2.12) with U its translational velocity and \u03a9 = [0, 0,\u03a9]T its angular rotation rate, which is crossed with the vector from its centroid r = [x \u2212 xo, y \u2212 yo, 0]T. For most cases, U and 960 A16-4\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\n\u03a9 are solved in conjunction with the flow equations (2.1) and (2.2) to enforce zero net drag and torque on the surface So of the object:\nF = \u222b\nSo [\u2212pI + (\u2207u + \u2207uT)+ \u03b1D] \u00b7 n dx = 0, (2.13) T =\n\u222b So r \u00d7 ([\u2212pI + (\u2207u + \u2207uT)+ \u03b1D] \u00b7 n) dx = 0. (2.14) To illuminate mechanisms in specific cases, a kinematic constraint v \u00b7 U = 0 replaces part of the F = 0 constraint. In this case, the combined system is instead solved for U\u22a5, such that v \u00b7 U\u22a5 = 0, and F, such that F = Fv represents an external force resisting motion in the direction of unit vector v. Some cases also simply fix the object in place with U = \u03a9 = 0. The fixed boundary Sc of the container is also no-slip, so u = 0 on x \u2208 Sc. It is assumed that boundaries do not orient the active agents, so n \u00b7 \u2207D = 0 on x \u2208 (So \u222a Sc).\n2.2. Numerical methods The momentum balance (2.1) and incompressibility constraint (2.2) are discretized with Lagrange polynomial quadrilateral finite elements of degree n for the velocity u, and degree n \u2212 1 for the pressure p. Similarly, D in (2.3) is discretized with degree-m polynomials. The translational advection term u \u00b7 \u2207D in (2.3) is incorporated into the time derivative by moving the mesh at the fluid velocity. Specifically, this is done by advecting the degree-m polynomial function that maps the finite-element mesh x(X , t) to a fixed reference mesh X with the local velocity starting from time tr when they coincide:\ndx(X , t) dt = u(x, t) for t \u2265 tr, and x(X , tr) = X . (2.15)\nThe distortional tensor advection terms (\u2207u \u00b7 D + D \u00b7 \u2207uT), the S alignment term, and the dR rotational relaxation terms are evaluated on the distorted x mesh and time integrated with a second-order backward differencing scheme. The dT spatial diffusion term is time integrated with a first-order forward difference, which yields an implicit system that is solved in conjunction with the mass-matrix inversion.\nOverall, this moving mesh approach is selected primarily to accommodate the motion of the immersed object. Since the mesh distorts significantly in time, the reference X mesh is reconstructed periodically for the current location of the object. The solution at the current and recent time steps is then projected to the new mesh using the same degree-m weak-form discretization. This is done every Nr = 10 time steps, which also sets a new tr in (2.15). To impose dynamic constraints, such as (2.13) and (2.14), or the similar v \u00b7 U = 0 kinematic constraint, the linearity of (2.1) and (2.2) is used to solve for the U and \u03a9 that enforce the boundary condition (2.12). The scheme was implemented with the deal.II finite-element libraries (Arndt et al. 2022).\nFor most simulations, m = n = 3, and the total number of degrees of freedom for u, p and D ranged from 1460 for the weakest activity case (\u03b1 = \u22120.6) to 13 840 for the most active case (\u03b1 = \u221280). Time steps and simulation times varied significantly based on the stability restrictions, resolution and phenomenology of the different cases; some simulations were run for over 106 time steps to accumulate statistics. Most cases were run with multiple resolutions and time steps to confirm discretization independence.\n960 A16-5\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\n2.3. Flow configuration Figure 1(a) shows the configuration. The immersed object is a circle of radius a = 1 (in most cases) in a larger circular container of radius R = 2. Except when noted, the circle is initialized concentric with the container, with xo(0) = (0, 0). Figure 1(b) shows an example distorted mesh just prior to projection onto a new one. Reference X meshes are constructed in a straightforward way from circles and straight lines between the two boundaries. The suspension is assumed to be initially isotropic: D(x, 0) = I/2. Animated visualizations of the flows are shown in supplementary movies 1\u201310 for \u03b1 = \u22120.625, \u22121, \u22122.5, \u22125.0, \u221210, \u221220, \u221240 (for a = 0.5, a = 1.0 and a = 1.5), and \u221280, respectively.\nWhen \u03b1 is such that the fluid is unstable for the given geometry, the flow evolves rapidly from any small perturbation. None of the results were found to be sensitive to the perturbation details, aside from setting the rotation direction in cases for which the flow is so regular that the rotation direction does not change. The \u03b1 stability limit for R = 2 with dT = dR = 0.05 without the free-floating object was found to be \u03b1c \u2248 \u22120.63, matching previous simulations and stability analysis (Woodhouse & Goldstein 2012; Gao et al. 2017). In a corresponding fixed-boundary annulus container (xo = (0, 0), a = 1 and R = 2, with U = 0 and \u03a9 = 0), \u03b1 = \u22121.23 was unstable to a circulating flow, while \u03b1 = \u22121.22 was stable, matching the simulations and analysis of Chen et al. (2018). The transitions with \u03b1 to propagating wave solutions and chaotic flow for the annular case also match.\n3. Weak activity (\u22121 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0) 3.1. Suspension instability\nAlthough the initial geometry with |xo| = ro = 0 matches the annulus of Chen et al. (2018), the mobility of the inner circle is expected to facilitate instability for weaker activity than their fixed-wall limit \u03b1c \u2248 \u22121.23. In the fixed-wall case, an axisymmetric circulating flow is observed for small unstable |\u03b1|, so the circular Couette-like flow in figure 2 is as expected, and is observed for \u03b1 \u22120.6. The t = 1500 time shown is after 960 A16-6\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nthe activity of the suspension instability has plateaued but before the geometric instability considered in the next subsection becomes pronounced. At this time, the circular object and container are still nearly concentric with ro = 0.001, having started at ro = 0. The circle rotates at |\u03a9| = 0.017, with the sign of \u03a9 depending on the specifics of the initial perturbation. Of course, this rate is faster for larger |\u03b1|: |\u03a9| = 0.026 for \u03b1 = \u22120.625, |\u03a9| = 0.052 for \u03b1 = \u22120.75, and |\u03a9| = 0.087 for \u03b1 = \u22121. Perturbations decay for \u03b1 \u2265 \u22120.575. Decreasing the rotational mobility of the circle by adding a resistance torque Tr = \u2212c\u03c4\u03a9 increases the |\u03b1| suspension stability threshold. For \u03b1 = \u22121.0, c\u03c4 = 8.5 is stable, whereas c\u03c4 = 8.0 only slows rotation to |\u03a9| = 0.043.\n3.2. Geometric instability The rotating axisymmetric low-|\u03b1| case visualized in figure 2 is not itself stable, although the subsequent geometric instability develops much more slowly than that of the suspension itself. Figure 3 shows the long-time evolution for the \u03b1 = \u22121 case. The nearly axisymmetric flow is established with its peak |\u03a9| by t \u2248 300, but the circle then migrates from ro \u2248 0 to ro \u2248 0.986 (\u03b4 = 0.014 from contact) for t 5000, as seen in figure 3(a). Any small perturbation leads to the same expanding spiral seen in figure 3(b). The rate of migration and precession is first slow, then more rapid, before it slows again near the container wall. The migration, and indeed all flow, stops for t > 5000, when the wall separation distance is \u03b4 = 0.014. Details of the approach to the container wall and the cessation of flow are discussed in \u00a7 3.3, after the mechanism of the migration is considered here.\nFigures 4(a\u2013f ) show how a small displacement from symmetric leads to higher strain rates in the fluid in the now narrower region between the object and the closer container wall, which in turn strengthens D, both its wall normal Dnn and tangential Dnt components.\n960 A16-7\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\n960 A16-8\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nAs in a planar Couette configuration, there is an active shear stress component, which is sympathetic with the shear strain rate, and a tensile normal stress (Saintillan 2018). The stronger Dnt stress in the narrow side versus the wide side drives the precession, while the corresponding imbalanced Dnn across the object pulls it towards the nearer container wall. Together, these yield the spiral pattern of figure 3(b). The mismatched Dnt also drives a rotation of the circle that is counter to a rolling motion, which in conjunction with the precession also increases the strain rate in the narrow side relative to the wider side. Exponential growth of the displacement persists until t \u2248 1700 when ro \u2248 0.25R (figure 3a), which corresponds approximately to the point at which the streamlines in the frame of the precessing circle show a distinct recirculation in the larger space (figure 4c). In the final frame, figure 4( f ), where ro = 0.985 (\u03b4 = 0.015), the flow is nearly stopped. All flow stops at \u03b4 = 0.014.\n3.3. Near-wall behaviour As it approaches, the object\u2019s motion towards the container wall is increasingly opposed by the usual large normal lubrication resistance. However, active shear stress in the narrowing gap continues to cause counter-rolling rotation and continued precession along the container wall. The deviatoric components of \u03b1D on the surfaces in this narrow lubrication-like gap are plotted in figure 5, rotated into local surface coordinates. In the narrowest region, the wall-normal components are nearly the same across the gap, consistent with the lubrication limit. They hold the object near the wall, and for \u03b1 = \u22121 slowly pull it closer. When a \u03b4c = 0.05 standoff constraint is imposed, they hold it against this constraint as it precesses. Upstream and downstream of the narrowest gap, symmetry is broken, with wall-normal stresses there significantly different. By \u03b3 = \u00b1\u03c0/4, they are compressive behind the object and tensile ahead of it, promoting the precession and thus further increasing shear strain rate in the smallest gap.\nOne notable feature of figure 5 is that the active shear stresses are most significant in the lubrication layer near the wall of the container, activated there by the relatively high local strain rate. Two-thirds (65.6 %) of the net active-stress torque on the cylinder is on the lowest quarter of the circle (|\u03b3 | \u2264 \u03c0/4), and 89 % is on its lower half (|\u03b3 | < \u03c0/2). Yet for such weak activity, even in these same regions, the flow remains nearly identical to a constant viscosity Newtonian fluid driven by the motion of the circle. In the frame that\n960 A16-9\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nfixes the precession angle, the streamfunction \u03c8 flow pattern (with u = [\u03c8y,\u2212\u03c8x]T) is compared with the exact Stokes flow solution (Wannier 1950) in figure 6(a). There is only a slight difference in the velocity profile in the region of highest strain rate (figure 6c), and almost no difference at |\u03b3 | = \u00b1\u03c0/2 (figure 6b). This can be anticipated: the flow is nearly Stokesian for low activity (|\u03b1| \u2192 0), though the viscosity might still depend on \u03b1 (or, similarly, suspension concentration), as has been observed in suspensions (L\u00f3pez et al. 2015). In addition, the mobility of the circle is required to (barely) maintain the flow, and the minimum dissipation flow must be a Stokes flow. However, the activity, viewed as components of D, is not nearly so symmetric as the velocity field. (The margination process itself also obviously breaks the symmetry of a Stokes flow, although that is slower still than the velocities associated with precession and rotation.)\nDespite the flow pattern nearly matching that of a Newtonian fluid, applying lubrication theory is hindered by a lack of specificity in boundary conditions at either end of the nominal gap. For example, figure 5 shows that Dnt changes continuously and significantly over at least \u2212\u03c0/2 < \u03b3 < \u03c0/2, well beyond where the lubrication limit can be expected to be accurate. However, the overall behaviour does suggest that lubrication theory might afford a more useful description for still smaller gaps or other geometries with more extensive narrow regions than this circle-in-circle configuration. Of course, if contact is truly close, then the very character of the suspension must also be\n960 A16-10\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nquestioned, which is revisited in \u00a7 6. For these reasons, we defer any further analysis of contact.\nFor the small |\u03b1| cases considered thus far, immobilizing the object at any ro stabilizes the suspension, which confirms that the entire flow is linked intimately to the mobility of the object. We can estimate the viscous resistance that the object must overcome to remain rotating (and hence slowly marginating) based on the Newtonian fluid limit. The required torque to maintain rotation without suspension activity (\u03b1 = 0) increases rapidly near the point of contact. Assuming that the angular precession rate equals the angular rotation rate of the object, it increases by only a factor 1.14 from ro = 0 to 0.8, but doubles by ro = 0.956, and quadruples by ro = 0.990. It follows that weaker activity, or other external resistance on the object, should lead to arrest at smaller ro. For \u03b1 = \u22120.75, the flow indeed ceases at ro = 0.949 (\u03b4 = 0.051), rather than the value ro = 0.986 (\u03b4 = 0.014) for \u03b1 = \u22121. For \u03b1 = \u22120.625, which is near the limit of any fluid instability for this configuration, it stops at ro = 0.80, after following a similar spiral trajectory (figure 7). In this case, the migration rate is smaller relative to the precession rate, leading to a more tightly spaced spiral than for \u03b1 = \u22121 (figure 3). When a rotational resistance torque Tr = \u22128\u03a9 is added for \u03b1 = \u22121, as discussed in \u00a7 3.1, the additional dissipation arrests the circle further from the container wall at \u03b4 = 0.020.\nThe dependence of suspension instability on the mobility of the object introduces the question of what changes for activity that is self-sustaining independently of the mobility of the circle. This is the case for \u03b1 \u2264 \u221210 in the next section."

Figure 9 quantifies this along with the rotation rate of the circle with joint probability distributions. For \u03b1 = \u221210, it is most likely rotating slowly and at a relatively large ro \u2248 0.7 (ro = 1 would be contact).

Figures 9(d,e, f ) compare the ro\u2013\u03a9 joint probability distributions for \u03b1 = \u221240 and a = 0.5, 1 and 1.5. The small a = 0.5 circle is the closest to following a simple random-walk-like process, though only in some regions. For ro 0.8, it has a broad flat distribution in\u03a9 and an approximately linear increase with ro, as would be commensurate with a random sampling in this geometry. However, this simple trend ends for ro 0.8, still well away from the ro = 1.5 radius of contact. For radius a = 1, non-zero rotation is the most likely, and the object rarely leaves the ro < 0.6 region of the container. The a = 1.5 case is the most striking. The circle nearly always rotates, though slowly relative to the other cases. Its changes of direction, which are not uncommon, are\n960 A16-13\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nsudden, contributing little to the\u03a9 \u2248 0 portion of the distributions. Even this larger circle never approaches close to the container walls, rarely reaching beyond ro = 0.2, which leaves a \u03b4 = 0.3 gap before contact.\nThe mechanism that counters contact is visualized in figure 10 for a particularly close approach and subsequent repulsion for \u03b1 = \u221220. The sequence starts in a period of fast rotation and correlated flow around the circumference of the circle. The overall flow at this time loosely resembles the uniform circulation flow of the \u03b1 = \u22120.6 case in figure 2, though with additional waviness reflecting its additional instabilities. In this state, the circle is pulled towards the container wall by shear-driven tensile normal stress, following the same basic margination mechanism of the geometric instability for weak activity discussed in \u00a7 3.2. However, as it approaches, there is a sharp decrease in this circle\u2019s rotation. The overall circulation fails rapidly as the gap narrows, and the strain rate in the gap drops similarly. The circulating flow is replaced by distinct vortices in the larger region, which resemble those associated with the travelling-wave instability observed in a fixed-wall annular geometry (Chen et al. 2018). No flow structures appear in the smaller gap. Both the viscous resistance of this configuration and de-correlation of the azimuthal flow structure lead to slower rotation of the circle; compared to the approach phase, its rotation essentially ceases. Without sustaining shear strain, the net active stresses decay in the narrow region, as seen in figures 10(c\u2013g). In this same period, the array of vortex-like structures strengthens and fills the wider gap. For each oppositely rotating vortex, the active shear component Dnt on the circle changes sign, so they do not apply a significant net torque. In contrast, the normal stress component Dnn for all of them acts in the same tensile sense to draw the circle away from the container wall, which happens rapidly. All close approaches observed for all \u03b1 \u2264 \u221210 cases showed a similar evolution.\nTo illustrate the lift forces more explicitly, figure 11(a) visualizes a corresponding case with the circle held fixed (U = 0 and \u03a9 = 0) at ro = 0.75. Unlike the small \u03b1 cases, the suspension activity does not depend on the motion of the object to sustain it, and a vigorous flow persists in the larger space. The alternating vortex structures are distinct, and there is only weak flow in the narrow gap. Active stresses on the circle (figure 11b) reflect the alternating vortex structure, leading to a significant normal stress generally pulling the circle away from the container wall. The corresponding shear stresses alternate sign with near-zero mean.\n960 A16-14\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nThe \u03b1 = \u221220 case was selected for the above examination because the structures can be more clearly identified than for stronger activity levels. However, the same behaviour is observed for \u03b1 = \u221280. Figure 12 visualizes the evolution of the flow structure in both cases for longer periods. The \u03b1 = \u221280 case (figure 12b) shows more random and smaller structures than \u03b1 = \u221220 (figure 12a), but both also show periods of relatively correlated circulating flow and periods with relatively distinct arrays of vortices of alternating sense. For \u03b1 = \u221280, these arrays are less distinct, due to smaller-scale instabilities available for this \u03b1. For both cases, rotation of the circle remains primarily in a single direction for periods. Still, even for \u03b1 \u2264 \u221210, there are many reversals of rotation direction. It should be noted that the time periods visualized in figures 8, 10 and 12 are a small fraction of the total times simulated and analysed.\n960 A16-15\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss"

            "heading": "5. Transition behaviour (\u22125 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u22121)",
            "text": "In \u00a7 3, where mobility of the object was essential for instability of the suspension, it was moved towards the container wall until viscous resistance limited its mobility to a degree that the suspension stabilized and flow ceased. In contrast, in \u00a7 4, the suspension remained active, even if the object was held fixed. When the object approached the container wall, organized activity in the gap was significantly suppressed, and the persistent activity in the bulk drew it away from the container wall. The transition between these behaviours is complex.\nIn some cases, the standoff distance is nearly constant. For example, for \u03b1 = \u22125, it remains about \u03b4 \u2248 0.045 above the wall, with root mean square (r.m.s.) fluctuations of only \u03c3s = 0.005, though its rotation rate fluctuates as it interacts with the unsteady vortical structures that persist in the flow (as will be seen in figure 14a). This stability was seen in figure 9(a): the radial position is stable, and it never changes its sense of rotation or precession. This reflects a balance between the sustained activity in the high-strain-rate narrow gap, also a feature of the weaker activity cases of \u00a7 3, and the tensile normal stresses of the persistent structures in the wider region that counter close approaches to the container wall in \u00a7 4. However, for somewhat weaker activity, such as \u03b1 = \u22122.5, the object seems to approach indefinitely towards contact, though increasingly slowly due to increasing lubrication resistance. To study this dynamics in an analogous statistically stationary flow that avoids the discretization challenges and physical complexity of actual contact, we constrain the circle to maintain a constant distance \u03b4c from the wall. The corresponding Lagrange multiplier force is interpretable as countering the net hydrodynamic lift force L, which is negative towards and positive away from the adjacent container wall. In corresponding unconstrained free-flowing precessing cases, fluctuating forces cause variations in \u03b4, but motion normal to the wall is so strongly resisted by lubrication effects that the corresponding changes in \u03b4 are slow, allowing at most small \u03b4 fluctuation.\nThe lift L is plotted in figure 13 for wall-distance constraints \u03b4c = 0.10, 0.04 and 0.03 for \u03b1 \u2208 [\u22125, 0]. All these \u03b4c show a cessation of motion, zero lift, and indeed absence of flow for small enough |\u03b1|, consistent with the \u03b4 and \u03b1 values needed for sustained activity in \u00a7 3. For stronger |\u03b1| and smaller \u03b4c, the lift switches from attraction (L < 0) to repulsion (L > 0). This is consistent with the observed persistent precession for \u03b1 = \u22125. The lift L is steady for smaller |\u03b1|, but this changes in two ways when |\u03b1| increases. A high-frequency instability appears, seemingly independently of \u03b4c, for \u03b1 \u22122.5. This corresponds to the travelling-wave instability observed in the corresponding fixed-wall annular geometry and analysed in a planar configuration (Gao et al. 2017). The near independence of \u03b4c is anticipated because it is expected to depend primarily on the vortices in the larger space, which barely change here for the range of \u03b4c considered. In all cases, the high-frequency component amplitude increases with stronger activity.\nFor the fixed U = 0, \u03a9 = 0, \u03b4c = 0.04 case, also shown in figure 13, L fluctuations also appear as \u03b1 \u22122.5, although their amplitude is smaller. For \u03b1 = \u22125, L = 8.9 \u00b1 0.1 (mean \u00b1 r.m.s.). The biggest difference, however, for this fixed case is that without significant shear strain between the fixed object and the container wall, there is no induced active stress attraction. Only the self-sustaining flow above the object is active, and it induces positive lift.\nIn some cases, there is also a distinct low frequency, with time scale comparable to the inverse precession rate. When the circle is further from the wall, this longer-period behaviour appears for smaller |\u03b1|. For \u03b4c = 0.10, it is distinct for \u03b1 \u22121.75, as shown in the inset of figure 13, which is before the onset of the high-frequency instability.\n960 A16-16\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nHowever, it appears, apparently suddenly, only for \u03b1 \u22123.35 for \u03b4c = 0.04, and \u03b1 \u22124.60 for \u03b4c = 0.03. Under some conditions, it is of higher amplitude than the travelling-wave instability, and always much lower frequency. It is never observed if the circle is held fixed with U = 0 and \u03a9 = 0. Its mechanism is straightforward to explain, but the complexity of the overall configuration hampers a full quantitative description. Recall that the circle rotates with a sense opposite to what it would be were it rolling along the container wall. It thus pumps fluid ahead of it through the narrow gap between it and the wall, which in turn drives an additional slow circulation of fluid in the container, so the overall circulating flow rate modestly exceeds that of the precession rate of the circle. When this is strong enough, it advects the basic travelling-wave instability structures faster than the precession rate. This does not happen for weaker activity, when the structures exist typically as a counter-rotating pair filling in the largest region of fluid. It also is suppressed for smaller \u03b4c cases because there is less of this circulation flow driven by the smaller gap spacing, which is insufficient to overcome the preferred arrangement of the vortex array. This is consistent with there also being no low-frequency component in the fully fixed case.\nFigure 14 shows the space\u2013time behaviour of the flow leading to the observed lift and motion for several of the specific cases. Figures 14(a,b) show the strong similarity between the unconstrained \u03b4 evolution (figure 14a) versus contained motion at a similar \u03b4 = \u03b4c (figure 14b) for \u03b1 = \u22125. Both show both the high- and low-frequency components. The travelling-wave instability manifests as a high-frequency, spatially correlated perturbation. It is associated with a synchronized change in the shape of the vortex structures; although each vortex remains distinct, their amplitudes and aspect ratios both change at this higher frequency. The low frequency arises from the slow advection of these structures at a speed modestly faster than the precession. For \u03b1 = \u22122 and \u03b4c = 0.10 in figure 14(c), the structures themselves do not fluctuate rapidly, so no high-frequency component is evident, although the low-frequency component is pronounced. Their slow advection is similar to\n960 A16-17\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nthe low-frequency component in the \u03b1 = \u22125 cases in figures 14(a,b). In all these cases, new small vortices form ahead of the precessing circle, grow as they advect slightly faster than the circle, and eventually weaken and disappear as they catch up to its trailing side.\nFor the unconstrained \u03b1 = \u22122.5 case, the circle precesses close to the container wall, with only two prominent and steady counter-rotating lift-promoting vortices filling the\n960 A16-18\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\ncontainer opposite it (figure 14d). No instability or unsteadiness is apparent in this case, though this structure resembles those that do become unstable with a long period for either larger |\u03b1| or larger \u03b4c. For small \u03b4c, increasing |\u03b1| shows the similar high-frequency instability seen in other cases, though for \u03b1 = \u22124 and \u03b4c = 0.03, the fluctuating vortices themselves still precess in lockstep with the circle (figure 14e), so there is no low frequency in this case."

            "text": "For weak activity, mobility of the object decreases the stability of the suspension relative to the corresponding fixed geometry, resulting in a lower threshold for sustained flow. These cases also all transport the object towards a nearby wall, with active shearing stress in the space between it and the wall maintained by the shear strain rate due to its counter-rolling motion along the wall. Attraction towards the wall is due to the concomitant tensile normal component produced in the gap. As the object approaches, viscous resistance decreases its rotational mobility, which for sufficiently weak activity stabilizes the entire system, leaving the object in a fixed location near the wall. The wall distance of arrest is larger for weaker activity. Though only a circle-in-circle configuration was considered here, this potential self-induced cessation of instability is anticipated to be a feature of many such systems: if suspension instability depends on the mobility of the object, then it will be stabilized if the object is transported to a region where its mobility is sufficiently low. It is noteworthy that this directed and self-terminating transport arises without chemoattractants or similar complex mechanisms that might direct motion in biological systems.\nIn contrast, when the activity is strong, the mobility of the object is not essential for the instability of the suspension. In this case, the object is advected chaotically, although not following any simple random-walk-like statistical distribution, and it never reaches the container walls. The lift force preventing contact derives from the greater activity in the active bulk fluid region versus the relatively suppressed activity in the fluid that is temporarily confined between the object and the wall. This mechanism is observed to be robust: the object remained well off the wall even in long simulations for a range of activity strengths. Similarly, objects initialized near the wall were quickly lifted away from it (not shown), and objects held fixed near the wall experienced a lift force away from it.\nFor modest activity strengths, lift force fluctuations were associated with wave-like instabilities, as observed in similar fixed geometries, and with precession along the wall. For greater activity, these create net lift, but for weaker activity, they do not overcome the gap-driven attraction towards the wall. In essence, when activity is concentrated close to the wall under the object, enhanced there by the high strain rate in that region, it draws the object closer to the wall. In contrast, modestly stronger |\u03b1| supports more bulk region active flow, independently of the object, and draws it further from the wall. Net lift decreases and changes sign with increased distance from the wall, which leads in some cases to nearly constant standoff distances, for which motion along the wall is indefinitely persistent in a single direction. For still weaker but sufficient activity to maintain flow in absence of object mobility, the net result is a persistent wallward force, countered only by the usual wall-normal lubrication resistance and which can be anticipated to eventually lead to contact.\nCollectively, these behaviours suggest scenarios where modulations of the overall activity of the suspension could lead to sequences of the events that could achieve useful transport objectives. For example, a brief period of high activity (e.g. \u03b1 \u221210) will pick up an object from a wall. Following that, modest activity (e.g. \u22125 < \u03b1 < \u22122) could then transport it some distance in a deterministic way, following the contour of a container wall,\n960 A16-19\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n19 1\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nas for the \u03b1 = \u22125 case. Two scenarios could then deliver the object to another location. In the simpler case, |\u03b1| would diminish to stabilize the suspension so all motion stops. More interestingly, the object could also autonomically arrest at a point where it encounters a region of confinement that sufficiently diminishes its hydrodynamic mobility.\nThere are many caveats to keep in mind with such a simple model. In our particular case, we recognize that a small enough spacing between the object will violate the coarse-graining approach of the suspension model used. For example, steric interaction might cause additional repulsive forces, or alignment might be forced directly by the geometry. Similarly, three-dimensional effects will surely alter the details of any such flow, though the mechanisms discussed here are anticipated to be robust to dimensionality.
