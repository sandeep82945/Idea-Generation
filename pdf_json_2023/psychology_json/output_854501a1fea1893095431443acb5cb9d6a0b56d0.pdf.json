    "abstractText": "The poor cycle stability caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides which have been key scientific issue in the development of high-efficiency lithium\u2013sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries. In this work, the authors report a Fe-doped Co3O4 (named FCO) that was used as a sulfur-loaded host material for Li\u2013S batteries. We demonstrate the important roles of well-designed Co3O4 particles and Fe atoms in regulating polysulfide conversion due to the strong adsorption of polysulfides by polar Co3O4, whereas Fe atoms and Co3O4 catalyze polysulfide conversion. Therefore, the LiS batteries with FCO-180 (When the hydrothermal temperature is 180 \u25e6C) sea urchinlike composites exhibited a high superior energy density (992.7 mAh g\u22121 at 0.2 C, after 100 cycles) and long-term cyclability (649.4 mAh g\u22121 at 1 C, 300 cycles) with high sulfur loading (75 wt%). This work confirms that the FCO-180 sea urchinlike increases not only the capacity of high-rate but also a generic and feasible strategy to construct practical Li\u2013S batteries for emerging energy-storage applications.",

            "text": "For largescale energy storage applications, such as new energy vehicles and energy storage systems, lithium\u2013sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries have been attractive due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density (2600 Wh kg\u22121) [1]. In addition, the elemental sulfur delivers a high theoretical capacity (1675 mAh g\u22121) based on the redox reaction, which is 3\u20135 folds higher than those for state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries [2]. Meanwhile, sulfur, the main cathode material in Li\u2013S batteries, is cheap and, with low toxicity, naturally abundant [3]. However, the commercialization of Li\u2013S batteries has been impeded due to a series of challenges, for example, the low electronic conductivity of sulfur [4], the dissolution of high-order Lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) (Li2Sn, 4 \u2264 n \u2264 8) into the electrolyte and the shuttling of these dissolved species between the cathode and anode [5], the large volumetric expansion (\u224880%) upon the conversion of S to Li2S [6]. These issues inevitably bring about reduced active sulfur utilization, low coulombic efficiency, unsatisfactory capacity, and poor rate performance for Li\u2013S batteries [7]. Over the past decade, efforts have been made to design novel cathode materials to deal with these problems [8]. Among them, the excellent design of cathode materials is urgently needed for immobilizing LiPSs and enhancing the electrical conductivity of the cathode. Embedding sulfur into conductive carbon-based materials [9], such as carbon nanofibers [10], porous hollow carbons [11], and graphene [12], has been employed as a popular strategy. Although physical adsorption occurs between carbonaceous materials and LiPSs, the interaction between nonpolar carbon-based and LiPSs intermediate is weak [13].\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1612. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13101612 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1612 2 of 12\nTherefore, it is necessary to introduce polar materials into the sulfur electrode to fix the soluble LiPSs on the cathode side [14]. Transition metal oxides (TMOs, such as Fe2O3, MnO2, and Co3O4) [15\u201317] were observed to have stronger chemical bonding and catalytic effect towards LiPSs. Among them, Zhong et al. [18] found that a large amount of Li\u2013O bounding on cobalt oxideadsorbed LiPSs. Meanwhile, strong metal-sulfur binding was observed when adsorbing LiPSs on Co3O4, and the cyclability of the battery was greatly improved. Although the effective chemical adsorption of LiPSs, the low conductivity of such metal oxide material limits their application in high-performance Li\u2013S batteries [19]. In view of this, metal materials with catalytic conversion effects have been combined with oxides to construct bifunctional compounds to improve the conversion rate of LiPSs [20]. In the work of Zhang et al. [21], they demonstrated that highly conductive Fe, Fe3C, and graphitic heteroatoms-doped carbon with approved electron/ion conductivity mitigated LiPS migration and regulated Li2S deposition/decomposition. Therefore, in order to achieve the high performance of Li\u2013S batteries, researchers have proposed the development of a composite polar additive for sulfur cathodes [22\u201324]. Inspired by this, we present prepared sea urchinlike Co3O4 with iron (Fe) doping via facile hydrothermal and heat treatment methods. As the Fe\u2013decorated sea urchinlike materials evidently improved electron conductivity. Benefiting from polar Fe and Co3O4, which provide strong chemical adsorption on LiPSs. The sea urchinlike structure and Fe atoms with large specific surface area provide enough reaction sites for electrochemical reaction, delivering the discharge capacity was 774.9 mAh g\u22121 when the cells tested the rate capability at 2 C. This unique sea urchinlike Fe/C3O4 cathode offered stable discharge capacity over 300 cycles at 1 C with a coulombic efficiency close to 100%, opening up a new thought to obtain an excellent sulfur host in high-performance Li\u2013S batteries."

Observing from SEM images (Figure 2a,b and Figure S1), the sea urchinlike structure was well maintained only for FCO-180. FCO-180 presents regular sphericity with a uniform diameter of 5\u201313 \u00b5m. This morphology was also detected from the TEM (Figure 2c). Moreover, the shape of the FCO-180 sample is sea urchinlike, which could provide more of the specific surface area. In Figure 2d, each Fe atom has a size of about 20\u201330 nm, and Fe atoms are dispersed homogeneously in Co3O4. As shown in Figure 2e,f (the high-resolution (HR)TEM), there are two evident crystal lattice fringe distances indexed to the (311) and (111) plane of Co3O4, respectively. The EDS mapping of FCO-180 spheres further confirmed the uniform distribution of O, Co, and Fe (Figure 2g\u2013j) in the formed sea urchinlike structure.

In Figure 3a, there are Xray diffraction (XRD) patterns of FCO-160, FCO-180, and FCO-200. The FCO-180 exhibits diffraction peaks at 18.9, 31.4, 36.6, and 65.28\u25e6 that can be ascribed to the (111), (220), (311), and (440) planes of Co3O4 (PDF#431003). Moreover, the signals of iron nanoparticles and their oxides were not observed in the diffraction peaks of FCO-160, FCO-180, and FCO-200, further indicating that the highly dispersed Fe atoms were successfully doped within Co3O4. Additionally, XRD data around the main FCO peak at around 36.6\u25e6 were enlarged in Figure S2. It is interesting that the XRD diffraction peaks around 36.6\u25e6 are shifted to small angles with increasing annealing temperature. The reason for this phenomenon may be due to the increase in temperature, which leads to the increase of lattice oxygen defects within the oxide system, thus causing lattice distortion. As seen in Figure 3b, the thermogravimetric curve reveals that the S content in the S@FCO-180 sea urchinlike is about 75 wt%. The higher sulfur content in the S@FCO-180 than that of S@FCO-160 and S@FCO-200, would promise a practical application for sulfur cathode material and prove the sulfur loading ability of the FCO-180 sea urchinlike structure. As shown in Figures 3c,d and S3, the N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms were applied to study the specific surface area and pore structure of FCO-180, together with FCO160 and FCO-200 for comparison. In Figure 3c, the FCO-160, FCO-180, and FCO-200 samples show typical type-III nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms with a clear H3 hysteresis loop, indicating the presence of mesopores.

The S@FCO-180 el ctrode showed well-defined cha ge/discharge plate us at 0.2 C c rresponding t th ab vementio ed CV profiles (Figure 5b). For comparison, the corresponding electrochemical measurement of S@FCO-160 and S@FCO-200 cathodes were presented in Figure S4c,d. The discharge capacity of the S@FCO-180 electrode was 1220.4 mAh g\u22121, which was higher than the S@FCO-160 and S@FCO-200 electrodes. The decay rate of the discharge capacity of the S@FCO-180 electrode from the 1st to the 100th cycle is lower than that of the S@FCO-160 and S@FCO-200 electrodes. Figure 3c reveals the cycling performance of cells with S@FCO-160, S@FCO-180, and S@FCO-200 electrodes at 0.2 C for 100 cycles. The specific capacity reached 992.8 mAh g\u22121 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, which was about 81.4% of the initial capacity. The excellent cycling properties and the high coulombic efficiency of the S@FCO-180 cathode can be attributed to the sea urchinlike and enhanced electrical conductivity by the doping of Fe atoms. Rate capability tests for S@FCO-160, S@FCO-180, and S@FCO-200 electrodes were conducted, as shown in Figure 5d. Among the three, S@FCO-180 showed higher capacity values. The discharged capacities of the S@FCO-180 cathode were 1498.0, 1222.2, 1020.4, 890.1, and 774.9 mAh g\u22121, which maintained at the increased current densities of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 C, respectively. When the current density was increased to 2 C, the discharge capacity still maintained up to 774.9 mA h g\u22121, showing about 51.7% of the first capacity.

Even when the current density was switched back to 0.1 C, the discharge capacity of the S@FCO-180 cell recovered to 1022.1 mAh g\u22121. The dramatic capacity decline of the S@FCO160 and S@FCO-200 cathode can be attributed to the severe shuttle effect.

As illustrated in Figure 5f, the S@FCO-180 el ctrode showed a low resistance of 54 \u2126, whereas a higher resistance of 58 \u2126 and 90 \u2126 was found in the S@FCO-160 and S@FCO-200 electrodes before cycling. The Nyquist plot displayed a semicircle followed by a straight line corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and Warburg resistance (ZW), respectively. As shown in Figure 5f, among three curves, the S@FCO-180 electrode showed a smaller charge transfer resistance and a faster charge transfer between S@FCO-180 and LiPSs. The Rct significantly decreased for the S@FCO-180 electrode as compared to S@FCO-160 and S@FCO-200 electrodes, which might be mainly because of the introduction of more Fe/Co3O4 nanoparticles into the sea urchinlike structur . The Fe/Co3O4 nanoparticles and sea urchinlike structure can offer more sufficient pathways for electrons to reach FCO-180/LiPSs interface and bring more active sites inside the reaction interface. Then Figure 5g displayed the long-cycle performance of LiS batteries, which were tested at 1 C after activating at 0.1 C for two cycles. The initial discharge capacity of the cell with S@FCO-180 was about 867.0 mA h g\u22121. In addition, the average capacity fading rate was as low as 0.085% per cycle for 300 cycles, much better than the cells with\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1612 8 of 12\nother electrodes, including S@FCO-160 and S@FCO-200 electrodes. The excellent results of S@FCO-180 proved that complete encapsulation of sulfur inside Fe/Co3O4 sea urchinlike is an effective way of achieving high cycle stability. To further explore the diffusion process of lithium ions, cyclic voltammetry is devoted to investigating the conversion kinetics of the LiPSs in the LiS batteries. The diffusion characteristics of Li+ of FCO-160, FCO-180, and FCO-200 electrodes were investigated by CV analysis at scan rates ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mV S\u22121 in Figure 6. All LiS cells presented two well-separated reduction peaks, which corresponded to the reduction of elemental S to Li2S via intermediate LiPSs. In addition, the peak positions showed a slight shift with the scan rate increasing. Additionally, the oxidation peak was related to the reverse process, that is, the oxidation of Li2S/Li2S2 to Li2Sx (4 < x < 8) until Li2Sx (4 < x < 8) was completely oxidized to elemental sulfur, thus completing the redox cycle. The lithium-ion diffusion properties were obtained by using the Randles\u2013Sevcik equation:\nIp = (2.69 \u00d7 105) n1.5 ADLi+0.5 + \u2206CLi+ + \u03bd0.5 Nanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 12\nThe visualized adsorption ability test of LiPSs and UVvis spectroscopy was con-\nducted to further probe the chemical interaction between different cathode materials\n(S@FCO-160, S@FCO-180, and S@FCO-200) and LiPSs, using Li2S6 as the representative\nLiPSs. As displayed in Figure 7, the S@FCO-180 samples completely decolored the Li2S6\nsolution, whereas the Li2S6 solution containing S@FCO-160 and S@FCO-200 turned colors\nfrom yellow to light yellow. In addition, the UV\u2013Vis spectra showed that peaks of Li2S6\nwere significantly weaker at 262.0 nm when S@FCO-180 hosts were added to the solution.\nThe strong chemisorption between FCO-180 and LiPSs resulted in decreased peak inten-\nsities during the tests. These results further confirm the good LiPS adsorption ability of\nthe FCO-180 samples.\nIn this formula, Ip represents the peak current, n is the number of electrons transferred by charge (in LiS batteries, n = 2), A is the cathode area, DLi+ represents the diffusion coefficient of lithium ions, and CLi+ stands for the concentration of Li ions, and \u03bd represents the scan rate of cyclic voltammetry. Here Ip and \u03bd0.5 are the only two variables; the diffusion coefficie t of Li+ (DLi+) can be directly reflected by the slope of the fitting c rve (Ip/\u03bd0.5) [26\u201328]. Based on the RandlesSevcik equation, the current of the peak with S@FCO-180 electrode is higher at the same scanning speed, and the higher slope is obtained from the curves fitting process. The above result suggests that the presence of FCO-180 sea urchinlike can promote the rapid transfer of Li+, which can be attributed to the fast ion exchange and redox kinetics of FCO-180 sea urchinlike materials. The visualized adsorption ability test of LiPSs and UVvis spectroscopy was conducted to further probe the chemical interaction between different cathode materials (S@FCO160, S@FCO-180, and S@FCO-200) and LiPSs, using Li2S6 as the representative LiPSs.

It was clear that the FCO-180 electrode exhibited a stronger peak intensity and smaller redox polarization from CV curves, compared with the FCO-160 and FCO-200 electrodes, suggesting that the FCO-180 composites played relatively good electrocatalytic activity and accelerated conversion of LiPSs [29,30]. The excellent stability of FCO-180 as an efficient electrocatalyst redox reactions of LiPSs could be confirmed by the well-overlapping peaks of CV profiles in the Figure 8b. It is related to the fact that the Fe atoms are uniformly dispersed in the FCO-180 sea urchinlike, and the FCO-180 has a larger effective surface and more active sites. Furthermore, the reaction kinetics of the cells are evaluated based on a linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement. As shown in Figure 8c, the FCO-180 sea urchinlike enabled a more positive onset potential and higher current response for Li2S oxidization compared with those of FCO-160 and FCO-200. Clearly, FCO-180 sea urchinlike presented lower Tafel slopes than FCO-160 and FCO-200 for both the lithiation and delithiation processes in Figure 8d, suggesting that the conversion from short-chain Li2S to long-chain LiPSs was easier and good catalytic performance [31,32]. In general, the amount of nucleation and decomposition of Li2S during the redox reaction determines the specific capacity of the LiS batteries. In Figure 8e, the nucleation and growth of Li2S and the reduction of Li2S8 and Li2S6 corresponded to different color shades. The experiments showed that the FCO-160 and FCO-200 electrodes exhibited much later and lower current peaks than the FCO-180 electrode. In addition, the capacity of Li2S precipitation on FCO-180 (95.86 mAh g\u22121) was higher than that on FCO-160 (71.47 mAh g\u22121) and FCO-200 (55.22 mAh g\u22121).
