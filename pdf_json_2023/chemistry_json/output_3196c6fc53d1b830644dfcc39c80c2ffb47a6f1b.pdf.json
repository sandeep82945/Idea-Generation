    "abstractText": "The electron-rich five-membered aromatic aza-heterocyclic imidazole, which contains two nitrogen atoms, is an important functional fragment widely present in a large number of biomolecules and medicinal drugs; its unique structure is beneficial to easily bind with various inorganic or organic ions and molecules through noncovalent interactions to form a variety of supramolecular complexes with broad medicinal potential, which is being paid an increasing amount of attention regarding more and more contributions to imidazole-based supramolecular complexes for possible medicinal application. This work gives systematical and comprehensive insights into medicinal research on imidazole-based supramolecular complexes, including anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory aspects as well as ion receptors, imaging agents, and pathologic probes. The new trend of the foreseeable research in the near future toward imidazole-based supramolecular medicinal chemistry is also prospected. It is hoped that this work provides beneficial help for the rational design of imidazole-based drug molecules and supramolecular medicinal agents and more effective diagnostic agents and pathological probes.",

Introduction\nIntermolecular interactions have been playing a positive role in modern science for several decades [1]. Research and potential applications toward supramolecular species have been rapidly expanding and active scientific topics, strongly promoting the development of supramolecular science at a revolutionary pace. Numerous efforts have been devoted to the study of supramolecular chemistry for its possible potential, which have been expanded into many disciplines such as materials science, biology, medicine, and pharmaceutical science. A supramolecular interaction based on weak bonds (coordination bonds, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, van der Waals forces, etc.) has been widely used in molecular recognition [2,3], organic catalysis [4,5], fluorescence imaging [6,7], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [8,9], medicinal agents [10,11], and other fields. Especially regarding the medicinal aspects, many supermolecules formed by two or more molecules, such as anticancer trimolecular supramolecular complex I1, bimolecular supermolecule I2, MRI contrast agents I3 and I4, etc., have been widely used in clinical settings, showing great potential for the development of supramolecular species [1,9,10]. Importantly, the formation of supermolecules by noncovalent bonds can interfere with the function of living molecules in biological systems and make drug molecules with better solubility, higher bioavailability, better biocompatibility, better drug-targeting, fewer multidrug resistances, lower toxicity, fewer adverse effects, and better curative effects. For example, recent research [12] revealed that the artificial aminothiazolquinolone I5 was able to form a compound I5\u2212Cu2+\u2212DNA ternary supramolecular complex, in which the Cu2+ ion acts as a bridge between the backbone of 3-aminothiazolquinolone\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1348. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15051348 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1348 2 of 103\nand the phosphate group of the nucleic acid and, thus, exhibited potent antibacterial activity, low cytotoxicity to hepatocyte cells, strong inhibitory potency to DNA gyrase, and a broad antimicrobial spectrum including against multidrug-resistant strains. Anticancer drug adriamycin I6 with \u03b2-cyclodextrin could form a 1:1 organic supramolecular complex, which helpfully improved the water solubility of adriamycin I6 and, thus, resulted in its better bioavailability. Moreover, supramolecular species were relatively easily obtained with several advantages: a lower cost, a shorter time period, and a higher potential as clinical drugs with successful research and development. Therefore, many increasing efforts were recently directed toward supramolecular species to explore their possible potential [11,13]. Azole heterocycles [14\u201316] such as imidazoles [17\u201319], triazoles [20\u201323], tetriazoles [24,25], thiazoles [26\u201328], oxazoles [29,30], benzimidazoles [31,32], benzotriazoles [33,34], and carbazoles [35\u201338] have been increasingly paid attention in recent years because they are the ideal building blocks for constructing supramolecular species due to their unique electron-rich aromatic structures with nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur atoms that are capable of exerting multiple noncovalent bonds to form supramolecular species. These azoles were hybridized with sulfonamides [39\u201341], naphthalimides [42\u201344], coumarins [45\u201348], quinolones [49\u201351], quinazolones [52\u201354], berberines [55\u201358], indoles [59\u201361], purines [62,63], aloe emodins [64\u201366], pyrimidines [67,68], etc., to afford derivatives with excellent manipulation in forming biosupermolecules, which could effectively regulate the behavior of biomolecules in living systems and, thus, show a variety of good biological activities.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 107\nthe Cu2+ ion acts as a bridge between the backbone of 3-aminothiazolquinolone and the\nphosphate group of the nucleic acid and, thus, exhibited pot nt antibacterial activity, low\ncyto oxicity to hepatoc te cells, s rong inhibitory pote cy to DNA gyrase, and a broad\nantimicrobial spectrum including against multidrug-resistant strains.

It exists in two equivalent tautomers, in which hydrogen atoms\ncan be located on either of the two nitrogen atoms [17,69]. Such electron-rich nitrogen\nheterocycles not only readily accept or donate protons but also exert a variety of weak\ninteractions. Importantly, multiple binding sites of the imidazole ring can easily form im-\nidazole supramolecular complexes with various inorganic or organic ions and molecules\nthrough noncovalent interactions, showing not only the biological activity of imidazole\ndrugs themselves but also the many advantages of supramolecular drugs, which may nat-\nurally exert dual or multiple mechanisms to overcome resistance [17,18]. Many imidazole\nsupramolecular complexes showed good safety, low toxicity, few adverse reactions, high\nbioavailability, strong drug targeting, good biocompatibility, and high efficacy.

In addition, imidazole-based supramolecular complexes are widely available and easy to prepare, which makes the development cost low, the cycle short, and the possibility of druggability large, so they have been attracting increasing attention. Furthermore, many metal supramolecular complexes formed by imidazole derivatives and metal ions such as\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1348 3 of 103\nplatinum, gold, silver, palladium, ruthenium, copper, iron, rhenium, vanadium, iridium, manganese, cobalt, stannum, erbium, ytterbium, gallium, etc., have revealed promising clinical potential.

Therefore, many efforts are being focused on the research and development of imidazole-derived supermolecules as medicinal agents, which have been revealed to display wide medicinal potential as anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antiinflammatory medicinal agents [11].\n2.1. Imidazole-Based Supermolecules as Anticancer Agents\nCancer has become one of the serious diseases that increasingly threaten human health. Although many effective clinical drugs [71] such as alkylating agents [72,73],\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1348 4 of 103\nmetal and macrocyclic drugs [74\u201376], etc., have been successfully developed, the frequent emergence and diversity of cancer as well as the high toxicity and low selectivity of anticancer drugs mean the current clinical drugs are far from meeting the needs of clinical use. The development of new anticancer drugs has become quite urgent and is also one of the most heavily invested in pharmaceutical developments worldwide [77\u201379]. Imidazole compounds display a wide anticancer potential. In particular, imidazole-based supermolecules have attracted extensive attention and have become one of the new research hotspots for anticancer drugs due to their strong activity, good selectivity, safety, and multitargeting properties [80].\n2.1.1. Noble Metal-Based Imidazole Supermolecules as Anticancer Agents\nNoble metal-based supramolecular drugs have achieved great success. In particular, platinum anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and many other metal supramolecular complexes have been widely used in clinical settings. This has encouraged countless researchers to develop new cancer agents with precious metals [81\u201383]. With the wide application of imidazole drugs in the field of medicine, more and more imidazole-based supermolecules have been developed as anticancer agents.\nPlatinum-Based Imidazole Supermolecules as Anticancer Agents\nPlatinum-based metal supramolecular complexes as anticancer agents are one of the most deeply investigated metal supermolecules. Since the discovery in 1969 of supramolecular cisplatin, a three-molecule complex formed by one molecule of PtCl2 and two molecules of NH3, which shows anticancer activity, many platinum-based supramolecular complexes, such as carboplatin, sunpla, oxaliplatin, nedaplatin, and lobaplatin, have been successfully developed and widely used as anticancer drugs in clinical practice [84]. A broad anticancer spectrum and strong efficacy further stabilize their indispensable status in anticancer treatments. However, platinum-engaged anticarcinogens are confronted with severe side effects such as nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and neurotoxicity. Furthermore, a relatively weak water solubility, a difficult metabolism, and poor activities against breast cancer and colon cancer hinder their clinical application. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new and more efficient anticancer drugs [85]. Recent studies revealed that imidazole-based supermolecules show a large potential as anticancer agents. The imidazole ring has a remarkable coordination affinity for Pt (II) ions, and its complexes could inhibit tumor growth by interacting with DNA. Platinum complex II1 with an imidazole functionalized at the N1 atom surpassed cisplatin in the treatments of DLD-1 (colorectal) and MCF-7 (breast) cell lines. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of II1 were 57.4 \u00b5M for DLD-1 and 79.9 \u00b5M for MCF-7, while cisplatin was far less active when confronted with resistance. Based on the fact that p53 was induced in the exposure of the compound, which was correlated to the interaction with nuclear DNA, complex II1 might partake in the mitochondrial apoptotic process free from the p53 gene [86]. A bidentate N,N chelating ligand and 1-alkyl-2-(arylazo) imidazole were used to synthesize Pt (II) complexes II2a\u2013b. Long alkyl-substituted imidazole platinum complex II2-b showed a significant cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 cell lines and displayed a higher cytotoxic effect than complex II2-a against all cancer cell lines (A549, MCF-7, and CACO2) [87]. Pharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 107\nA double p-fluorophenyl imidazole platinum complex II3 displayed much higher an-\nticancer activities than cisplatin, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cancer\ncells. Complex II3 was confirmed to be effective as an immunogenic cell death inducer in\nHCC treatment. Its efficacy was attributed to targeting the HCC antioxidant network.\nComplex II3 rendered a new scaffold to develop chemotherapeutics capable of inducing\nimmune responses against solid tumors [88].\nA cytotoxicity evaluation identified Pt (II) imidazole compound II4 as the most prom-\nising compound, with lower IC50 values, down to 0.86 \u03bcM and 0.48 \u03bcM against MCF-7\nand MDA-MB-231 cell lines, respectively. Further investigation revealed that complex II4\nmight exert its antitumor activity by activating p53 and proline oxidase (POX) to cause an\nincrease in the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), up-regulating the pro-\napoptotic proteins and caspase cascade to mediate the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis.\nMoreover, supermolecule II4 conjugated with a dendrimer could significantly reduce the\neffect of the drug efflux responsible for drug resistance. These results suggested that com-\nplex II4 might serve as a promising candidate in the development of a novel therapeutic\nagent to treat breast cancer [89].\nMetal complexes featuring imidazole-involved nitrogen heterocyclic carbenes are\namong the basic scaffolds in anticancer agents. A four p-methoxy-benzyl-substituted\ndiimidazole Pt (II) complex II5 demonstrated high antitumor activities against HT-29 hu-\nman colon adenocarcinoma, DLD-1 colorectal adenocarcinoma, and the KB-V1/Vbl cervix\ncancer cell line [90].\nAniline-incorporated benzimidazole Pt (II) complex II6 was stable and controlled a\nwide range of anti-carcinoma spectra, which was a lethal agent against mammary cancer,\nrectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In particular, it displayed the most po-\ntent anti-breast cancer cell line activity with an IC50 value of 12.4 \u03bcM, which is almost\nrivaled by cisplatin. On the contrary, Pd (II) supermolecules were quite unstable for their\nhigh rate of ligand exchange. With the Pd (II) ion as the central ion, the anticancer activity\nof the complex was enhanced. This was mainly because the formed Pd (II) complex was\nless stable than the Pt (II) complex and easily exchanged ligands with biological macro-\nmolecules. Therefore, it was very important to select the appropriate ligands to keep the\nstructural integrity of the complex before reaching the target [91].\nPlatinum-based supramolecular complexes II7a\u2012b, formed by two molecules of ben-\nzimidazoles and one molecule of PtCl2, showed good anticancer activity. In particular, the\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1348 5 of 103\nA double p-fluorophenyl imidazole platinum complex II3 displayed much higher anticancer activities than cisplatin, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cancer cells.

A four p-methoxy-benzyl-substituted\ndiimidazole Pt (II) complex II5 demonstrated high antitumor activities against HT-29 hu-\nman colon adenocarcinoma, DLD-1 colorectal adenocarcinoma, and the KB-V1/Vbl cervix\ncancer cell line [90].\nAniline-incorporated benzimidazole Pt (II) complex II6 was stable and controlled a\nwide range of anti-carcinoma spectra, which was a lethal agent against mammary cancer,\nrectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In particular, it displayed the most po-\ntent anti-breast cancer cell line activity with an IC50 value of 12.4 \u03bcM, which is almost\nrivaled by cisplatin. On the contrary, Pd (II) supermolecules were quite unstable for their\nhigh rate of ligand exchange. With the Pd (II) ion as the central ion, the anticancer activity\nof the complex was enhanced. This was mainly because the formed Pd (II) complex was\nless stable than the Pt (II) complex and easily exchanged ligands with biological macro-\nmolecules.

Therefore, the stability of supermolecules played an important\nrole in its anticancer activity [106].\nSilver-Based Imidazole Supermolecules as Anticancer Agents\nSilver compounds have a long history as antibacterial agents.

Owning low cytotoxicity with the abilities to resist metastasis and conquer cisplatin tolerance, ruthenium supermolecules are expected to be latent anticancer candidates. Particularly, imidazole-based supermolecules have made significant progress, with imidazole-Ru (II) NAMI-A and Ru-involved pyrazole supermolecule KP1019 already undergoing clinical trials [134]. Trimolecular supermolecule II38, formed by Ru (II) together with a bidentate ligand of imidazole and carbazole, could overcome cross resistance toward cisplatin. By reacting with key protein B1 in the process of proliferation, supermolecule II38 evidently suppressed the growth of liver cancer HepG2 cells, cervical carcinoma HeLa cell lines, lung cancer A549 cells, cisplatin-tolerant lung cancer A549cisR cell lines, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE-2.

Complex II45 predominantly accumulated in the mitochondria and cytoplasm and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, whereas the more hydrophilic no-methyl-substitution complex tended to localize and accumulate in the cell nucleus and mitochondria. Further mechanism studies indicated that the no-methyl-substitution complex caused cell cycle arrest at the S phase by regulating cell cyclerelated proteins and induced apoptosis in A549 cells through DNA damage, cellular ROS accumulation, activation of the caspase pathway, and mitochondrial dysfunction [144]. Many studies revealed that the combination of different metals with the same molecule to form complexes can induce additive or even synergistic effects.

In\naddition, the antimicrobial effect was decreased when a copper ion was replaced by a zinc\nion, nickel ion, or cadmium ion, which was in accordance with their stability constant.\nWhat was revealed in the interaction mechanism was that the complexes prohibited pep-\ntidoglycan, the major component of cell walls, from being synthesized to exert antimicro-\nbial capability [321].\nPyridine, as a significant heterocyclic biological electron equivalence of benzene, is\nalso extensively used in medicine, pesticides, and the dyestuff industry. Pyridine-modi-\nfied benzimidazole and glycinate could coordinate with a Cu (II) ion to generate complex\nII164, which performed well in fighting against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and\nSalmonella. A structure-activity relationship study showed that thiazole taking the place\nof pyridine at the C-2 position of benzimidazole led to less antibacterial activity, which\nwas four times less potent than compound II164. Similarly, in Pd (II) supramolecular com-\nplex II165, the antibacterial activity of the complex decreased when the pyridine at the 2-\nposition of benzimidazole was replaced by benzimidazole. The result showed that pyri-\ndine-substituted ligands played an important role in the antibacterial exertion [322].\nTernary complex II163 was made up of aliphatic amine-substituted benzimidazole, glycine, and a Cu (II) ion. It was demonstrated in a study that scarcely any activity was found in complex II163 toward Pseudomonas, but good inhibitory activity was shown agai st Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcu , and Escherichia c li, especially for Bacillus subtilis, with a MIC value of 6.25 \u00b5g/mL. Further research found that th complex performed more actively toward Gram-positive bacte ia than Gram-negative bact ria, which was mainly attributed to the more complicated structure of the Gram-negative bacteria\u2019s cell walls. In addition, the antimicrobial effect was decreased when a copper ion was replaced by a zinc ion, nickel ion, or cadmium ion, which was in accordance with their stability constant. What was revealed in the interaction mechanism was that the complexes prohibited peptidoglycan, the major component of cell walls, from being synthesized to exert antimicrobial capability [321].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1348 45 of 103\nPyridine, as a significant heterocyclic biological electron equivalence of benzene, is also extensively used in medicine, pesticides, and the dyestuff industry.

The antibacterial ability of the copper phenylalanine supramolecular complex against Staphylococcus aureus was the best. A further antibacterial mechanism showed that the IC50 values of the perchlorate Cu (II) complex and the phenylalanine Cu (II) complex inhibiting topoisomerase I were about 20 mol/L, which was equivalent to the effect of a classical topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin [346].

Imidazole-Based Supermolecules as Antifungal Agents\nFungal infection, which is quite normal and frequent, is responsible for the deaths of\nimmunocompromised patients, as one recent factor [366\u2013368]. The first developed azole\nantifungal drugs were of the imidazole type; so far, a large number of imidazole-based\nantifungal drugs have been successfully marketed and widely used in clinical settings. For\nexample, ketoconazole, miconazole, econazole, and other many imidazole-based drugs\nshowed a benign antifungal ability. Along with the emergence of drug-resistant fungal\nstrains caused by the wide use or even abuse of antifungal drugs, the diminishing thera-\npeutic ability of current antifungal drugs has brought a severe threat to human health\n[369\u2013371]. Hence, it has become more and more important to develop safer and more ef-\nficient antifungal agents [372]. In terms of complexes, they have been increasingly re-\nsearched for their good hydrophilicity, bioavailability, and other advantages, revealing\ntheir unique value within antifungal medicinal science.

Trichinosis is the most human-susceptible parasitic disease, in the forms of raw or undercooked meat with larvae in human food, which results in ailments. Albendazole (ABZ) and mebendazole (MBZ) are extensively employed in treating trichinosis such as Trichinellosis, Echinococcis, and Neurocysticercosis.

Diabetes has become one of the greatest challenges facing science in the 21st century. It is a recognized multifactorial health problem that causes serious health complications, which is mainly associated with cardiovascular disease, kidney injury, and neuropathy, resulting in significantly high mortality [409]. This has attracted great attention worldwide, and much related work is devoted to research on and the development of hypoglycemic drugs. At present, the drugs that have been used in clinical settings, such as acarbose, metformin, and miglitol, have adverse side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, which hinder their application [410\u2013412]. Therefore, finding new, more effective antidiabetic drugs, with fewer side effects and a lower cost, is still a fascinating research field. In this context, recent studies have found that imidazole-based heterocycle complexes are of great importance in mitigating insulin resistance and enhancing insulin secretion for their high bioavailabilities and weak drug interactions, thus opening up a new perspective for developing novel and highly active antidiabetic agents. The enzyme protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) are known to be involved in the mechanism of glucose transport into the cell. Imidazole vanadium metal complex II223, as an inhibitor exclusively for PTP-1B, exhibited better potential in reducing serum glucose levels than metformin. It behaved as an inhibitor to suppress the overexpression of the PTP-1B enzyme, for which the inhibition was competitive [413]. The search for similar, newer antidiabetic complexes has become an interesting area of current biochemical research. As for the present tridentate Schiff base, no report on the structural characterization and its chelate with vanadium appear to have been reported. Two dioxidovanadium (V) complexes II224a-b incorporating tridentate ligand nicotinic acid and imidazoles were synthesized. Antidiabetic features such as \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition made them promising agents as inhibitors of insulin enzymes. Methylimidazole complex II224-b had low IC50 values toward the inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase, which was similar to the control acarbose. It was, thus, revealed that imidazole complex II224-a showed the highest in vitro \u03b1-amylase (insulin-mimetic) activity among the compounds examined in this study, with an IC50 value of 23.669 [414]. The potential applicability of palladium complexes containing imidazole ligands for medicinal purposes prompted us to study their structure and biological activity. Palladium (II) complex II225, formed by two molecules 1,2-dimethylimidazole and one molecule of palladium chloride, demonstrated an IC50 value as low as 7.04 \u00b5g/mL, which was far less than that of acarbose (IC50 = 33.73 \u00b5g/mL).

Compound III4 was inclined to coordinate with Hg (II) ions via the thiophene residue and inhibited the charge-transfer (CT) process, leading to an apparent color change from a yellow-colored solution to a colorless one. In addition, when Cu (II) ions were added, an unusually large bathochromic shift phenomenon was observed, accompanied by a change in color from yellow to red. This result accounted for the formation of the 6-imino-5,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-d] imidazole4(3H)-one (IPIMO) derivative with the catalysis of the Cu (II) ions, which strongly affected the charge-transfer state of the compound as well as its polarizability [442].\nA pyridine arm-modified imidazole compound III5 was a highly selective fluorescent \u201cturn-on\u201d receptor for the Cu (II) ions. In addition, the composition of III5\u2013Al (III) and III5\u2013Cu (II) systems could detect Br\u2212 and I\u2212 through color change. Importantly, receptor III5 was successfully used to detect Al (III) ions in living A549 cells [443]. The bifunctional probe of 2-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1H-phenol[9,10-d] imidazole III6 was used as a ratio-sensitive sensor. It was found that receptor III6 showed good recognition ability for Cu (II) ions. According to Job\u2019s diagram, the binding stoichiometry of a receptor with a cation complex was 1:1. The density functional theory results clearly demonstrated that the binding modes and the properties of these receptors could be used as selective fluorescent sensors for analytes with the ratiometric response and found potential applications in biological systems [444]. A trisubstituted imidazole-based colorimetric and fluorogenic chemosensor III7, for the detection of Cu (II) ions and subsequent colorimetric detection of an amino acid, cysteine, was investigated. Chemosensor III7 exhibited a distinct color change from colorless to red in the presence of Cu (II) ions in an aqueous medium. The III7\u2013Cu (II) complex could also be used to detect cysteine with the naked eye over a series of amino acids. The receptor III7 behaved as a highly selective colorimetric and fluorescent sensor for Cu (II) ions at concentrations as low as 4.33 and 2.25 \u00b5M, respectively. These values were much less compared to the WHO\u2019s recommended limit of 30 \u00b5M for Cu (II) ions in drinking water [445]. A highly selective Ru (II)-polypyridyl-based chemosensor III8 has been developed for the rapid analysis of Cu (II) ions in aqueous solution and on paper strips. Complex III8 displayed excellent fluorescence quenching when binding with Cu (II) ions, and the limit of detection was computed to be 50.67 nM, which was much lower than the allowable Cu (II) ion standard (~20 \u00b5M) in drinking water. Interestingly, Cu (II) ion sensing was found to be reversible with EDTA addition [446].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1348 65 of 103\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 68 of 107 process, leading to an apparent color change from a yellow-colored solution to a colorless one.

In addition, the composition of III5\u2013Al (III) and III5\u2013Cu (II) systems could detect Br\u2012 and I\u2012 through color change. Importantly, receptor III5 was successfully used to detect Al (III) ions in living A549 cells [443]. The bifunctional probe of 2-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1H-phenol[9,10-d] imidazole III6 was used as a ratio-sensitive sensor. It was found that receptor III6 showed good recognition ability for Cu (II) ions. According to Job\u2019s diagram, the binding stoichiometry of a receptor with a cation complex was 1:1. The density functional theory results clearly demonstrated that the binding modes and the properties of these receptors could be used as selective fluorescent sensors for analytes with the ratiometric response and found potential applications in biological systems [444]. A trisubstituted imidazole-based colorimetric and fluorogenic chemosensor III7, for the detection of Cu (II) ions and subsequent colorimetric detection of an amino acid, cysteine, was investigated. Chemosensor III7 exhibited a distinct color change from colorless to red in the presence of Cu (II) ions in an aqueous medium. The III7\u2013Cu (II) complex could also be used to detect cysteine with the naked eye over a series of amino acids. The receptor III7 behaved as a highly selective colorimetric and fluorescent sensor for Cu (II) ions at concentrations as low as 4.33 and 2.25 \u03bcM, respectively. These values were much less compared to the WHO\u2019s recommended limit of 30 \u03bcM for Cu (II) ions in drinking\nwater [445].\nA highly selective Ru (II)-polypyridyl-based chemosensor III8 has been developed\nfor the rapid analysis of Cu (II) ions in aqueous solution and on paper strips.

Since imidazole groups can bind anions in aqueous solutions, their derivatives with different topological characteristics are widely used for sensing various anions. In the recent years, the development of imidazole receptors has made new important contributions, such as the combination of imidazole and halogen bonds, the expansion of imidazole coupling systems, and the creation of new scaffolds.

This ligand showed a selective sensing ability toward Zn (II) ions, and the detection limit was calculated as 3.09 \u00d7 10\u22127 M [507].\n5.3.8. Imidazole-Based Supermolecules as Probes to Detect Copper Ions\nAs is well-known, excess copper causes Wilson\u2019s, prion, and Menkes diseases. The permitted concentration of Cu (II) ions in drinking water, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is 20 \u03bcM. Therefore, it is important to develop an ultrasensitive and selective method for the determination of Cu (II) ions in environmental water samples [508].\nAllyl-substituted imidazole derivative V24 exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity toward the detection of Cu (II) ions through the formation of a 2:1 complex with Cu (II) ions. The detection limit for Cu (II) ions was 1.01 nM. Chemosensor V24 was used as an efficient colorimetric and fluorometric nanoprobe for the quantitation of Cu (II) ions in real environmental w ter s mples such as drinking water and mineral water, with good recoveries percentages and acceptable RSD percentages [508].\nDibenzimidazole derivative V25 could act as a fluorescent chemical sensor and show a faster coordination effect with metal ions and a lower detection limitation than the known Cu (II) ions\u2019 fluorescent molecule. The limit detection of the probe was low, down to 0.094 \u03bcM, with a complex constant of 6.57 \u00d7 10\u22128 M\u22121, which showed a high sensibility toward copper ions. In ad n, this probe was used to etect copper i ns in tap water, river water, and seawater, whi demonstrated its potential applic tion in seawater. More importantly, the response time of the probe to copper ions was within 1 s [509].\nTetraphenyl ethylene-functionalized aryl imidazole-derivative V26 showed excellent aggregation-induced emission properties. The hydroxyl group and the N atom of imidazole were good binding sites for metal ions, making compound V26 an excellent bidentate ligand. The unique molecular structure design enabled the special sensing of Cu (II) ions. Tetraphenyl ethylene-functionalized aryl imidazole-derivative V26 showed excellent aggregation-induced emission properties. The hydroxyl group and the N atom of imidazole were good binding s tes for metal io aking compound V26 an excellent bidentate ligand. The unique molecular structure desig enabled the special sensing of Cu (II) ions. The chelation of compound V26 with Cu (II) ions could induce the formation of a stable Cu(V26)2 complex to quench fluorescence. Therefore, compound V26 was also used to detect Cu (II) ions in an aqueous solution medium, with an LOD of 34.8 nM [510].\n5.3.9. Imidazole-Based Supermolecules as Probes to Detect Iron Ions\nIron is one of the most important elements in the metabolic process and is indispensable to all life systems, so it is widely distributed in the environment and biomaterials. However, concentrations in humans below or above the normally permissible limits can cause serious disease. Therefore, there is a need to develop fluorescent probes that can easily and quickly detect Fe (III) ions through fluorescence enhancement to understand the physiological and pathological contributions of Fe (III) ions to living systems [511]. Fluorescence \u201con-off\u201d aniline-derived imidazole probe V27 was synthesized via a soft and high-efficiency one-pot microwave-assisted method under solvent-free conditions. It was found that probe V27 exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity toward Fe (III) ions. Probe V27 could bind with Fe (III) ions in a ratio of 1:1 to form a supramolecular complex. The addition of Fe (III) ions to probe V27 in DMF/H2O (2:3) displayed significant fluorescence quenching at 388 nm. Moreover, the detection limit for Fe (III) ions was calculated to be 0.72 \u00b5mol/L, along with a relatively fast response time (30 min) [512].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 85 of 107\nThe chelation of compound V26 with Cu (II) ions could induce the formation of st ble Cu(V26)2 complex to quench fluorescence.

All these preliminary investigations suggested a large potential of imidazole-based supramolecular complexes in a wide range of areas, which greatly promote more and more scientific concerns toward imidazole-based supramolecular complexes for all possible applications. The enticing various medicinal potentials of imidazole supramolecular complexes will surely spur increasingly vigorous efforts toward the design, construction, structure, properties, and applicable medicinal potential of imidazole-derived supramolecular complexes. The related work will become more and more active, and some hot topics of the new trend of the foreseeable research in the near future toward imidazole-based medicinal supramolecular complexes might appear with the following aspects. (1). The design of imidazole-derived supramolecular complexes with large medicinal druggability will become increasingly active. The unique imidazole ring gives the strong ability of imidazole derivatives to demonstrate supramolecular behaviors. The multiple binding sites of the imidazole ring can easily form imidazole supramolecular complexes with various inorganic or organic ions and biomacromolecules such as enzymes, receptors, DNA, etc., through noncovalent interactions, showing not only the biological activity of the imidazole drugs themselves but also the many advantages of supramolecular drugs; naturally, these may exert dual or multiple mechanisms to overcome the serious, globally increasing drug resistance. In particular, the design of drug molecules based on supramolecular interaction will attract more and more attention. A design that can effectively interact with biological macromolecules to produce strong biological effects, to obtain highly active drug molecules, will be a challenging and great scientific topic. (2). The efficient construction of medicinal imidazole supramolecular complexes will be an important research direction. The economic preparation through the use of the imidazole ring, which can access the unique structural frameworks of medicinal imidazole supramolecular complexes, will be pursued aggressively for possible practical application. Imidazole derivatives with novel structures may exhibit better biological activity. The introduction of functional groups with a strong coordination ability and low toxicity and the search for highly active imidazole ligands are important components in the development of medicinal imidazole supermolecules.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1348 82 of 103\n(3). The supramolecular structures of medicinal imidazole supermolecules will attract much interest. The assembly and generation of unique supramolecular structures through multiple coordination modes, especially multitargeting ligands with unique mechanisms of action, will attract more attention because they are beneficial for affording the high potential of medicinal imidazole supermolecules. (4). More and more efforts will be directed toward the relative ADMET property of medicinal imidazole supramolecular complexes. ADME assessment is an important work of medicinal imidazole supramolecular complexes, so their investigation will help to discover the highly active medicinal imidazole molecules with satisfactory ADME properties including good solubility and bioavailability, low toxicity and side effects, and no drug resistance. (5). Increasing contributions will target all possible medicinal potentials of imidazole supramolecular complexes. The large potential for the clinical treatment of imidazole supramolecular complexes as medicinal agents will promote more and more efforts to investigate all possible medical potentials, extending beyond the current anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and antitubercular aspects to other medicinal areas. The imidazole ring has multiple binding sites and can interact with various anions, cations, and biomolecules in the human body. Imidazole-based supermolecules, as artificial receptors and fluorescent molecules, will expand to extensively explore their possible applications in the biological systems of diagnostic and pathological probes. (6). The study of the structure-activity relationship of imidazole-based supramolecular complexes will be increasingly important. The study of the relationship between the structure of imidazole-based supermolecules and their water solubility, liposolubility, and biological activity is conducive to the development of new medicinal imidazole supermolecules. (7). The discovery of novel and unique supramolecular drug mechanisms and the identification of supramolecular drug targets will become increasingly prominent. It is very important to reveal new action mechanisms and identify the targets for new imidazole drug discovery. There is no doubt that the further expansion of research toward imidazole-based supramolecular complexes will promote the development of more and more imidazolebased drugs with better activity, lower toxicity, and better pharmacokinetic properties as well as more effective diagnostic agents and pathological probes for further clinical medicinal use in contributions to the sustainable and healthy development of humankind.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.Z. and C.-H.Z.; methodology, S.-R.L. and Y.-M.T.; software, S.-R.L. and Y.-M.T.; validation, S.-R.L., Y.-M.T., L.Z. and C.-H.Z.; formal analysis, S.-R.L. and Y.-M.T.; investigation, S.-R.L. and Y.-M.T.; resources, L.Z. and C.-H.Z.; data curation, S.-R.L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.-R.L. and Y.-M.T.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.-R.L., Y.-M.T., L.Z. and C.-H.Z.; visualization, S.-R.L., Y.-M.T., L.Z. and C.-H.Z.; supervision, L.Z. and C.-H.Z.; project administration, C.-H.Z.; funding acquisition, C.-H.Z.
