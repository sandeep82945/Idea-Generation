First, we extend the use of a perturbative approach that allows us to quickly and analytically calculate the position and shape of the images of a circular source lensed by a galaxy. Such approach will be compared with that obtained from the numerical solution of the lens equations. Secondly, we introduce a 3-dimensional spheroidal model to describe the spacetime associated with the dark matter halo around the lens galaxy and an associated optical metric to incorporate the presence of the plasma medium. The (chromatic) deformation on caustic and critical curves and associated multiplicity of images is also analyzed for particular configurations.\nPACS numbers:\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn general, in the optical geometric limit, electromagnetic radiation propagates along non geodesic curved trajectories when interacting with an in-homogeneous optical medium, as opposed to the geodesic paths in the gravity pure case. While such optical phenomena are well-known in Earthbound laboratories, analogous optical effects have also been observed to occur in astrophysical scenarios across the electromagnetic spectrum. Due to rays passing through an intervening optical medium, a viewer may observe multiple images of distant objects, distorted and apparently shifted from their true locations. In fact, such cosmic lensing scenarios can display both converging and diverging behaviour depending on the nature of the lenses involved.\nGravitational lensing occurs when light rays passes by a massive object. In this case, the curvature of spacetime behaves as an effective optical medium that depends on the derivatives of components of the metric of the spacetime produced by the lens [1\u20133]. As an example, an isolated point mass generally behaves like a converging lens, acting to magnify a well-aligned distant source. Since all frequencies of radiation are affected equally by spacetime curvature, gravitational lensing effects are achromatic. At present, gravitational lensing is known on many scales, ranging from micro-arcsecond images arising from individual stellar lenses [4] to galaxies [5] and entire galaxy clusters [6].\nIn contrast to gravitation, the ionized matter of the interstellar medium (ISM) may also act as an optical medium to affect our view of distant objects, albeit an optical medium with vastly different properties than grav-\nitational fields. The plasma component of the turbulent and clumpy ISM may obscure background radio sources, causing demagnification analogous to a diverging lens [7]. Due to the frequency dependence of the plasma dispersion relation, the lensing effect of plasma lenses are chromatic, strongly altering the paths of radio waves[8\u201312]. It is believed that such plasma structures are responsible for extreme scattering events (ESEs)[13, 14], in which the flux density of radio-loud background sources (1 GHz) are observed to dim by large amounts (exceeding 50%) [15]. The ESE phenomena may also be closely related to pulsar scintillation, which has been the motivation behind many exotic plasma distributions beyond simple spherical symmetry such as filaments [16, 17] and sheets of ionized matter [18, 19]. In fact, plasma lenses do not display exclusively diverging optical behaviour, since they can also be under-densities in an over-dense background. Such \u2019pits\u2019 then behave like converging chromatic lenses [20], however recent observations seem to exclude this possibility at least for a subset of observed ESEs [14]. One of the most striking observations of plasma lensing has occurred due to the observation of a black widow pulsar through the ablated wind of its companion [21, 22]. Plasma lenses have also been suggested to affect the propagation of fast radio bursts [23, 24]. Therefore, plasma lenses are highly relevant to topics on the leading edge of astrophysics. However, many aspects of these phenomena remain mysterious, in particular the small physical extent of spherically symmetric models suggest extremely large central densities [15]. Therefore, further study of these enigmatic structures is necessary.\nIn this work we are interested in the study of lens effects produced by the presence of plasma in strong lensing situations, that is, when multiple source images are\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n14 29\n7v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n2 2\nM ay\n2 02\n3\n2 produced and they are highly distorted. Some studies on strong gravitational lensing+plasma phenomena have been previously analyzed by various authors; for example to analyze how the presence of plasma atmospheres in neutron stars affects the luminosity curves[25\u201328], or the shadow of black holes [29\u201335] (strong lensing+strong field effects); or even to the study of arc lensing formation (through ray tracing numerical integration) when the acting lenses are formed by galaxies [36], or in a situations of microlensing [37, 38] (strong lensing + weak field). Note that as in [36] the ray tracing integration has been carried out numerically, it is difficult in many situations to make a more detailed study of how the different parameters that describe the plasma affect the formation of images and their multiplicity. It is our intention to contribute with a more detailed study on the effect of plasma in galaxies on images from distant sources, for which we will present a series of contributions: a) we analyze more generic plasma models than those usually studied that are spherically symmetric, b ) we present a perturbative formulation of the solutions to the lens equation, when in addition to the gravitational field, the presence of plasma is taken into account, which will allow us to give analytical formulas to describe the images c) a lens given described by a 3-dimensional spheroidal model and the study of light rays in the strong lens regime.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec.(II) we present the basic equations and an extension of a perturbative method to solve the lens equations originally introduced by Alard[39] for the gravitational pure case. We also present a general formula for an iterative solution of the perturbative equations. In (III) we present the models for the gravitational potentials and plasma profiles, and their effect on the lensed images. In Sec.(IV) we carry out a comparison between the analytical and the numerical solutions and the improvement that successive iterations can produce. In Sec.(V) we describe the critical and caustic curves and the multiplicity of the images for the considered models. In Sec.(VI) we change our approach, introducing a full 4-dimensional metric describing a 3D spheroidal model for the dark matter halo of the galaxy that act as a lens. Different optical scalars, critical and caustic curves and images of the lensed sources are also studied.\nThroughout this paper we assume flat \u039bCDM cosmol-\nogy with \u2126m = 0.315, and H0 = 67.4 km s\u22121\nMpc , based on the\nobservations of the Planck collaboration[40]. In addition, we consider a lens and a source with redshift zl = 0.04 and zs = 0.1, respectively."

            "text": "In the thin lens approximation, the lens equation relating the positions of the source to those of the images through the angle of deflection and can be written as\nfollows,\n\u03b2\u20d7 = \u03b8\u20d7 \u2212 \u03b1, (1)\nwhere \u03b2\u20d7, \u03b8\u20d7 denote the angular position of the source and of the image, respectively, and \u03b1 is related to the deflection angle \u03b1\u0302 by \u03b1 = DlsDs \u03b1\u0302. In addition, Dl, Ds and Dls indicate the angular diameter distance of the observer to the lens, the observer to the source and the lens to the source. Let us consider as a model for the lens a static and asymptotically flat spacetime, with coordinates {x0, xi}, with xi, i = 1..3 being spacelike coordinates. On the other hand, we will also consider in this section that the spatial components of the energy-momentum tensor are negligible, so the gravitational lens (not counting the plasma) will be completely described by its matter distribution. Under this assumption the lens equation can be rewritten in terms of the lens potential \u03c8grav as follows,\n\u03b2\u20d7 = \u03b8\u20d7 \u2212\u2207\u03b8\u20d7\u03c8grav(\u03b8\u20d7), (2)\nwhich is related to the the deflection angle \u03b1 through \u03b1(\u03b8\u20d7) = \u2207\u03b8\u20d7\u03c8grav(\u03b8\u20d7), where \u2207\u03b8\u20d7 is the gradient with respect to angular position \u03b8\u20d7 in the lens plane. We refer \u03c8grav as the effective lensing potential and it is related to the Newtonian potential \u03a6 as follows,\n\u03c8grav(\u03b8\u20d7) = Dls DlDs 2 c2\n\u222b \u03a6(Dl\u03b8\u20d7, x)dx, (3)\nbeing x the line of sight distance between the observer and the source Since we are interested in the average plasma medium surrounding galaxies, for our purposes, it will suffice to consider it as a cold, non-magnetized plasma. Neglecting the birefringence effects of galactic magnetic fields is based on the assumption that they are generally expected to be of very low intensity (of the order of a few \u00b5G [41]), and therefore their effects on image formation will be negligible. However, they could be considered if one wishes to study the polarization of light due to the Faraday rotation effect[42]. In turn, magnetic fields must be taken into account in situations of plasma lensing in the vicinity of compact objects. In that situations, the plasma lensing effect can be useful in constraining the value of magnetic fields[43]. As the observation frequencies will generally be higher than the associated plasma frequencies, the ISM can be considered an electromagnetic continuous medium with an associated refractive index [23, 44\u201346].\nn2(x) = 1\u2212 \u03c9 2 e(x i)\n\u03c92(xi) , (4)\nwhere \u03c9(xi) is the frequency of the light ray at xi and the electron plasma frequency \u03c9e(x\ni) is related to the electron number density ne(x i) as follows,\n\u03c92e(x i) =\n4\u03c0e2\nm2e ne(x\ni), (5)\n3 where e and me are the electron charge and the electron mass, respectively.\nIn analogy with the gravitational lensing theory, the cold non-magnetized plasma effect on the light rays can be codified in a frequency-dependent effective potential [13],\n\u03a6(xi) \u2248 c 2\u03c92e(x i)\n4\u03c92(xi) . (6)\nIn 6 we use the large observational frequency limit, \u03c9 \u226b \u03c9e, which is suitable in general astrophysical situations. In turn, on its way from the source to the observer, the light will experience a gravitational redshift due to the presence of the lens and a cosmological redshift, the former being negligible with respect to the latter because the lens-observer distance is large enough. For this reason we will only take into account the effect of the cosmological redshift so that the frequency of the photons in the position of the lens will be (1 + zl)\u03c9, where zl is the cosmological redshift of the lens and \u03c9 is the observational measured angular frequency.\nConsidering a light ray propagating through the plasma in a x\u0302 direction, the electron column density Ne is given by the following expression usually known as dispersion measure,\nNe(\u03b8\u20d7) = \u222b ne(x i(x))dx, (7)\nwhich can be estimated from time delay measurements. Finally, the effective lensing potential in terms of the observational frequency \u03c9, the effective lensing potential is given by [13],\n\u03c8plasma(\u03b8\u20d7, \u03c9) = Dls DsDl\n2\u03c0c2\n\u03c92(1 + zl)2 reNe(\u03b8\u20d7), (8)\nwhere re = e2\nmec2 is the classical electron radius and the\nobservation frequency \u03bd measured in Hz is related to \u03c9 by \u03bd = \u03c92\u03c0 . Therefore, the total deflection angle will be given by \u03b1(\u03b8\u20d7) = \u2207\u03b8\u20d7(\u03c8grav(\u03b8\u20d7) + \u03c8plasma(\u03b8\u20d7, \u03c9)). Note that the total deflection angle in this approximation is curl-free. Hence, the associated optical scalars can be described by the shear and convergence as in standard gravitational lensing theory. It is also worth mentioning that, in contrast to the convergent effect on light rays produced by gravitational fields, plasma lensing can produce a divergent effect if there is an over-density of electronic charge with respect to the ISM. In contrast, plasma lenses that are under-dense compared to the surrounding ISM will produce converging lenses and magnify background sources.\nIt is important to note that in this work we will not consider the plasma-gravity interaction which in the situations under consideration is negligible compared to the pure gravity contribution as well as the pure plasma one."

            "text": "In the following we will briefly review a perturbative solution of the lens equation in the strong gravitational lensing regime that is often accurate for describing gravitational arcs as well as multiple images. This method introduced by Alard (see [39]) starts from an exact solution of the gravitational lens equation for a point source aligned with the line of sight for a spherically symmetric lens, resulting in a circular image of the source generally known as Einstein ring. Let us consider a circular source with (angular) radius \u03b4\u03b2s centered at (\u03b4\u03b210, \u03b4\u03b220) in the source plane. Explicitly,\n\u03b4\u03b2\u20d7 = ( \u03b4\u03b21 \u03b4\u03b22 ) = ( \u03b4\u03b210 + \u03b4\u03b2s cos\u03d5s \u03b4\u03b220 + \u03b4\u03b2s sin\u03d5s ) , with 0 \u2264 \u03d5s \u2264 2\u03c0. (9) On the other hand, each point ot the boundary of the\nsource will have an image position \u03b8\u20d7 that can be written as,\n\u03b8\u20d7 = ( \u03b81 \u03b82 ) = ( \u03b8 cos\u03d5 \u03b8 sin\u03d5 ) , with 0 \u2264 \u03d5 \u2264 2\u03c0, (10)\nwith \u03b8 = |\u03b8\u20d7| depending on \u03d5. Therefore, in a gravitational lensing system where the effect of the plasma surrounding the lens is also taken into account, the lensing equation is given as follows,\n\u03b4\u03b210 + \u03b4\u03b2s cos\u03d5s = \u03b8 cos\u03d5\u2212 cos\u03d5 \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202\u03b8 +\nsin\u03d5\n\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03d5 ,(11)\n\u03b4\u03b220 + \u03b4\u03b2s sin\u03d5s = \u03b8 sin\u03d5\u2212 sin\u03d5 \u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03b8 \u2212 cos\u03d5 \u03b8 \u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03d5 .(12)\nwhere\n\u03c8 = \u03c8(\u03b8, \u03d5) = \u03c8grav(\u03b8, \u03d5) + \u03c8plasma(\u03b8, \u03d5). (13)\nIn particular, these equations imply the following [47],\n\u03b8 = \u03b4\u03b210 cos\u03d5+ \u03b4\u03b220 sin\u03d5+ \u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03b8 \u00b1 \u221a \u2206exact, (14)\nwith \u2206exact = \u03b4\u03b2 2 s\u2212 ( 1\n\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202\u03d5 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b210 sin\u03d5+ \u03b4\u03b220 cos\u03d5\n)2 . (15)\nNote that eq.(14) is an exact and implicit equation for \u03b8. We will now review the perturbative method introduced by Alard to solve the lens equation and we will present a new iterative expression that improves its first order approximation. It should be noted that this method was presented in the case of pure gravity and here we are extending it to the case with plasma. Let us start by considering a spherically symmetric lens characterized by a lens potential \u03c80(\u03b8) around the line of sight. This potential can have the contribution of both gravitational field and the plasmatic medium. Let\n4 us consider a point source located along the line of sight\nat \u03b2\u20d7 = 0. In this situation the lens equation reduces to,\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u2202\u03c80(\u03b8) \u2202\u03b8 = 0. (16)\nWe denote its solutions as \u03b8p. In the pure gravity case, these solutions are known as the Einstein radius and we will denote them as \u03b8E or |\u03b8\u20d7E |. As we will see, the solution \u03b8p will also have a ring shape in the image plane, but we will reserve the term Einstein ring for the pure gravity case.\nOn the other hand, we will work with mass and plasma profiles that are commonly used in astrophysics and that present these two characteristics: a) there is a solution to equation (16) and b) they present a unique circular solution in the plane of the images (Einstein ring in pure gravity case). Other plasma profiles, different from those used in this work, allow us to obtain several of these circular solutions to equation (16), such as polynomial plasma models [37]. Although the perturbative method presented in this section does not present any impediment to treat these cases, we will leave its study for later works.\nLet us now consider a small deviation in the position of the source as well as in the circular symmetry of the lens potential, that is, we will introduce a small ellipticity in the lens potential,\n\u03b2\u20d7 = \u03b4\u03b2\u20d7,\n\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7) =\u03c80(|\u03b8\u20d7|) + \u03b4\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7). (17)\nWe will also assume that these small deviations in the circular symmetry and in the position of the source will imply a small deviation of the background solution, which presents a circular shape in the plane of the images. Then introducing the following decomposition,\n\u03b8\u20d7 = \u03b8\u20d7pE + \u03b4\u03b8\u20d7, (18)\nthe lens equation can be rewritten as,\n\u03b4\u03b2\u20d7 = \u03b8\u20d7pE + \u03b4\u03b8\u20d7 \u2212\u2207\u03b8\u20d7[\u03c80(|\u03b8\u20d7|) + \u03b4\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7)]\u03b8\u20d7=\u03b8\u20d7p+\u03b4\u03b8\u20d7. (19)\nEven more, we assume the three quantities \u03b4\u03b2\u20d7, \u03b4\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7) and\n\u03b4\u03b8\u20d7 are of the same order of magnitude. To this order the perturbed lens equation is written as follows,\n\u03b4\u03b2\u20d7 = \u03b4\u03b8\u20d7 \u2212 [(\u03b4\u03b8\u20d7 \u00b7 \u2207\u03b8\u20d7)\u2207\u03b8\u20d7\u03c80(|\u03b8\u20d7|) +\u2207\u03b8\u20d7\u03b4\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7)]|\u03b8\u20d7=\u03b8\u20d7p .

In the first part of this work we will only consider galaxy lenses with an gravitational elliptical lensing potential modelled by the singular isothermal elliptical model (SIE) which is widely used to model dark matter halos in galaxies both in the theory of gravitational lensing and in studies of stellar dynamics. In section VI we will perform a detailed analysis of lensing effect produced by a specific 3D spheroidal model which is an exact solution of the Einstein equations.\nSIE profile is characterized by the following lens potential,\n\u03c8grav(\u03b8\u20d7) = \u03b8E\u03b8 \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b7 cos 2\u03d5 (29)\nwhere \u03b7 is the ellipticity, \u03b8 \u2261 |\u03b8\u20d7| and \u03b8E \u2261 |\u03b8\u20d7E | is the Einstein ring which is given in terms of the velocity dispersion \u03c3c as follows,\n\u03b8E = 4\u03c0 \u03c32c c2 Dls Ds . (30)\nRegarding the electron density profile models around galaxies, we will consider different continuous distributions. Some of these models were introduced in the literature to fit data from other galaxies [48\u201350] or our own galaxy [51\u201354]. In the latter case, these models (with different levels of sophistication) were constructed from the dispersion measure associated to pulsars and also take into account the contribution of the Magellanic Clouds and the intergalactic medium. These models are very useful to analyze distances to pulsars in our own galaxy. Moreover, in [50], the LOFAR Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) was used to investigate the radio continuum spectra for a large sample of nearby star-forming galaxies using some of the models discussed here.\nIn general, the observation frequency will be larger than the plasma frequency. Therefore, the plasma environment will produce a small difference in the position and shape of the images with respect to the highfrequency optical limit (pure gravity case). However, as we will see in the next sections, for particular electron density profiles, observation frequencies and for some given orientation of the observer, the multiplicity of images can change. We refer to [55\u201357] for observational works on multiple imaging in plasma lensing.\nWe will start with a spherically symmetric electron distribution with an exponential decay and then we will consider other less restrictive profiles.\nFirst of all, we need to specify the coordinate system that we will use. As we can see en Fig. 1 we have chosen the x\u2032-axis in such a way that it coincides with line of\nsight while the plane of the lens coincides with the y\u2032z\u2032 one. In addition, we have defined in the same plane the angle \u03c6 as shown and a radial cylindrical coordinates rc is defined in the x\u2032y\u2032-plane (not shown). We reserve r as a spherical radial coordinate. Then it is straightforward to check the following relationships,\ny\u2032 = b cos\u03c6 = Dl\u03b8 cos\u03c6, (31) z\u2032 = b sin\u03c6 = Dl\u03b8 sin\u03c6, (32)\nrc = \u221a x\u20322 + (Dl\u03b8 cos\u03c6)2, (33)\nr = \u221a x\u20322 + (Dl\u03b8)2.

            "text": "As a first model we will consider a spherically symmetric electron density with exponential decay given by the following expression,\nne(r) = n0e \u2212r/rp . (35)\nThe effect of this kind of plasma profiles on image formation has already been numerically analyzed in the past by Er and Mao in [36]. Here we will develop a perturbative analysis. In turn, this kind of model will serve as a seed to obtain the dispersion measure in more generic models that do not respect spherical symmetry and that will be discussed in the next subsections. This model is inspired by observational fits proposed in the past to study the distribution of ions in H II regions of several galaxies. In [48], based on observations of the galaxy M51 (a galaxy facing the line of sight), values of the electron density n0 = 10cm\n\u22123, and 1kpc for the characteristic radius rp were estimated. Although in such a galaxy r fulfills the role of galactocentric radius, measured in the direction of\n6\nthe plane that contains the galaxy, in equation (35) r is assumed to be a spherical coordinate (it will be relaxed in the next subsections).\nBecause of the integral (7) cannot be solved analytically for this specific plasma model, we cannot obtain an analytical expression for the electron column density Ne. Far from being a limitation of this model, since such integral can always be solved numerically, we chose to fit a function in a suitable range in order to obtain an analytical expression for the solution of the lens equation. Then, we approximate the electron column density Ne as follows,\nNe(\u03b8) \u2248 An0rpe\u2212(\u03b8/B\u03b80) C , (36)\nwhere \u03b80 = rp/Dl, and A, B and C are dimensionless parameters that we obtain from the fitting. Note that the value of A,B and C will depend on the particular choice of rp. In Fig 2 we graphically show as an example the fitting implemented in equation (36) for this kind of plasma with parameters n0 = 60cm\n\u22123 and rp = 1kpc. We see that in the range under consideration, which corresponds to the range where we will have images (see Fig. 3), the implemented fitting is quite adequate with an error of less than 0.25%, while the fitting parameters remain as follows: A = 2.003 \u00b1 0.002, B = 1.55 \u00b1 0.01, C = 1.47\u00b1 0.01.\nThe plasma lensing potential for this model reads,\n\u03c8plasma(\u03b8, \u03c9) = Dls DsDl\n2\u03c0c2\n\u03c92(1 + zl)2 Aren0rpe\n\u2212 (\n\u03b8 B\u03b80 )C .\n(37) With the intention to simplify the expressions in the following Sections we rewrite (37) as,\n\u03c8plasma(\u03b8, \u03c9) = \u03c8 2 \u03c9e\n\u2212 (\n\u03b8 B\u03b80 )C , (38)\nwhere\n\u03c82\u03c9 = Dls DsDl\n2\u03c0c2\n\u03c92(1 + zl)2 Aren0rp. (39)\nIn order to apply the perturbative approach, we take into account the circular symmetry of the plasma potential (in contrast to the SIE gravitational potential), and therefore it will be convenient to consider the perturbation on\nthe total projected lensing potential \u03c8tot(\u03b8\u20d7) (i.e. gravitational potential + plasma potential) only due to the deviation from circularity of the gravitational potential. That is, using the notation of the previous section we set\n\u03c8tot(\u03b8\u20d7) = \u03c8grav(\u03b8\u20d7) + \u03c8plasma(\u03b8\u20d7, \u03c9), (40) \u03c80(\u03b8\u20d7) = \u03c8grav(\u03b8\u20d7)|\u03b7=0 + \u03c8plasma(\u03b8\u20d7, \u03c9) = \u03b8E \u03b8 + \u03c8plasma(\u03b8\u20d7, \u03c9) = \u03b8E \u03b8 + \u03c82\u03c9e \u2212 ( \u03b8 B\u03b80 )C , (41)\n\u03b4\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7) = \u03c8tot(\u03b8\u20d7)\u2212 \u03c80(\u03b8) = \u03b8E \u03b8( \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b7 cos 2\u03d5\u2212 1). (42)\nFinally, from (24), the perturbative solution of the lens equation can be expressed as,\n\u03b4\u03b8\u00b1 = |\u03b8\u20d7E |\n(\u221a 1\u2212 \u03b7 cos 2\u03d5\u2212 1 ) + \u03b4\u03b210 cos\u03d5+ \u03b4\u03b220 sin\u03d5\u00b1 \u221a \u2206\n1\u2212 \u03c8 2 \u03c9\n\u03b82p C\u03b6e\u2212\u03b6(1 + C(\u03b6 \u2212 1))\n, (43)\nwhere \u03b6 = ( \u03b8p B\u03b80 )C , and\n\u2206 = \u03b4\u03b22s \u2212 ( \u03b4\u03b220 cos\u03d5\u2212 \u03b4\u03b210 sin\u03d5+\n\u03b7|\u03b8\u20d7E | sin 2\u03d5\u221a 1\u2212 \u03b7 cos 2\u03d5\n)2 .\n(44)\nAs we have pointed out, image formation is character-\nized by inequality (26). From this condition we can analytically analyze, for some particular cases, the regions in the lens plane where we will have images in terms of source and lens parameters. The first thing that we can notice is that a spherical plasma profile will not have an effect on the angular position of the images since \u2206 does not depend on the observation frequency or on the elec-\n7 tronic distribution on the plasma. So the effect of the plasma in the images position will be completely in the radial direction.\nLet us first consider the case without ellipticity (\u03b7 = 0) for three different arrangements of the source position. For the case in which the source is horizontally aligned in the plane of the source, that is, for sources located along the line characterized by \u03b4\u03b210 \u0338= 0 and \u03b4\u03b220 = 0, we see from (44) that the images in the lens plane will be restricted to regions sin2 \u03d5 \u2264 (\u03b4\u03b2s/\u03b4\u03b210)2, with 0 \u2264 \u03d5 \u2264 2\u03c0. On the other hand, for vertically aligned sources, that is, for sources located along the line \u03b4\u03b210 = 0 and \u03b4\u03b220 \u0338= 0, the images will be restricted to regions where cos2 \u03d5 \u2264 (\u03b4\u03b2s/\u03b4\u03b220)2, with 0 \u2264 \u03d5 \u2264 2\u03c0. Finally, within the non-ellipticity case we can also obtain an explicit condition for the images position for sources located along the diagonal and anti-diagonal in the source plane characterized by \u03b4\u03b210 = \u00b1\u03b4\u03b220 \u0338= 0. In such case images position in the lens plane will be characterized by the condition sin2(\u03c0/4\u2213 \u03d5) \u2264 12 (\u03b4\u03b2s/\u03b4\u03b220)\n2, with 0 \u2264 \u03d5 \u2264 2\u03c0. On the other hand, we can also analyze the case where the ellipticity of the lens is extremely small (\u03b7 \u226a 1) but where the source is located at the origin of the source plane, that is, \u03b4\u03b210 = \u03b4\u03b220 = 0. In this case images formation will occur in the region of the lens plane characterized by sin2(2\u03d5) \u2264 ( \u03b4\u03b2s\u03b7\u03b8E )\n2, with 0 \u2264 \u03d5 \u2264 2\u03c0. In Fig. 3 we graphically compare the perturbative with the numerical method with this particular plasma model for the following lens configuration. We consider a gravitational lens described by the parameters: n0 = 60cm\n\u22123, rp = 1kpc, \u03c3c = 180km/s, \u03b7 = 0.3 at an observation frequency \u03bd = 80Mhz. The angular radius of the Einstein ring for this configuration is \u03b8E = 0.555arcsec (green line) while \u03b8pE = 0.517arcsec (black line). The source parameters are (radius and position): \u03b4\u03b2s = 0.06\u03b8E , \u03b4\u03b210 = 0.08\u03b8E , \u03b4\u03b220 = 0.0. As mentioned in the introduction, we assume that the lens and the source are located at zl = 0.04 and zs = 0.1, respectively. In this figure we show the solution of the lens equation for pure gravity case in red lines, while in blue lines we show the solution for the case with plasma. In this particular case we see that the plasma does not change the multiplicity of images or their morphology and, in particular, we can see that perturbative solution fully coincides with the numerical one (gray line) for a single iteration. However, we see that for this configuration, the main effect of the plasma is the shift of images position in the radial direction towards the center of the lens. It is worth mentioning that in radio frequency observations, although they are focused on certain centered observation frequencies, they typically have a bandwidth, which can result in blurred images. However, for example, the LOFAR observatory has a bandwidth of approximately 3 MHz for observations at 140 MHz or less [58], so the position and shape of the images will only change slightly. In this work, which aims to study the main effects of plasma, we will omit this kind of consideration.

Finally, it is important to point out that all numerical solutions of the lens equation as well as the numerical computation of critical and caustic curves obtained in Sec.

            "text": "Although a spherically symmetric electron distribution in the plasma allows us to show the basic effects of the plasma\u2019s influence on image formation, it may not be a sufficiently realistic model, so it is also worth studying electronic distributions that respect other symmetries. In this subsection we will consider a electron distribution with azimuthal symmetry about the z\u2032-coordinate axis. In this case it is convenient to work with cylindri-\n8 cal coordinates in such a way that the electron density in the plasma only depends explicitly on the z\u2032 and rc coordinates. Recall that the cylindrical radial coordinate rc is defined on the x\n\u2032y\u2032 plane perpendicular to the lens plane as shown in Fig. 1. We choose an exponential decay in the radial direction and we will make two different choices for the behavior of the electron density in the z\u2032 direction. Thus we will consider an electron density of the form,\nne(rc, z \u2032) = n0e \u2212rc/rpf(z\u2032), (45)\nwith rp a free parameter. This kind of models, more realistic than those spherically symmetric (see equation (35)) have also been considered in the past, obtaining several estimates for the average electron density n0 and the characteristic radius rp from the study of the ion distribution in the H II regions for various galaxies. In [60] values of n0 = 500cm\n\u22123 and rp = 8kpc were obtained for the galaxy NGC 1232, while in [49] values for n0 were estimated in the range of \u2248 [30 \u2212 260]cm\u22123, based on the study of more than 600 galaxies from the KMOS and SAMI surveys.\nIn this case the electron column density reads,\nNe(\u03b8, \u03c6) = \u222b Dls \u2212Dl ne(rc, z \u2032)dx\u2032\n= n0f(z \u2032) \u222b Dls \u2212Dl e \u2212 \u221a x\u20322+(Dl\u03b8 cos\u03c6)2 rp dx\u2032\n= n0rpf(z \u2032) \u222b Dls/rp \u2212Dl/rp e \u2212 \u221a x\u03032+( Dl rp \u03b8 cos\u03c6)2 dx\u0303,\n(46)\nwhere x\u0303 = x\u2032/rp. As this integral cannot be performed analytically we choose to approximate it by a exponential function as follows,\nNe(\u03b8, \u03c6) = n0rpf(z \u2032) ( Ae\u2212(\u03b8| cos\u03c6|/B\u03b80) C ) , (47)\nwhere \u03b80 = rp/Dl, and A,B and C are dimensionless parameters. As we have mentioned in the previous subsection these parameters depend on the particular choice of rp. Therefore the plasma potential for this profile is given by,\n\u03c8plasma(\u03b8\u20d7, \u03c9) = \u03c8 2 \u03c9e\n\u2212 (\n\u03b8| cos\u03c6| B\u03b80 )C f(z\u2032), (48)\nwhere\n\u03c82\u03c9 = Dls DsDl\n2\u03c0c2\n\u03c92(1 + zl)2 Aren0rp. (49)\nUnlike of the case considered in the previous subsection, the resulting plasma potential is not circularly symmetric. Therefore, unlike the spherically symmetric model we described above, in this case the plasma potential acts as a perturbation in the lens equation. In such a way that the solution of the zero-order lens equation \u03b8p given by 16 will coincide with the radius of Einstein\u2019s ring, that is, \u03b8p = \u03b8E . Therefore, we have the following expressions for the umperturbed and perturbed potentials (considering again the SIE gravitational potential as a model of the dark matter halo):\n\u03c8tot(\u03b8\u20d7) = \u03c8grav(\u03b8\u20d7) + \u03c8plasma(\u03b8\u20d7, \u03c9), (50)\n\u03c80(\u03b8\u20d7) = \u03c8grav(\u03b8\u20d7)|\u03b7=0 = \u03b8E \u03b8, (51) \u03b4\u03c8(\u03b8\u20d7) = \u03c8tot(\u03b8\u20d7)\u2212 \u03c80(\u03b8) = \u03b8E \u03b8( \u221a 1\u2212 \u03b7 cos 2\u03d5\u2212 1) + \u03c8plasma(\u03b8\u20d7, \u03c9). (52)\nFinally, we will choose two different kinds of decay along the z\u2032-direction, for both positive and negative values of this coordinate. First an exponential decay and then a Gaussian one. In both cases the idea is to simulate that the electrons are mostly distributed along the x\u2032y\u2032 plane, that is, the decay in the z direction must be faster than along the xy plane. As we did in the previous case, in order to describe the images in the lens plane, we will express the lens potential in terms of the coordinates b = Dl\u03b8 and \u03c6 fitted to the plane of the lens."

Although in this case an analytical study can also be carried out on the images position for different locations of the source as we did for the spherical model, the expressions that result from such analysis do not provide as much clarity as in the previous case and for this reason we decided directly face a graphic analysis of the images. What we can say from the analytical solution is that, unlike the spherically symmetric case, the effect of the plasma in the images will occur not only in the radial direction but also in its angular position, since in this case the function \u2206 depends on the plasma parameters.\nIn Figure 4 we consider as an example a circular source with radius \u03b4\u03b2s = 0.06\u03b8E centered at \u03b4\u03b210 = 0.08\u03b8E , \u03b4\u03b220 = 0.0, and parameters n0 = 10cm\n\u22123, rp = 10kpc, z0 = 1kpc, \u03c3c = 180km/s , \u03b7 = 0.3, \u03b8E = 0.555arcsec (green line). The fitting parameters are given by A = 2.00004\u00b10.00002, B = 1.16\u00b10.01, C = 1.719\u00b10.006. In blue lines we see the solution of the lens equation for the case of pure gravity while in red we plot the perturbative solution with plasma and compare it with the numerical integration of the lens equation (gray line) in order to corroborate the accuracy of the perturbative approach.\nIn this case we plot the images for three different observation frequencies, from left to right: 350Mhz, 170Mhz and 80Mhz. For the higher frequency that we are considering the plasma effect is hardly distinguishable from pure gravity case which is the expected behaviour. For a frequency lower than 170Mhz, we see that the images that are further away from the horizontal axis, which coincides with the z = 0 axis in the lens plane, tend to get closer to the center of the lens, a change is also seen in the angular position of the images with respect to the case\nof pure gravity. On the other hand, we see that the images close to the horizontal axis, which in turn coincides with the plasma disk, tend to separate, forming for low frequencies four images instead of the two that appeared in the gravity pure case. This is because of due to the divergent property of the plasma lensing, some rays of light deviate above and others below the horizontal axis. These facts are evidenced in the last plot for a frequency of 80Mhz, showing in this case that plasma can not only interfere with the morphology of the images but also with their multiplicity.\nFinally, we point out that these plots were obtained with a single iteration of our method and in comparison with the numerical solution we see that the method is quite accurate at least for this studied configuration, although as it can be seen, it is less accurate for lower and lower frequencies."

(60)\nWe see again that the plasma will have effects on both the radial and angular position of the images in the lens plane since \u2206 also depends on the parameters of the plasma.\nIn Figure 5 we consider as an example a circular source with radius \u03b4\u03b2s = 0.06\u03b8E centered at \u03b4\u03b210 = 0.08\u03b8E , \u03b4\u03b220 = 0.0, and parameters n0 = 40cm\n\u22123, rp = 10kpc, z0 = 1kpc, \u03c3c = 180km/s , \u03b7 = 0.3, \u03b8E = 0.730arcsec (green line).

In blue lines we see the solution of the lens equation for pure gravity case while in red we plot the perturbative solution with plasma and compare it with the numerical integration of the lens equation (gray line) in order to corroborate the accuracy of the method.\nIn this case we plot the images for four different observation frequencies, from left to right: 320Mhz, 170Mhz, 140Mhz, 130Mhz. Again for high frequencies the effect of the plasma is quite weak. Although as we go to lower and lower observation frequencies we see a similar situation with the previous model. The images that are close to the horizontal axis z\u2032 = 0 begin to separate but this time in three images each of them, while the two images that are further from the axis z\u2032 = 0 remain practically unchanged with respect to the pure gravity case because, for this particular model, the decay along the z\u2032 direction\nis much faster than in the previous model and therefore the influence of the plasma in these images is very slight. It is also for this reason that the perturbative solution resolves these images quite well and not so well those close to the z\u2032 = 0 axis. In particular, we see that for the observation frequency of 130Mhz, the perturbative solution would need at least another iteration to be able to reproduce the images properly. The effect produced by the plasma in the multiplicity of images is closely related to the effect produced by the plasma on the structure of caustic curves, and therefore also on the structure of critical curves. In section V we will study the effect of plasma on these kinds of curves, thus showing what causes this doubling in the images produced by plasma."

For this reason, in the remainder of the article we will not mention this profile because any analysis that we could carry out is somehow contained in the analysis carried out for the spherically symmetric density profile given by (35) .\nLastly, the effect that a plasma disk like the one we are considering, for an arbitrary orientation with respect to the line of sight, has on image formation was recently discussed and can be consulted in [61, 62]."

            "text": "Because this is a perturbative method, it is expected that for some situations the solutions obtained through it are too far from the exact solutions. In this Section we will call exact solutions to those obtained numerically since we can obtain them with a high degree of precision, even though they are not strictly so. This situation where the perturbative method is not precise enough can be reached in various circumstances, either because the ellipticity of the lens is very high or because the source is centered too far from the line of sight or its radius is too large. Or a combination of them. These situations have been studied both in Alard\u2019s original work and in subsequent works [39, 47, 63].\nOn the other hand, the plasma will also influence the accuracy of the perturbative method, since for plasma potentials without spherical symmetry it will intervene as a perturbation of the lens potential in pure gravity, such\n12\nis the case, for example, of the plasma disk seen from side that we analyzed in the previous section. But also the spherically symmetric plasma potentials will have an effect on the accuracy of the method since, as we can see, the first order solution given by (24) must be evaluated in \u03b8p which corresponds with the zero order solution of the lens equation that is affected by the plasma. Obviously, the influence of the plasma on the accuracy of the perturbative method will be greater as the electron density increases as well as for lower and lower observation frequencies.\nAs we have seen, in Sec. II B we introduced an iterative correction of the perturbative method in order to address those situations where the perturbative method (with a single iteration) is not accurate enough to reproduce the exact solutions.\nIn Fig. 6 we return to the spherical plasma model for the following configuration: \u03bd = 80Mhz, n0 = 300cm\n\u22123, rp = 1kpc, \u03c3c = 180km/s, \u03b7 = 0.3, \u03b8E = 0.555arcsec (green line), \u03b8pE = 0.381arcsec (black line). Source parameters (radius and position where it is centered): \u03b4\u03b2s = 0.06\u03b8E , \u03b4\u03b210 = 0.5\u03b8E , \u03b4\u03b220 = 0.0. The fitting parameters are: A = 2.003 \u00b1 0.002, B = 1.55 \u00b1 0.01, C = 1.47 \u00b1 0.01. In this figure we see the images formation for the first three iterations of the perturbative method. In gray is the exact solution (or numerical solution itself). Both for the case of pure gravity (blue lines) and for the case with plasma (red lines) we see that two images are formed: on the right a gravitational arc that is a tangential deformation of the solution to order zero, and on the left side a radially deformed image, which we enlarged for better visualization. The corrections introduced by the second and third iterations are clearly evident in the enlarged region where we see how the accuracy of the perturbative method improves substantially, while the correction in the gravitational arc does not seem to change much to the naked eye. In this case the effect of the plasma is relevant in the accuracy of the method both because we are working with a relatively low observation frequency of 80Mhz and also because we are considering a relatively high electron density of 300cm\u22121 in comparison with the cases that we have been analyzing up to now.\nOn the other hand, we also analyze the iterative corrections of the perturbative method for the plasma disk seen from the side with Gaussian decay in the z direction. In this case we repeat the same configuration of parameters that we used in Fig. 5 and in particular we are going to concentrate on the last two subfigures on the right that correspond to observation frequencies of 140Mhz and 130Mhz, respectively. In both cases we will see how a third iteration of the perturbative method produces significant corrections of the perturbative method. These corrections can be seen in Fig. 7 for the 140Mhz frequency, and Fig. 8 for the 130Mhz frequency. Higher\norder iterations do not show significant corrections. In this way we graphically show for some particular examples how the iterative corrections of the perturbative method are useful to reproduce the position of the images more faithfully. We highlight that in all cases corrections of order four or higher were not necessary. On the other hand, although it is possible to show how the analytical solutions are for the different iterations, these expressions are quite cumbersome and lack any illustrative character, and for this reason we decided to carry out only a graphical analysis of them."

            "heading": "V. CRITICAL AND CAUSTIC CURVES",
            "text": "As we saw in Sec. III, for certain plasma profiles, in particular for a plasma disk seen from the side with both exponential and Gaussian decay in perpendicular direction to the disk, the plasma has a clear effect on the multiplicity of images (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). Far from being the goal of this section to establish a general criterion or necessary conditions that allow us to predict the number of images given a certain plasma profile, we are going to analyze the effect of plasma on the critical and caustic curves associated with Fig. 5, which corresponds to the model with Gaussian decay in the z direction. The plasma will have a similar effect on the critical and caustic curves associated with Fig. 4 although in this case, since the lens potential is not differentiable at z = 0, they must be carefully calculated near this area. The critical curves, which are those curves defined from the condition J = 0 in the lens plane, where J = det\u2202\u03b2\u20d7 \u2202\u03b8\u20d7 is the determinant of the Jacobian matrix, are of significant importance because they are related to some of the most notorious effects of gravitational lensing theory: image magnification and multiplicity of them (the latter, characteristic of strong gravitational lenses). Due to the magnification effect, the image of an infinitesimally\nsmall source located at position \u03b8\u20d7 will magnify by a factor |\u00b5(\u03b8\u20d7)| where \u00b5 is known as magnification (or point magnification to be precise) and is defined by \u00b5 = 1J . In this way, we see that the critical curves are those regions in the lens plane where the magnification of the images is infinite. This divergence indicates that the geometric optics approach fails in this region. However, when dealing in practice with extended sources, the magnification is calculated by averaging the point magnification on the source and, in turn, weighing it and normalizing it by its surface brightness. For a detailed discussion of this topic we refer to [2]. Let\u2019s assume, for example, that we have a spherical gravitational potential \u03c80 and a small perturbation \u03b4\u03c8 associated with the plasma medium. In this situation, in the perturbative approach, using (17) we have\nJ = 1\n\u03b8\n[[ 1\u2212 \u2202 2(\u03c80 + \u03b4\u03c8)\n\u2202\u03b82\n][ \u03b8 \u2212 \u2202(\u03c80 + \u03b4\u03c8)\n\u2202\u03b8 \u2212 1 \u03b8\n\u22022(\u03c80 + \u03b4\u03c8)\n\u2202\u03d52 ] \u22121 \u03b8 [1 \u03b8 \u2202(\u03c80 + \u03b4\u03c8) \u2202\u03d5 \u2212 \u2202 2(\u03c80 + \u03b4\u03c8) \u2202\u03b8\u2202\u03d5 ]2]\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b8=\u03b8E+\u03b4\u03b8 .\n(67)\nBy doing a linear approximation in \u03b4\u03b8 and \u03b4\u03c8 and using\n\u2202\u03c80 \u2202\u03b8 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b8=\u03b8E = \u03b8E , (68)\n\u2202\u03c80 \u2202\u03d5 = 0 , (69)\n1\n\u03b8 + \u03b4\u03b8 =\n1 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b8 \u03b82 +O(\u03b4\u03b82) , (70)\nwe finally obtain\nJ = 1\n\u03b8\n[ 1\u2212 \u2202\n2\u03c80 \u2202\u03b82\n] [ \u03b4\u03b8 ( 1\u2212 \u2202\n2\u03c80 \u2202\u03b82\n) \u2212 \u2202\u03b4\u03c8\n\u2202\u03b8 \u2212 1 \u03b8\n\u22022\u03b4\u03c8\n\u2202\u03d52 ]\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b8=\u03b8E .\n(71)\n14\nFrom this relation it follows that if we consider that the plasma effect introduced in \u03b4\u03c8 has circular symmetry, the images can be demagnified with respect to the gravitational magnification for over-dense plasma regions (where \u2202\u03b4\u03c8 \u2202\u03b8 < 0). This case was analyzed in [36], finding that the ratio between the magnifications of different images does not change too much with respect to the case of considering only gravity, concluding therefore that the existence of plasma cannot account for the flux ratio anomaly. The opposite effect is produced in under density regions. We refer to [24, 38, 64, 65] for different situations that can be presented (see also [61] for a numerical study of the relative magnification between the different images). However, for non circular perturbative potentials, the effect of the plasma medium on the magnification of images could have a completely different behavior, depending strongly on the angular dependence in both \u03b8 and \u03d5 of the projected potential \u03b4\u03c8. Note also that from the expression for the jacobian J , one infers that generically the total magnification is nonlinear. Therefore, in those cases, we cannot assign plasma and gravitational magnification values to each of the individual images.\nIn the following, instead of calculating the critical curves through the approximate formula eq.(71) of J , we will show the graphs through numerical calculations without extra approximations.\nIn Fig. 9 we see the critical curves associated with Fig. 5 for various observation frequencies. In green we\nplot the Einstein ring while in blue and red the critical curves for the pure gravity case and for the case with plasma, respectively. We can see that even for frequencies of 320MHz, the influence of the plasma is notorious and that its main influence, at least in this profile that we are considering, occurs along the horizontal axis defined by z = 0 in the lens plane, because it coincides with the plasma disc seen from the side. Although such curves could also be obtained from a perturbative approach, we decided to numerically study both the critical and caustic curves in order to avoid any bias that a perturbative solution might introduce.\nOn the other hand, as we previously mentioned, the critical curves are also related to the multiplicity of images, although in an indirect way since the evaluation of the lens equation along these curves gives us what is known as caustic curves, and the relative position of the source with respect to these new curves is what will give us information about the multiplicity of the images. In other words, those sources that generate images located along critical curves in the lens plane are located along caustic curves in the source plane. A simple example of this is given in the case of an spherically symmetric lens and a point source, the latter aligned with the line of sight. The image produced in this case is an Einstein ring which in turn coincides with a critical curve, and therefore the caustic curve will be in this case the point where the source is located.\nIn Fig. 10 we can see the caustic curves associated with Fig. 5. In blue we see the caustic curves for the pure gravity case in the form of an astroid while in red the caustic curves for the case with plasma are shown for different observation frequencies. In black we can see the relative position of the source with respect to these curves. The effect that the plasma has for lower frequencies is notable, which is correlated with the images that are formed in the lens plane. For an observation frequency of 320Mhz we see that although the effect of the plasma on the caustic curves is appreciable, the images change very little because the source is relatively far from them. However, for lower and lower frequencies we see substantial effects in the images formed along the axis z = 0 in the lens plane, a situation that is consistent with an increasing approximation between the source and the caustic curves. For an observation frequency of 130Mhz we can even see that the plasma produces a change in the multiplicity of the images that is perfectly distinguishable, coinciding with an overlap between the source and the caustic curves in multiple places. In particular, at a frequency of 130MHz, the source is located within the left-hand cusp, which appears near the center, without having fully entered the interior of the right-hand cusp nearby. This explains why the image inside the Einstein ring is split into three images on the positive abscissa axis in the rightmost figure of Fig. 5, in accordance with the general theory of image formation near caustic curves (see [66] and references therein). However, the same is not observed in the image on the left, which still retains the shape of an elongated\n15\narc (also in agreement with the general theory). It should be noted that, since we are dealing with singular gravitational potentials, the odd number images theorem does not apply to the situations studied here. Finally, in Fig. 11 we see simultaneously the images that are formed (sub-figure below) for different relative positions of the source with respect to the caustic curves (sub-figure above). In this way, it is possible to better appreciate the importance of caustic curves in the morphology and multiplicity of images in the lens plane."

            "text": "It is our main interest in this section to put in perspective the two dimensional simple lens models discussed previously by comparing them with enhanced models coming from a volumetric distributions. There are a couple reasons that motivate this further analysis, let us mention for example that even though these 2D models are useful for fitting and quantifying many astrophysical systems it is often the case that spheroidal symmetric distributions do not project to surface mass densities with ellipsoidal symmetry; as in the case of SIEs. Another usual feature of elliptical models is that they are based on two dimensional isodensity or equipotential curves with ellipses having the same eccentricity, instead in some case it could be desirable to have at hand models that tends to be spherically symmetric in the limit or large distance from the center of the distribution; this is not the case for the models previously studied. For instance, the spheroidal symmetries appear naturally when one considers generalized mass distribution in Newtonian gravity which leads for example to the so-called third Newton theorem [67]. Below we present the description of static and spheroidal lenses with an approach that has some differences with respect to the usual treatments. Here, we will prefer to deal with a geometrical model describing the spacetime associated to the lens and built an spheroidal symmetric model based on the standard oblate spheroidal coordinates[68], where the spheroids of symmetry are confocal; this means that when the radial coordinate associated to spheroids growth its eccentricity \u03f5 decreases. So, below we present a geometry that has oblate symmetry and becomes a direct generalization of the well known singular isothermal profile in spherical symmetry to the spheroidal case. The model is determined by the metric\nds2 =\n( r\nr0\n)4\u03c32 dt2 \u2212 ( \u03a3\nr2 + r2\u00b5 +\n2M(r)\nr\n) dr2\n\u2212 \u03a3d\u03b82 \u2212 ( r2 + r2\u00b5 ) sin2(\u03b8)d\u03d52;\n(72)\nwhere\nM(r) = 2\u03c32r, (73)\nand r0 and r\u00b5 are fixed parameters. Note that \u03c3 here does not have any unit (\u03c3 \u2261 \u03c3c/c). If r\u00b5 = 0 the spacetime becomes spherically symmetric and would have a mass-\nenergy density of isothermal form given by\n\u03c1sphe(r) = 1 2\u03c0r2 \u03c32 1 + 4\u03c32 \u2243 \u03c3 2 2\u03c0r2 ; (74)\nwhile its spacelike matter components would be Pr(r) = 0 and P\u03b8(r) = \u03c3\n2\u03c1sphe(r) (and so P\u03b8(r) \u226a \u03c1sphe(r) since typically \u03c32 \u226a 1). That is, when r\u00b5 = 0 the above metric is a peculiar singular isothermal profile; its massenergy density is only determined by the mass function M(r) while the timelike component of the metric ensures a model with negligible pressures and vanishing stresses. The behaviour of the solution in the limit r\u00b5 = 0 was in fact one of the criteria adopted to find the line element (72) since in this case, this lens will display similar phenomenology than the spherical analogues of the SIE model of the previous sections. Instead, if \u03c3 = 0 one obtains the flat line element in the standard oblate spheroidal coordinates. The eccentricity of the oblate spheroids of r =constant is given by \u03f52 = r2\u00b5\nr2+r2\u00b5 . As we previously mentioned, this becomes a\nsubtle difference with respect to the SIE model where the ellipses of symmetry have a constant eccentricity, namely\n17\n\u03f52 SIE = 2\u03b71+\u03b7 =constant.\nThen, in order to compare both models a suitable choice of the parameter r\u00b5 has to be made to fit a SIE characterized by \u03b7=constant. For r\u00b5 \u0338= 0, the model presented in this section is a kind of natural generalization to oblate spheroidal symmetry of the singular isothermal profile, in particular it is interesting to note that even the stresses given by the component Tr\u03b8 of the energy momentum tensor are present, they become negligible.\nThe following sections show the behaviour of this lensing in both weak and strong regimes when a plasma is present or absent."

For example, one could try to fit critical curves of one model to the other or to associate the elliptical shape of the SIE potential with an appropriated projected ellipsoids among others possibilities. For this study we combine this two criteria to fit\nsimilarities between features of both models.

The search of the angular directions that corresponds to points comprising caustic curves or the points corresponding to the source is implemented through iterative approximations. In the sky of the observer one starts with two initial guesses taken along a radial direction in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight and in a next step we run the mid-point algorithm to correct the initial geodesics to the closer ones to the specified target, the position of the source or the criteria that the geodesic reach a divergence beyond certain threshold.

In order to visualize large distortions like arcs we also placed a circular source at (\u03b2x, \u03b2z) = (0.2\u03b8E , 0)arcsec, with radius rsource of size rsource = 0.1arcsec. The results in are shown in Figs. 15 and 16 for the case of pure gravity. It is observed in the former one, the formation of large arcs at both side of the source; one of them lies outside of the region delimited by the critical curve while the other is inside. The presence of two arcs is associated with the fact that the source intersect the caustic; this can be appreciated in Fig. 16 where it is shown the appearance of the critical curve and the caustic giving origin to it. It is worthwhile to mention that such behaviour is in full agreement with the expected images that one would obtain with the well known 2D models.\nWe also consider for completeness, the model of section (VIB 4) having r\u00b5 = 0.7rE . The images corresponding to the circular source considered in this section are shown in Fig. 18 and its position with respect to the caustic (diamond shape) is shown in Fig. 17.

Two notable changes are observed in this case with respect to the previous one: the presence of four images with arc shapes that appear closer to the center than those of the pure gravity case, and the shrink of the critical curve. As clearly notice from Fig. 18, the cause explaining the number of images should be ascribed to the position of the source in the interior of the caustic region, in agreement with similar results with 2D models. Finally, it is perhaps interesting to note that the shape of the critical curve in the pure gravity case fit very well the critical curve of figure 14 despite both were computed with different methods.\n22"

            "text": "In the first part of this work, after a generalization of the Alard perturbative approach to solve the lens equations and making use of simple models for the ISM plasma around galaxies, we have shown how to include its effects on the photon propagation in the radio-frequency band to study the formation of lensed images in the strong lensing regime in an analytical perturbative way. We have described the position, shape and number of images for circular sources which are lensed by galaxies in two simple orientations, frontal and edge view. More general orientations are discussed in [61, 62]. For the particular cases of plasma profiles that we have used, we have shown how the number of images can increase as the observation frequency approaches the characteristic frequency of the plasma, resulting in the number of images being sensitive to the plasma profile and to the position of the source in the region of the caustic curve. Of course, in a real galaxy, the electronic distribution of plasma in the interstellar medium should be much more complex than in the models studied here. More sophisticated models should include the plasma concentration along arms in spiral galaxies, the bulk, disk, and also the plasma environment around satellite galaxies, etc. As previously discussed, this kind of models already exist in the literature [48\u201354, 74]. However, the simple models studied here, allow us to give an idea of what kind of situations one could find when analyzing lensed systems in the low radio frequency regime, such as those expected to be observed in LOFAR+nenuFAR observatory [74, 75]. It is worth noting that subarcsecond-resolution observations of bright radio sources, even at 30 MHz, have recently become possible thanks to the LOFAR observatory[76].\nAdditionaly, not only the position of the images will be affected by the presence of the plasma, but also the time delay between them, which in addition to the well-known geometric and Shapiro effects will now also depend on the plasma medium, which affects the group velocity of propagation of electromagnetic waves[24, 36, 61, 77]. These and other studies will be developed in future works. An interesting question is how to reconstruct the lensing properties from image observations when a gravity + plasma environment is taken into account. In such situations, parameters associated with the plasma potential model must be added to those associated with the gravitational potential. In cases where gravitational lensing can be observed in the optical regime (or where plasma effects are negligible), the gravitational potential can be separately reconstructed using conventional techniques (see, for example, [78] and references therein). However, if the source is variable, estimates of the dispersion measurement and plasma potential can be obtained by studying variations in the time delay between different images, which is chromatically dependent on the presence of plasma[79]. In cases where differences in the arrival time of signals from the images cannot be measured, the procedure becomes more complicated, but it can still be performed if the lensed system can be observed at three nearby frequencies. For more details on this method, interested readers are referred to Wagner and Er[79]. Additionally, with the intention to further study more general models for the lens distribution, we have also introduced a full geometrical model which is a natural generalization of spherically symmetric lenses with a singular isothermal profile. The metric proposed in this case resemble a disc-like oblate geometry that far from the center approaches to a spherically symmetric one. Despite the differences between this kind of models and those of section III that do not allow for a direct comparison, we have shown that a reasonable fitting criteria can be attempted in order to study some qualitative features appearing in both lens models; such as the shape of critical curves and the observed number of images that are obtained depending on the position of source with respect to caustics. While two-dimensional models are certainly useful for studying these types of problems, it is important to note that our consideration of the three-dimensional spheroidal model represents a significant step toward constructing more realistic models. Furthermore, in Section (VIB), we have taken into account the influence of the cosmological framework on these systems, further reinforcing the realism of our models. A further analysis on the properties of these kind of model will be presented elsewhere."
