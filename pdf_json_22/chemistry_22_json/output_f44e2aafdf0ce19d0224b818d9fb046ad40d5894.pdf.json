    "abstractText": "Curvuluria lunata is a melanized fungus pathogenic to both plants and animals including humans, causing frommild, febrile to life-threatening illness if not well treated. In humans, it is an etiological agent of keratomycosis, sinusitis, and onychomycosis in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. The development of multiple-drug-resistant strains poses a critical treatment issue as well as public health problem. Natural products are attractive prototypes for drug discovery due to their broad-spectrum efficacy and lower side effects. The present study explores possible targets of natural antifungal compounds (\u03b1pinene, eugenol, berberine, and curcumin) againstC. lunata via gene expression analysis, molecular docking interaction, and molecular dynamics (MD) studies. Curcumin, berberine, eugenol, and \u03b1-pinene exhibited in vitro antifungal activity at 78 \u03bcg/ml, 156 \u03bcg/ml, 156 \u03bcg/ml, and 1250 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. In addition, treatment by these compounds led to the complete inhibition of conidial germination and hindered the adherence when observed on onion epidermis. Several pathogenic factors of fungi are crucial for their survival inside the host including those involved in melanin biosynthesis, hyphal growth, sporulation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling. Relative gene expression of velB, brn1, clm1, and pks18 responsible for conidiation, melanin, and cell wall integrity was down-regulated significantly. Results of molecular docking possessed good binding affinity of compounds and have confirmed their potential targets as THR and VelB proteins. The docked structures, having good binding affinity among all, were further refined, and rescored from their docked poses through 100-ns long MD OPEN ACCESS",

In humans, it is an etiological agent of keratomycosis, sinusitis, and onychomycosis in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. The development of multiple-drug-resistant strains poses a critical treatment issue as well as public health problem. Natural products are attractive prototypes for drug discovery due to their broad-spectrum efficacy and lower side effects. The present study explores possible targets of natural antifungal compounds (\u03b1pinene, eugenol, berberine, and curcumin) againstC. lunata via gene expression analysis, molecular docking interaction, and molecular dynamics (MD) studies. Curcumin, berberine, eugenol, and \u03b1-pinene exhibited in vitro antifungal activity at 78 \u03bcg/ml, 156 \u03bcg/ml, 156 \u03bcg/ml, and 1250 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. In addition, treatment by these compounds led to the complete inhibition of conidial germination and hindered the adherence when observed on onion epidermis. Several pathogenic factors of fungi are crucial for their survival inside the host including those involved in melanin biosynthesis, hyphal growth, sporulation, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling. Relative gene expression of velB, brn1, clm1, and pks18 responsible for conidiation, melanin, and cell wall integrity was down-regulated significantly. Results of molecular docking possessed good binding affinity of compounds and have confirmed their potential targets as THR and VelB proteins. The docked structures, having good binding affinity among all, were further refined, and rescored from their docked poses through 100-ns long MD"

            "text": "The Curvularia genus is one of the major groups of opportunistic human pathogenic dematiaceous filamentous fungi (Alex et al., 2013). Within the genus, Curvularia lunata (teleomorph sexual state\u2014Cochliobolus lunatus) is in the growing list of emerging fungal pathogens in humans (Giri et al., 2011; Chowdhary et al., 2014), whereas it is reported pathogenic to animals and plants (Beckett et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2017; Bisht et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). The infections caused by Curvularia spp. include phaeohyphomycosis, nondermatophytic onychomycosis, mycetoma, and infections in eyes, nails, sinuses, and wounds (Vineetha et al., 2016). Infections generally occur through direct inoculation of conidia or by inhalation, leaving it susceptible for invasion (Shrivastava et al., 2017). Patients with peritoneal, venous catheters, intravenous drug abusers, and cataract surgery patients are more prone to C. lunata infections (Alex et al., 2013).\nAzoles (itraconazole and voriconazole) and polyenes (amphotericin B) are antifungals that have widely been used to control invasive human fungal infections for more than 4 decades (J\u00f8rgensen and Heick, 2021; Uma Maheshwari Nallal et al., 2021). The clinical use of azoles is of high priority since there are only a few available alternatives for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of C. lunata infections (Chowdhary et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2019). C. lunata infections like foliar disease and leaf blight have been reported in plants (Liu et al., 2014; Garcia-Aroca et al., 2018), and to control these infections, a variety of fungicides were used in the crop fields. Excessive use of synthetic fungicides poses selective pressure on cross-kingdom pathogens and impacts antifungal drug resistance (Hof, 2001). Transferability of such drug-resistant isolates from farms to humans through the human\u2013plant interaction stances a critical public health concern (Bengyella et al., 2017) as some of the azole fungicides possess chemical structures similar to medical azole (Snelders et al., 2012).\nNatural compounds have received a renewed interest in their use as antimicrobials because of uncontrolled usage of synthetic drugs or fungicides (Nagoor Meeran et al., 2017). These can be exploited in controlling the growth of fungi consequently inhibiting secondary metabolite production. The effect of plant extracts has been investigated on C. lunata depicting alteration in growth, sporulation, and secondary metabolite\npathways (Ghany TM et al., 2015). Many investigations resulted in the screening of a wide variety of plant species/ bioactive compounds for their antimicrobial activities and have revealed structurally unique biologically active compounds (Matasyoh et al., 2007). Their target identification can be approached via direct biochemical assays, molecular studies, or using computational methods. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of compounds can be generated by studying gene expression data in the presence or absence of it.\nThe pathogenicity of C. lunata involves a plethora of virulence factors including melanin pigment (Xu et al., 2007), siderophores (Wang et al., 2013), hydrophobins, and non-host-specific toxins (Gao et al., 2012). A number of genes and proteins are involved in these pathways including brn1, clpks18, clvelB, and clm1 which are involved in melanin biosynthesis, hyphal growth, sporulation, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, and cell wall integrity (Ri\u017ener and Wheeler, 2003; Gao et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2022). Melanin deposition in the cell wall of fungus protects it from host macrophage attack and phagolysosome oxidative burst of neutrophiles (Ri\u017ener and Wheeler, 2003; T\u00f3th et al., 2020). Multiple genes are involved in the melanin production pathway of the fungus directly or indirectly, including clpks18 gene responsible for the synthesis of polyketide synthase enzyme (PKS) and brn1 gene responsible for mechanical strength of appressorium required for penetration (Ri\u017ener and Wheeler, 2003). Trihydroxynaphthalene reductase (THR) is also an essential enzyme other than PKS of the DHN melanin biosynthesis pathway, and it represents an emerging target for the development of antimycotics. Secondary metabolite synthesis of this pathogen is regulated by genes involved in velvet protein biosynthesis (Gao et al., 2017), and the velvet-like B protein VelB plays a crucial role in controlling the production of conidia, cell wall composition, integrity, and host-specific methyl 5-(hydroxymethyl) furan-2-carboxylate toxin production. Studies have also reported involvement of VelB in pathogenicity as well as fungicide resistance in C. lunata (Wu et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2017).\nThe present study focuses on the identification of the potential virulence target of C. lunata via gene expression analysis, in silico approach, and in vitro evaluation of antifungal activity of natural bioactive compounds like \u03b1pinene, eugenol, berberine, and curcumin.\nFrontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin.org02"

The extracted melanin was resuspended in 100 mM borate buffer, and absorbance was recorded in the wavelength range (250\u2013800 nm) on a UVvisible spectrophotometer. Also, 100 mM borate buffer was used as a blank. The experiment was conducted in triplicate. 2) Conidial cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) and\nconidiation: Using two-phase partitioning with hexadecane as the hydrocarbon phase, hydrophobicity assay was conducted (Pihet et al., 2009; Hoda et al., 2020).

The details of primers are given in Table 1.\nThe expression of the genes of interest was quantified by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Gupta et al., 2019, 2022). Mycelial cultures were harvested, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol\u2122 reagent (Invitrogen). A measure of 2 \u03bcg of total RNA of each sample (treated and untreated) was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA by the oligo (dT)18 primer using the Hi-cDNA Synthesis Kit (HiMedia). The qRT-PCR was performed using an ABI QuantStudio 3 system (Applied Biosystems, Streetsville, Canada), and amplification products were detected with SYBR Green Master Mix (G-Biosciences) for gene expression.\nThe relative quantification of individual gene expression was performed using the comparative threshold cycle method.

To obtain the 3D structure of proteins, homology modelling was performed using SwissModel via the ExPaSy web server (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/). The Self-Optimized Prediction Method with Alignment (SOPMA) server was used to speculate the secondary structure of VelB and THR proteins (https://npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat. pl?page=/NPSA/npsa_sopma.html). The best template having maximum percentage identity with the target and modelled structure was then evaluated via PROCHECK. For model protein preparation such as charge assignment, solvation parameters, and fragmental volumes, SwissPdbViewer version 4.10 (SPBDV-4.10) was used (Morris et al., 2009). The 3D structures of the compounds (\u03b1pinene, curcumin, berberine, and eugenol) were downloaded from the PubChem compound database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4702940/) in the spatial data file (SDF) format. The PubChem compound identifier (CID) was 969516 (curcumin), 2353 (berberine), 3314 (eugenol), and 6654 (\u03b1-pinene). The SDF file format was further converted to the PDB file format using the Open Babel tool (https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/ Installation/install.html) for molecular docking via the AutoDock4.2.3 tool (O\u2019Boyle et al., 2011). The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity profiles of plant-derived compounds were qualitatively measured by using the online SwissADME program (http://www. swissadme.ch/index.php) (Sharma et al., 2022).\nMolecular docking was performed using the AutoDock4.2.3 tool (Morris et al., 2009; Karthika et al., 2021) to predict the binding and the structure of the intermolecular complex between drug targets and potential inhibitors. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was utilized for protein\u2013ligand interactions with the set parameters. The total number of poses was set to 50. Poses were further clustered using all atom root mean square deviation (RMSD) cutoff of 0.3 \u00c5 to remove redundancy. The default values were used for all other parameters for docking and scoring. The protein\nstructure was kept rigid in all steps. The molecular interactions of the best docking pose were visualised via Discovery Studio Visualizer programs (http://accelrys.com/products/collaborativescience/biovia-discovery-studio/visualization-download.php). The amino acid residues that displayed interactions with the ligand are documented in Table 2 and Table 3.\nAll-atommolecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to understand the conformational stability of VelB and THR proteins boundwith the dockedmolecules in comparison to the unbound state of proteins. Atomic coordinates of VelB and THR protein complexes with dockedmolecules were used to generate the simulation trajectory using GROMACS v5.1.4 (Abraham et al., 2015). During the simulation complex preparation stage, the CHARMM27 (Bjelkmar et al., 2010) force field was used for proteins, while the TIP3P water model was used to solvate the protein complex. The bound ligand parameters were generated as described in the literature (Zoete et al., 2011). The protein complex was placed in the centre of the cubical box with 10\u00c5 edge-side filledwithwatermolecules. The total charge of the simulation box was neutralised by adding 0.15M counterions (Na+Cl\u2212). All the MD simulations were performed under physiological conditions (Joung and Cheatham, 2008). The prepared simulation box was taken for energy minimization using steepest descent followed by conjugant gradients (50,000 steps for each). The system was further equilibrated through the constant number, volume, and temperature (NVT) and the constant number, pressure, and temperature (NPT) for 500 ps. The Berendsen thermostat (Berendsen et al., 1987) and the Parrinello\u2013Rahman pressure (Parrinello and Rahman, 1980) algorithm were used to maintain the temperature and pressure, respectively. Final MD simulation was performed for 100 ns under the NPT ensemble condition with the step size of 0.2 fs. GROMACS modules and MD trajectory (McGibbon et al., 2015; Sankar et al., 2021) were employed to visualize the global structural order parameters: RMSD, radius of gyration (RoG), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF)."

Apart from the protein structure-level dynamics, the protein residue-level dynamics was attained by RMSF analysis (Figure 8C) which depicted that in the presence of an inhibitor, binding site residues 114 and 200\u2013220 have less fluctuation and therefore stabilize the complex.\nIn the case of the VelB complex, structural order parameter analysis with respect to the VelB receptor showed that RMSD distribution showed a more zigzag pattern for receptor protein with the mean RMSD value of 12.81 A, while the bound complex attained more stability in the presence of an inhibitor (Figure 9A). RoG (Figure 9D) and SASA analyses (Figure 9B) further explained the stability of the bound complex along the simulation. SASA achieved the plateau after 25 ns, while SASA for the unbound state receptor was still declining. Residue-level RMSF analysis also displayed that binding site residues 110\u2013135 restricted the local fluctuation, thereby increasing the stability of the complex (Figure 9C). Curcumin binding stability at the binding site of respective proteins was further computed and analysed by monitoring the average distance between centre mean position of curcumin and selected binding site residues as shown in Supplementary Figure S3 for the THR\u2013curcumin complex and Supplementary Figure S4 for the VelB\u2013curcumin\ncomplex. In case of the THR complex, binding site residues such as ARG39, ASN114, SER164, TYR178, and LYS182 retained the equilibrium distance after 25 ns. As ASN114, TYR178, and LYS182 were present at the beta and helix secondary structure, the distances from these residues were found to be more consistent compared to ARG39 and SER164 which were located in the turn of the secondary structure. This analysis showed that binding site residues maintained favourable distance for a stable molecular interaction. In case of the VelB complex, all binding site residues were located at the coiled coil secondary structure, and analysis of the centre mean distance from curcumin with binding site residues will further provide evidence of curcumin stability in the coiled coil binding region of VelB receptor protein. As it can be seen from Supplementary Figure S4, all six selected binding site residues (ARG131, PRO127, SER119, HIS133, SER118, and TYR125) maintained equilibrium distances after 25 ns simulation time. All distances have undergone shape drifts transiently at ~65 ns and thereafter returned to initial equilibrium distances. This calculation clearly suggests that despite the coiled coil region of the binding site, curcumin well oriented in the VelB-binding site. To further establish the fact that curcumin orientation in the protein-binding site of both proteins remains stable, curcumin RMSD was measured and plotted in a time evolution manner in Supplementary Figure S5. Similar to the distance in\nFrontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin.org11\nSupplementary Figures S3, S4, curcumin stabilized its orientation in the respective binding site after 25 ns of simulation.\nApart from complex structural stability, interaction stability was assessed by calculating the number of hydrogen bonds formed between curcumin and receptor protein along the simulation time. The THR\u2013curcumin complex formed on average one hydrogen bond with more than 90% occupancy, while the VelB\u2013curcumin complex formed on average one hydrogen bond with more than 82% of simulation time (Figure 10)."

            "text": "A fundamental problem with Curvularia infections is the risk of transferring a genetically evolved isolate from farms to humans. Such transferability through the human\u2013plant interaction or intake of contaminated air could cause\nresistance against available antifungal drugs since field isolates suffer from fungicide selective pressure and undergo virulence differentiation to adapt to adverse conditions (Bengyella et al., 2017). Curvularia spp. are sensitive to triazoles, and there are chances of interlocking lifestyle and fungicide pressure which may lead to the development of resistance in immunocompromised patients receiving azole therapy (Bengyella et al., 2017). Occurrence of antifungal resistance in fungal diseases along with a genetically evolved Curvularia spp. imparts the search for new therapy to control fungal infections though it is a major challenge of present-day treatment. There are known natural compounds that can control the disease caused by C. lunata; for example, essential oil of Cymbopogon citratus and extract of Cinnamomum zeylani are reported to inhibit conidial germination and reduce disease progress (Mishra et al., 2009; Mour\u00e3o et al., 2017).\nIn the present study, natural compounds, namely, \u03b1-pinene, curcumin, berberine, and eugenol were studied for their\nTABLE 4 Physicochemical analysis of potential inhibitors of THR and VelB proteins of C. lunata.\nCompounds ADME properties (Lipinski\u2019s Rule of Five) Molecular weight Molecular formula Radar diagram\n\u03b1-Pinene Molecular weight (g/mol) 136.23 C10H16 LogP 3.44\nH-bond donor 0\nH-bond acceptor 0\nViolation 0\nCurcumin Molecular weight (g/mol) 368.38 C21H20O6\nLogP 1.47\nH-bond donor 2\nH-bond acceptor 6\nViolation 0\nBerberine Molecular weight (g/mol) 336.36 C20H18NO4\nLogP 2.19\nH-bond donor 0\nH-bond acceptor 4\nViolation 0\nEugenol Molecular weight (g/mol) 164.20 C10H12O2\nLogP 2.25\nH-bond donor 1\nH-bond acceptor 2\nViolation 0\nNote: According to Lipinski\u2019s rule, molecular weight <500 g/mol, lipophilicity (MlogP) <5, hydrogen bond acceptor <5, and hydrogen bond donor <10 are considered.\nFrontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin.org12\nantifungal activity against C. lunata. The fungal growth was completely inhibited by curcumin (78 \u03bcg/ml), berberine (156 \u03bcg/ml), eugenol, (156 \u03bcg/ml) and \u03b1-pinene (1250 \u03bcg/ ml). In the studies conducted elsewhere, \u03b1-pinene showed significant antifungal activity, with greater inhibitory activity against Candida parapsilosis, and proved to be effective in inhibiting fungal growth (N\u00f3brega et al., 2021). Previously reported MIC of berberine was 125 \u03bcg/ml against C. lunata (Kokkrua et al., 2020), whereas in the current study it was calculated as 156 \u03bcg/ml. Eugenol also inhibited the growth of fungi at 156 \u03bcg/ml, and similar results were reported for the antifungal activity of eugenol against T. rubrum strains (64\u2013512 \u03bcg/ml) (de Oliveira Pereira et al., 2013). The extract of Curcuma longa also reported strong inhibitory effect on various pathogenic fungi at 1 mg/ml concentration (Chen et al., 2018), and antifungal effect of curcumin has been reported on Aspergillus spp. at 0.2 mg/ml (Martins et al., 2008; Gitika et al., 2019) and Candida spp. at 0.1\u20132 mg/ml (Narayanan et al., 2020).\nThe interaction between host plants and conidia of C. lunata begins with the adherence of conidia onto the leaf surface (Xie et al., 2020). Once the conidia adhere, they start to germinate and form appressoria. The cell wall of appressoria contains melanin which aids to provide mechanical strength for host tissue penetration. In C. lunata, sporulation and germination are crucial steps for spreading the disease (Xie et al., 2020). In the present study, our compounds suppressed sporulation as well as hyphal growth at IC50 (curcumin, 39 \u03bcg/ml; berberine, 78 \u03bcg/ml; eugenol, 78 \u03bcg/ml; and \u03b1-pinene, 625 \u03bcg/ml). The spore germination and its pathogenicity were studied on the onion epidermis layer, where the compound-treated (\u03b1-pinene, curcumin, berberine, and eugenol) conidia failed to adhere and germinate on the surface. The invasive hyphae of C. lunata were observed when untreated conidia were observed under light and electron microscope. Another study on spore germination of Curvularia maculans reported that berberine affected the germination process of the fungus (Basha et al., 2002). Biochemical assay showed that curcumin exhibited a\nFrontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin.org13\nsignificant reduction in conidial hydrophobicity as compared to the control. It might be due to curcumin interacting with the conidial wall/membrane and disturbing the cell integrity (Srivastava et al., 2020).\nUnlike other fungi, not much is studied about C. lunata pathogenesis at the molecular level. Melanin is one of the reported virulence factors which can improve mechanical strength of appressorium required for penetration inside the host (Ri\u017ener and Wheeler, 2003). It is produced from 1,8- dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) via the pentaketide pathway in this fungus; crucial genes involved in the pathway are pks18, scd1, and brn1 (Baker et al., 2006; Liu T. et al., 2011). According to Liu T. et al (2011) and Wang et al. (2020), brn1 gene deletion led to improper DHN-melanin biosynthesis as well as\naccumulation in the cell wall which also affects the production of other mycotoxins by this fungus. The current study observed significant down-regulation of pks18 and brn1 genes when the pathogen comes in contact with bioactive compounds. The velvet genes/proteins also play a significant role in regulating secondary metabolism, cell wall integrity pathway, and sporulation (Calvo, 2008; Gao et al., 2017). It has been reported that deletion of velB gene exhibited reduced growth rate and conidiation with increased aerial hyphae formation (Gao et al., 2017). In the present study, the expression of velB gene, which is a key member of velvet protein synthesis, was significantly down-regulated in the presence of \u03b1-pinene, curcumin, berberine, and eugenol. Mitogen-activated protein kinase gene clm1 regulated cell\nFrontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin.org14\nwall integrity, conidiophore formation, and cell-degrading enzyme activity (Liu T. et al., 2011; Ni et al., 2018). The presence of bioactive compounds (\u03b1-pinene, curcumin, berberine, and eugenol) showed that there was a significant down-regulation of clm1 gene of C. lunata, which might result in decreased cell wall integrity as well as conidia formation. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression level of pks18, brn1, velB, and clm1 genes were reduced compared to that in the control. Hence, conidia were unable to maintain integrity for their growth and sporulation.\nReported mutant studies of brn1, MAPK gene, and toxinrelated gene deletion led to a decrease in sporulation as well as virulence (Liu T. et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2012). In case of compound treatment, it was found that the conidia germination process was inhibited as shown in SEM images, and therefore the expression of brn1, clm1, and velB genes could be decreased. Another mutant study reported that \u0394ClVelB showed high expression of pks18, brn1, and cmr1 genes at 48 h and 60 h gene expression study (Gao et al., 2017). Also, velB gene deletion indicated the increase in osmotic resistance which suggests that velB gene involved in the regulation of cell wall integrity. Our study also suggested that the presence of compounds decreases velB gene expression which might result in decreased toxin production and cell wall integrity.\nFurthermore, to understand the possible targets of compounds (\u03b1-pinene, curcumin, berberine, and eugenol), an in silico docking approach was used for virulence proteins involved in the melanin pathway and conidiation. The\nvirulence proteins THR and VelB were responsible for the melanin biosynthesis pathway, and conidiation and methyl 5- (hydroxymethyl) furan-2-carboxylate toxin production, respectively. Molecular docking of compounds with THR and VelB proteins showed significant negative binding affinity using AutoDock4.2.3. Polyketide synthase plays an important role in the pathogenicity, which synthesised THR, another crucial step for the biosynthesis of DHNmelanin in both mycelia and conidia (Lu et al., 2022). The velvet family protein is reported to play a key role in the regulation of secondary metabolism, fungal growth, and sporulation in many filamentous fungi (Gao et al., 2017). The main member of the velvet protein family is VelB protein in a few fungal species, according to the literature (Bayram et al., 2008; Wiemann et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2017). Curcumin is observed to have the highest negative binding energy and hydrogen bonds with both THR and VelB proteins. Berberine and eugenol also showed good binding affinity with both virulence proteins, whereas \u03b1pinene did not form hydrogen bonds with THR as well as VelB proteins and also the binding affinity was comparatively lower. The docking interaction indicated that the protein\u2013ligand complexes that had good binding affinity were those that formed the highest number of hydrogen bonds (Shamsi et al., 2022). Curcumin-bound complexes of THR and VelB receptor proteins were employed to understand the stability and dynamical behaviour of the complexes. Also, 100 ns MD simulation analysis highlights the gain in the structural stability after binding of the curcumin molecules. In both complexes, the curcumin molecule remains stable in the corresponding binding site of the protein and forms one hydrogen bond with more than 80% of the time. This result suggests the possibility of designing a high-affinity inhibitor carrying the curcumin scaffold entity.\nPlant-derived compounds (\u03b1-pinene, curcumin, berberine, and eugenol) are effective against C. lunata. The natural bioactive compounds possess less toxicity and associated side effects, which makes them a suitable candidate for drug discovery. Among all, curcumin exhibited effective antifungal properties to inhibit the growth of the fungus. Conidia adherence and their germination were restricted by the activity of these compounds. It was shown that the compounds down-regulate brn1, velB, pks18, and clm1 gene expression, leading to decreased cell wall integrity and sporulation. The correlation between the virulence gene down-regulation and in silico molecular docking interaction represented the potential antifungal activity of bioactive compounds and highlighted virulence proteins THR and VelB as a possible drug target.\nFIGURE 10 Distribution of the hydrogen bonds formed by curcumin with THR and VelB receptors at the binding site.\nFrontiers in Molecular Biosciences frontiersin.org15"
