            "text": "19 Cognitive Reserve (CR) refers to the preservation of cognitive function in the face of age- or 20 disease-related neuroanatomical decline. While bilingualism is known to contribute to CR, the 21 extent to which, and what particular aspect of, second language experience contributes to CR are 22 debated, and the underlying neural mechanism(s) unknown. Intrinsic functional connectivity 23 reflects experience-dependent neuroplasticity that occurs across timescales ranging from minutes 24 to decades, and may be a neural mechanism underlying CR. To test this hypothesis, we used 25 voxel-based morphometry and resting-state functional connectivity analyses of MRI data to 26 compare structural and functional brain integrity between bilingual and monolingual older adults, 27 matched on cognitive performance using a rigorous propensity score matching technique, and 28 across levels of second language proficiency measured as a continuous variable. Bilingualism, 29 and degree of second language proficiency in particular, were associated with lower grey matter 30 integrity in a hub of the default mode network \u2013 a region that is particularly vulnerable to decline 31 in aging and dementia \u2013 but preserved functional network organization that resembled the young 32 adult brain. Our findings confirm that lifelong bilingualism contributes to CR through 33 experience-dependent maintenance of optimal functional network structure of the domain-34 general attentional control network across the lifespan. 35\nMultiple factors contribute to Cognitive Reserve (CR) across the lifespan, such as education, 36 occupation, and intellectual and social engagement (Cabeza et al., 2018; Song et al., 2022; Stern, 37 2021). There is compelling evidence that lifelong bilingualism also contributes to CR (Anderson 38 et al., 2020; Bialystok, 2021). Relative to their monolingual peers, bilingual older adults 1) have 39 better cognitive function, given similar levels of neuroanatomical decline, 2) demonstrate signs 40 of dementia later in life, 3) show more significant neuroanatomical pathology, given similar 41 levels of dementia, and 4) show more rapid rates of cognitive decline in later stages of dementia 42 (Bialystok, 2021). Bilingual individuals must continuously exert cognitive control to 43 appropriately direct their attention towards one situationally relevant language of two that are 44 simultaneously active in mind and competing for attention (Kroll et al., 2014; van Heuven et al., 45 2008). Evidence suggests that this ongoing need for selection leads to an adaptation in domain-46 general attentional control that enhances multiple subordinate cognitive control process across a 47 range of tasks and mitigates typical age-related cognitive decline (Bialystok, 2015; Bialystok and 48 Craik, 2022). This adaptation is the foundation for CR in bilingualism (Bialystok, 2021). Thus, 49 bilingualism serves as a useful proxy for investigating neural mechanisms underlying CR. Given 50 the evidence that lifelong bilingualism is a CR factor, two predictions are that 1) given equal 51 neuroanatomical health, bilinguals will have better cognitive performance than monolinguals and 52 2) given equal cognitive performance, bilinguals will have poorer neuroanatomical health than 53 monolinguals. Both relationships have been confirmed in recent work (Anderson et al., 2021; 54 Berkes et al., 2021; Brian T. Gold et al., 2013; Perani et al., 2017; Schweizer et al., 2012). 55 56 The neural mechanism underlying CR in bilingualism is unknown. Studies investigating 57 differences in brain structure associated with bilingualism have produced mixed, often 58\ncontradictory results. For example, while some studies have shown better structural integrity in 59 bilingual than monolingual individuals (John A.E. Anderson et al., 2018; Luk et al., 2011; 60 Marin-Marin et al., 2020; Olsen et al., 2015), others have shown the opposite (Anderson et al., 61 2021; Brian T. Gold et al., 2013; Schweizer et al., 2012), or dissociable patterns of grey vs. white 62 matter integrity (Macbeth et al., 2021). While the underlying neural mechanisms by which 63 augmented cognitive engagement across the lifespan leads to preservation of cognitive faculties 64 in later life are undetermined, there might be multiple pathways to CR (Oh et al., 2018). Another 65 possibility is that CR might result from adaptive shifts in cognitive strategy or more efficient 66 task-related engagement of brain regions or circuits (Abutalebi et al., 2012; Anderson et al., 67 2021; B. T. Gold et al., 2013). A third possibility is that experience-dependent maintenance or 68 enhancement of the brain\u2019s long-term intrinsic functional network integrity could be a neural 69 mechanism underlying CR (Chan et al., 2021, 2018; N. Franzmeier et al., 2017; Nicolai 70 Franzmeier et al., 2017b; Weiler et al., 2018; Wig, 2017). 71 72 RSFC, which can be quantified by analyzing spontaneous fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-73 level-dependent (BOLD) signal in resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data, reflects the brain's 74 intrinsic large-scale functional network architecture [for example, see refs. (Biswal et al., 1995; 75 Fox and Raichle, 2007)]. RSFC plays a central role in human cognition through a Hebbian-like 76 mechanism, whereby repeated experience-driven coupling or decoupling of task-related activity 77 among brain regions over time lead to enduring increases or decreases in RSFC among these 78 regions, respectively (Stevens and Spreng, 2014). This, in turn, facilitates or inhibits future 79 coupling (Kelly and Castellanos, 2014), thus enhancing or optimizing cognitive performance 80 with experience over time. Thus, RSFC reflects a previously unappreciated mechanism of long-81\nterm neurocognitive plasticity that allows past experiences to mold sustained functional network 82 architecture to facilitate future cognitive performance. Research on RSFC has demonstrated that 83 1) it can be modulated by ongoing or recent experience across functionally relevant brain 84 regions/circuits/networks on relatively short timescales ranging from minutes to days (Martin et 85 al., 2021); 2) the degree of sustained experience-dependent change predicts learning, memory 86 consolidation, and future performance (Lewis et al., 2009; Stevens et al., 2010; Tambini et al., 87 2010); 3) patterns of RSFC are correlated with individual differences in personality, behavior, 88 and cognition (Adelstein et al., 2011; Nostro et al., 2018); and 4) differential patterns of RSFC 89 are associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and the extent of 90 neurocognitive decline/preservation in old age (Stevens and Spreng, 2014; Wig, 2017). Thus, 91 RSFC reflects a critical process underlying long-term neurocognitive plasticity that facilitates the 92 development, specialization, stabilization, and preservation of large-scale functional brain 93 networks across the lifespan. While there may be multiple pathways to CR, we propose that 94 experience-dependent maintenance of intrinsic functional networks is a fundamental neural 95 mechanism that could underly the phenomenon of CR in lifelong bilingualism. 96 97 Various RSFC analytic techniques can be used to parcellate the brain into multiple functionally 98 dissociable regions that are organized into large-scale functional sub-networks with varying 99\ndegrees of spatial resolution (Power et al., 2011; Schaefer et al., 2018; Wig et al., 2014; Yeo et 100 al., 2011). Previous work has focussed on three specific sub-networks that play foundational 101 roles in higher cognitive functioning (Grady et al., 2016; Setton et al., 2022; Spreng et al., 2013; 102 Spreng and Schacter, 2012): 1) the dorsal attention network (DAN), involved in externally 103 focussed cognition; 2) the default mode network (DMN), involved in internally focussed 104\ncognition; and 3) the frontoparietal control network (FPCN), which facilitates volitional control 105 over the locus of attention by flexibly alternating its coupling between the DAN vs. DMN during 106 externally vs. internally focussed cognition, respectively (Spreng et al., 2010). Critically, 107 different nodes within these networks play specialized roles in facilitating within-network 108 communication and cross-network interactions among these networks, a set of dynamics that can 109 be characterized and quantified using graph theory analyses (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010; Wig et 110 al., 2011). Previous work has identified two discrete nodes of the FPCN within the left middle 111 frontal gyrus (MFG) that play opposite but complementary roles \u2013 an anterior region (aMFG; 112 Brodmann area (BA) 9) that has dense within-network connections but little cross-network 113 connectivity with other networks (i.e., a \u201cprovincial hub node\u201d), and a posterior region (pMFG; 114 BA 6), which has high betweenness centrality, a measure of the extent to which a node 115 contributes to communication across networks (i.e., a \u201cconnector node\u201d) (Spreng et al., 2013). 116 These two nodes are thought to play critical roles in attentional control through mediating 117 within-network communication of the FPCN, and dynamic flexibility of cross-network coupling 118 with the DAN and DMN, respectively (Spreng et al., 2013). There is evidence that age-related 119 cognitive decline is related to functional connectivity changes most prominently within the 120 FPCN (Campbell et al., 2012), and of the MFG in particular (Spreng et al., 2018). 121 122 While some aspects of cognition decline in old age, such as working memory, episodic memory, 123 and processing speed, others remain stable or improve across the lifespan, such as semantic 124 memory and verbal knowledge (Park et al., 2002). This pattern of age-related change has been 125 characterized as a shift from fluid to crystalized cognition in later life (Craik and Bialystok, 126 2006), and it is correlated with increased RSFC of the left middle frontal gyrus, a core node of 127\nthe FPCN, with the DMN \u2013 a phenomenon characterized by the \u201cdefault-executive coupling 128 hypothesis of aging\u201d (DECHA) (Spreng and Turner, 2019). The DECHA is consistent with prior 129 work demonstrating that 1) unlike young adults, older adults \u201cfail to deactivate\u201d the DMN during 130 externally focussed cognition (Grady et al., 2006; Lustig et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2008) and 2) 131 age-related differences in how the FPCN connects with other networks impacts both the function 132 of these other networks and cognitive ability in older adults (Grady et al., 2016). 133 134 Here, we investigated the hypothesis that lifelong bilingualism contributes to CR by mitigating 135 the typical age-related changes in functional connectivity of the FPCN described above (e.g., 136 DECHA (Spreng et al., 2018)), specifically, by bolstering functional integration within the 137 FPCN and maintaining the dynamic flexibility of its cross-network coupling with the DMN and 138 DAN (Spreng et al., 2010). To isolate the extent to which lifelong bilingualism contributes to 139 CR, one must either compare cognitive performance between monolingual and bilingual groups 140 equated for neuroanatomical health (Berkes et al., 2021), with the expectation that bilinguals will 141 outperform monolinguals; or alternatively, compare differences in brain structure and function 142 between groups equated for cognitive performance (John A.E. Anderson et al., 2018), with the 143 expectation that bilinguals will show more prominent signs of neuroanatomical aging. Here, we 144 took the latter approach, and compared brain structure and intrinsic functional network integrity 145 in groups of monolingual vs. bilingual older adults equated on multiple measures of cognitive 146 performance and demographic variables using a rigorous propensity score matching (PSM) 147 technique. Recent research has also supported the view that bilingualism is better characterized 148 and investigated as a multidimensional set of continuous variables on which individuals vary 149 based on language experience, rather than a dichotomous variable separating individuals into 150\nostensibly homogenous groups (Dash et al., 2022; DeLuca et al., 2019; Gullifer and Titone, 151 2020; Macbeth et al., 2021; Sulpizio et al., 2020). Moreover, previous behavioural research has 152 implicated the active use and proficiency of a second language as the critical factor that might 153 contribute most to CR in bilingual older adults (Calabria et al., 2020). Thus, we also assessed the 154 degree to which these measures of structural and functional brain integrity are associated with 155 second language proficiency, measured as a continuous variable across all older adults in our 156 sample. We predicted that bilingual older adults would show more prominent signs of 157 neuroanatomical aging (i.e., \u201colder looking\u201d brain structure), but preserved integrity of intrinsic 158 functional network connectivity (i.e., \u201cyounger looking\u201d brain functional organization) relative 159 to cognitively matched monolinguals, who would show typical patterns of degraded functional 160 network connectivity associated with aging. Specifically, we hypothesized that 1) bilingual older 161 adults will show lower grey matter integrity in brain regions that are particularly susceptible to 162 age-related decline (e.g., DMN regions); 2) bilinguals will show less default-executive coupling, 163 i.e., RSFC between the MFG and the DMN, a hallmark characteristic of neurocognitive aging 164 (Spreng and Turner, 2019); 3) bilinguals will show preserved flexibility of cross-network RSFC 165 of the MFG with the DAN and DMN; and 4) these measures of structural and functional integrity 166 will be associated with second language proficiency specifically, across all older adults. 167 168 Results 169 Ninety-three right-handed older adult participants (age: mean \u00b1 SD = 74.04 \u00b1 3.86, range = 68-170 85; 63 female) with no history of heart disease, neurological or psychological disorders, or 171 traumatic brain injuries, were recruited from the local area surrounding York University, 172 Toronto, Canada (Note: An additional 3 participants were recruited but not included in this 173\nstudy, due to excessive head motion in the MRI scanner). Behavioral and structural MRI data 174 from a subset of these participants have been analyzed in previous reports (Anderson et al., 2021, 175 2017; John A.E. Anderson et al., 2018).

Anderson et al., 2018)] was used to categorize participants as monolingual or 177 bilingual (LSBQ composite score) and to assign a score on second language proficiency (LSBQ 178 factor), a continuous variable. Participants were interviewed via telephone to validate language 179 status, and those who could not be reliably identified as monolingual or bilingual were not 180 included in the study. Forty-seven participants (29 female) were identified as bilingual and 46 181 (34 female) were identified as monolingual. All participants completed the D-KEFS battery 182 (Delis et al., 2001), comprising multiple neuropsychological tests of executive function, and the 183 Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975)]. We used a PSM technique to 184 equate the groups across performance on multiple cognitive measures (MMSE, Trail Making 185 Task (letter-number-switching score), Shipley-2 verbal score, Shipley-2 block patterns score), as 186 well as demographic variables (age, education, gender), similar to previous work (John A.E. 187 Anderson et al., 2018). We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis of structural MRI 188 data, and RSFC analyses of resting-state fMRI data, to compare neuroanatomical and intrinsic 189 functional network integrity, respectively, between the groups and across second language 190 proficiency. 191 192 Propensity score matching on cognitive measures and demographic variables 193 Previous research has used sequential bivariate matching; however, this fails to account for 194 potential multivariate interactions between the matching variables and may introduce bias into 195 participant selection when using a high dimensional set of matching criteria (John A.E. Anderson 196\net al., 2018; Ho et al., 2007; Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). With PSM, a propensity score for 197 each individual is obtained by using logistic regression to predict group membership, given a set 198 of observed covariates. Participants from one group are then individually matched to those in the 199 second group based on propensity scores (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). PSM can account for 200 multivariate interactions, minimizes selection error when using a large number of matching 201 variables, and is better suited for smaller sample sizes, as is often the case in neuroimaging 202 studies (Austin and Steyerberg, 2015; Ho et al., 2007; Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). To 203 prioritize matching the monolingual and bilingual groups on cognitive performance, PSM was 204 done using the MatchIt R package (Ho et al., 2011) in a 2-stage hierarchical manner. The first 205 stage matched the groups on 4 neuropsychological measures: MMSE, Trail Making Task (letter-206 number-switching score), Shipley-2 verbal score, and Shipley-2 block patterns score. Using the 207 propensity scores, each bilingual participant was matched to a monolingual; bilinguals that could 208 not be matched, and any remaining monolinguals, were removed from the matched-group 209 analyses. The distribution of propensity scores for the matched monolingual and bilingual 210 groups, as well as for the excluded participants from each of the unmatched groups, are shown in 211 Supplementary Figure 1a. Once the groups were matched on cognitive performance, they were 212 then matched on 3 demographic variables (age, education, and sex) using the same procedure. 213 The distribution of propensity scores for the two matched groups following the second stage are 214 shown in Supplementary Figure 1b. The absolute standardized mean difference between 215 monolinguals and bilinguals on each of the matching variables for the matched vs. unmatched 216 groups are show in Supplementary Figure 1c. Following the PSM procedure, the final group 217 sizes were 39 monolinguals (age: mean \u00b1 SD = 73.51 \u00b1 3.25, range = 68-79; 30 female) and 39 218\nbilinguals (age: mean \u00b1 SD = 73.87 \u00b1 4.00, range = 69-83; 23 female). The matched groups did 219 not differ significantly on any of the cognitive or demographic variables (Table 1). 220 221\n223 ML, monolingual; BL bilingual; * p < 0.01. 224 225 226 Second language proficiency as a continuous variable across all older adults 227 The quantity and quality of exposure to multiple languages is extremely variable across 228 individuals, and most have at least some experience with a second language. A recent study 229 reported that more than 80% of nearly 1,000 respondents in the United Kingdom who claimed to 230 be monolingual English-speakers had learned other languages at some point in their lives, 231 sometimes to high degrees of fluency (Castro et al., 2022). Previous behavioural research has 232 implicated the active use and proficiency of a second language as the critical factor that might 233 contribute most to CR in bilingual older adults (Calabria et al., 2020). In addition to the 234 composite score, the LSBQ quantifies second language proficiency based on a factor analysis, 235 which produced a latent variable comprising clustered items that were identified as representing 236\nsecond language proficiency. The eigenvalue from this latent variable is used as the quantitative 237 measure of second language proficiency (for details, see ref. 59). Thus, an important subscale of 238 the LSBQ is second language proficiency, on which individual participants vary along a 239 continuum (John A. E. Anderson et al., 2018). To test the hypothesis that second language 240 proficiency is a key factor that contributes to CR in bilingualism, we correlated normalized 241 scores on this factor with normalized measures of neuroanatomical and intrinsic functional 242 network integrity across our entire sample of 93 older adults included in the study. 243 244 Monolingual adults have higher grey matter density in a core hub of the DMN 245 To test the hypothesis that monolingual older adults will have higher neuroanatomical 246 integrity than bilinguals when the groups are equated on cognitive performance, we quantified 247 grey matter density across the brain using VBM analysis (FSL-VBM software suite) of T1-248 weighted structural MRI images. This analysis identified a large cluster in the posterior cingulate 249 cortex (pCC), a core hub of the DMN (Buckner et al., 2009; Hagmann et al., 2008; van Oort et 250 al., 2014), that showed higher grey matter density in monolingual older adults relative to the 251 bilinguals [p < 0.05, cluster corrected for multiple comparisons using ETAC (Cox, 2019)] (Fig. 252 1a-b). Morever, grey matter density in the pCC was negatively correlated with second language 253 proficiency across the entire sampe of older adults (r = -0.30; p = 0.002, 2-tailed; Fig. 1c). 254\n255\nFigure 1. Differences in structural integrity estimated using VBM. (a) Comparing groups 256 matched on cognitive performance using PSM, monolinguals have higher grey matter density 257 than bilinguals in the posterior cingulate cortex, a hub of the DMN (p < 0.05, ETAC corrected; 258 cluster centre of mass: x = -3, y = -50, z = 30, mni_152 coordinates). (b) Mean grey matter 259 density in the pCC cluster showing a significant difference between the matched groups (solid 260 bars); distribution of values for all participants (triangles) overlaid with the first and third 261 quartiles (box), interquartile range (whiskers), and density curve for each group.

The locations of 43 network nodes across these 3 networks were 272 based on previous work that identified and characterized these networks based on both task-273 related and resting-state fMRI data (Spreng et al., 2013). The full matrices of the group means 274 for all pairwise correlations between nodes for the monolingual and bilingual groups were 275 calculated, and the latter subtracted from the former to produce the group difference matrix 276 (Supplementary Fig. 2). The upper half of the matrix shows the group difference in mean 277 pairwise correlation values; the lower half of the matrix is thresholded to show only the 278\nstatistically significant differences (permutation test: q < 0.05, FDR-corrected for multiple 279 comparisons across the entire matrix). Significant differences in RSFC between the monolingual 280 and bilingual groups were highly specific and consistent with our hypotheses, with the 281 monolinguals showing stronger RSFC between the aMFG in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) and 282 multiple nodes of the DMN only, including dorsomedial PFC, pCC, left posterior inferior 283 parietal cortex, left superior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal sulcus, and ventromedial PFC 284 (Fig. 2a,b). Mean RSFC between the aMFG and each of the 6 DMN nodes was also negatively 285 correlated with second language proficiency across the entire sample of older adults (r = -0.29; p 286 = 0.005, 2-tailed; Fig. 2c). 287\n288\nFigure 2.

(a) Monolingual older adults 289 show stronger RSFC of the left aMFG with multiple nodes of the DMN only (i.e., default-290 executive coupling), relative to bilinguals, including the dmPFC, pCC, left IPL, left SFG, left 291 STS, and vmPFC (p < 0.05 FDR corrected for all pairwise correlations among all 43 nodes of the 292 FPCN, DMN, and DAN) displayed on a glass brain representation of left hemisphere (see also 293 Supplementary Fig. 2); orange lines/circles indicate significantly stronger pairwise RSFC in the 294 monolingual older adults.

(c) Across all older adults (n=93), second language 298 proficiency is negatively correlated with mean RSFC between the aMFG and the 6 nodes of the 299 DMN (r = -0.29; p = 0.005, 2-tailed).

The monolingual group showed significantly higher clustering of the aMFG with 313 the whole DMN than the bilingual group (mean difference = 0.20; permutation test: p = 0.04, 2-314 tailed) (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, clustering of the aMFG with the DMN was negatively correlated 315 with second language proficiency across the entire sample of older adults (r = -0.22; p = 0.03, 2-316 tailed; Fig. 3c). 317 318\n319\nFigure 3.

Previous work identified a key connector node of the FPCN in the pMFG 350 with very high betweenness centrality, a graph theory analysis metric that quantifies the extent to 351 which a node contributes to cross-network communication; thus, this node is thought to play a 352 critical role in cognitive flexibility (Spreng et al., 2013). To assess potential differences in the 353 flexibility of cross-network communication in monolingual vs. bilingual older adults, we 354 compared the betweenness centrality of the pMFG (see Fig. 3d for illustration of betweenness 355 centrality calculation, displayed in the left hemishpere) between the two groups. Bilingual older 356 adults showed higher betweenness centrality of the pMFG than the monolinguals (mean 357 difference = -45.06; permutation test: p = 0.04, 2-tailed; Fig. 3e). Finally, betweenness centrality 358 of the pMFG was positively correlated with second language proficiency across the entire 359 sample of older adults (r = 0.20; p = 0.04, 2-tailed; Fig. 3f). 360 361 Discussion 362 Here, we demonstrate that when equated on cognitive performance using a rigorous matching 363 procedure, bilingual older adults had lower grey matter density than their monolingual peers in 364 the pCC, a hub of the DMN, which is particularly susceptible to structural and functional decline 365 in aging and neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Alzheimer\u2019s disease) (Buckner, 2005; Grady et al., 366 2006; Lustig et al., 2003). This finding confirms that lifelong bilingualism is a CR factor, as it 367\ndemonstrates that bilingual older adults perform just as well as their monolingual peers on tasks 368 of executive function despite showing signs of more advanced neuroanatomical aging. In 369 contrast, the bilingual older adults had preserved intrinsic functional network structure, related to 370 executive function and cognitive flexibility specifically, more consistent with that of younger 371 brains (Spreng et al., 2013) than their monolinguals peers. While the monolingual older adults 372 showed more prominent coupling of a hub node (aMFG) of the FPCN with the DMN, a hallmark 373 characteristic of advanced age associated with a shift from fluid to crystalized cognition (Spreng 374 et al., 2018), the bilinguals showed higher betweenness centrality of a connector node of the 375 FPCN (pMFG), thought to underly cognitive flexibility (Spreng et al., 2013). Moreover, across 376 all older adults, second language proficiency was negatively correlated with structural integrity, 377 but positively correlated with multiple measures of intrinsic functional network integrity. These 378 findings confirm that lifelong bilingualism, and second language proficiency in particular, 379 contribute to CR, and support our hypotheses that this occurs through a process of bolstering the 380 functional integrity, and maintaining neurocognitive flexibility, of the FPCN. Thus, a neural 381 mechanism underlying CR in bilingualism is the experience-dependent maintenance of optimal 382 intrinsic functional network structure in the face of neuroanatomical changes across the lifespan. 383 384 Several studies have investigated the possibility that lifelong bilingualism could lead to the 385 preservation of, and/or compensatory increases in, the brain\u2019s neuroanatomical structure by 386 investigating white matter integrity using diffusion tensor imaging MRI. While some studies 387 reported higher white matter integrity associated with bilingualism in older adults (John A.E. 388 Anderson et al., 2018; Luk et al., 2011; Marin-Marin et al., 2020; Olsen et al., 2015), others 389 reported prominent widespread declines in white matter integrity (Anderson et al., 2021; Brian T. 390\nGold et al., 2013; Schweizer et al., 2012). A lack of consensus on the potential role of 391 experience-dependent plasticity of brain structure in CR underscores the need for more research 392 in this area using rigorous matching techniques to compare monolingual vs. bilingual groups \u2013 393 i.e., to delineate neuroanatomical differences associated with bilingualism per se, groups must be 394 equated on cognitive performance (Anderson et al., 2021; John A. E. Anderson et al., 2018). One 395 study that did this provided evidence of a more nuanced relationship between lifelong 396 bilingualism and brain structural integrity in older adults. Cognitively healthy bilingual older 397 adults had lower structural integrity of both grey and white matter globally, relative to 398 monolinguals, but the bilinguals also had higher white and grey matter integrity within focal 399 regions putatively involved in executive cognitive function specifically (Anderson et al., 2021). 400 401 Research has also investigated the possibility that differences in the way brain regions are 402 engaged during task performance between monolingual and bilingual older adults could underlie 403 or be a consequence of CR. Monolingual older adults show increased engagement of frontal 404 brain regions or circuits reflective of increased cognitive effort at lower levels of task difficulty 405 than bilingual adults, akin to differences between older and younger adults, respectively (Grundy 406 et al., 2017). For example, monolingual older adults, despite having higher overall grey and 407 white matter integrity than bilinguals, performed worse on a 2-back working memory task, and 408 showed increased engagement of a frontostriatal circuit, including the left MFG in particular, 409 during task performance (Anderson et al., 2021). Decreased task-related activation of frontal 410 brain regions in bilingual older adults has been interpreted as increased efficiency (Grundy et al., 411 2017). However, the underlying structural or functional properties that could facilitate this more 412 efficient task-related processing under certain task conditions have not been determined. We 413\npropose that intrinsic functional network connectivity \u2013 which is bolstered by task-related 414 activity over time, which in turn facilitates future task performance \u2013 underlies the more efficient 415 dynamic neurocognitive processing in bilingual older adults measured at the task-level. 416 417 Previous studies using fMRI to investigate potential differences in RSFC associated with 418 bilingualism (Berken et al., 2016; Dash et al., 2022; DeLuca et al., 2019; Grady et al., 2015; 419 Gullifer et al., 2018; Li et al., 2015; Luk et al., 2011; Marin-Marin et al., 2021; Thieba et al., 420 2019) have typically focussed on younger adults only, had small sample sizes, and/or failed to 421 explicitly or adequately account for cognitive performance or neuroanatomical differences across 422 groups of older individuals, complicating interpretations and limiting inferences about how 423 observed changes are associated with CR per se. Nevertheless, our results are broadly consistent 424 with previous work reporting increased RSFC primarily among regions involved in cognitive 425 control (Grady et al., 2015) and attention networks specifically (Dash et al., 2022), in older 426 bilingual adults. Previous work has also investigated differences in RSFC associated with 427 various other CR factors across the lifespan (Anthony and Lin, 2018; Benson et al., 2018; Chan 428 et al., 2021, 2018; N. Franzmeier et al., 2017; Nicolai Franzmeier et al., 2017a; Pietzuch et al., 429 2019; Stern et al., 2021; Weiler et al., 2018). One study demonstrated that level of education, as 430 a proxy for CR, was positively correlated with increased RSFC between a left PFC region of the 431 FPCN and the DAN, and negatively correlated with RSFC of this region with the DMN, in older 432 adults with mild cognitive impairment (Nicolai Franzmeier et al., 2017b). The latter result 433 parallels our findings of a negative correlation between second language proficiency and RSFC 434 of the FPCN (aMFG) with the DMN, and increased RSFC between these regions in monolingual 435 older adults, relative to bilinguals. This suggests that our discovery of the critical role of left 436\nMFG connectivity with other networks in CR associated with bilingualism might generalize to 437 other CR factors as well, a hypothesis that should be investigated in future work using the 438 analyses described here. 439 440 How could bilingualism have a long-term influence on RSFC of intrinsic functional networks? 441 Managing multiple simultaneously active languages (Kroll et al., 2012; van Heuven et al., 2008) 442 requires dynamically alternating the locus of one\u2019s attention between the external environment, 443 to monitor the situationally relevant language, and the content of one\u2019s internal mental 444 environment. Age-related memory declines are due, in part, to distraction resulting from a 445 reduced ability to ignore task-irrelevant information (Healey et al., 2008; Stevens et al., 2008). 446 Task-related modulation of functional connectivity of lateral PFC is critical for suppressing task-447 irrelevant processing in the brain (Zanto et al., 2011), which is reduced in older adults compared 448 to young adults (Gazzaley et al., 2005). Moreover, task-related functional connectivity of the left 449 lateral PFC with DMN regions specifically has been associated with memory failure in older 450 adults due to an inability to ignore distraction (Stevens et al., 2008). The latter is consistent with 451 research demonstrating that, unlike young adults, older adults \u201cfail to deactivate\u201d the DMN 452 during externally focussed cognition (Grady et al., 2006; Lustig et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2008), 453 and that this failure is associated with persistent functional connectivity of the DMN with the 454 FPCN (Spreng and Schacter, 2012; Spreng and Turner, 2019; Turner and Spreng, 2015). Taken 455 together, these results suggest that lateral PFC regions involved in cognitive control play a role in 456 age-related differences in selective attention due to 1) reduced dynamic flexibility of functional 457 connectivity with other brain regions/networks generally, and 2) persistent functional 458 connectivity with the DMN, specifically. These task-related differences in older adults mirror 459\nage-related differences in intrinsic RSFC (Grady et al., 2016; Spreng et al., 2018), demonstrated 460 most prominently by the monolingual older adults in this study, who showed lower cross-461 network RSFC of a connector node of the FPCN, and stronger RSFC of a hub node of the FPCN 462 with the DMN. Previous work demonstrated that age-related differences in functional 463 connectivity of the FPCN with other networks during both task and rest predicted cognitive 464 performance (Grady et al., 2016). Thus, the differences reported here between monolingual and 465 bilingual older adults in cross-network RSFC of two key nodes of the FPCN (aMFG and pMFG) 466 could account for the preservation of cognitive function in bilinguals in the face of more 467 advanced neuroanatomical aging, relative to monolinguals. 468 469 Younger looking patterns of RSFC in the bilingual older adults could be the consequence of a 470 long history of increased demand on the FPCN to facilitate attentional control. Metaphorically, 471 just as targeted physical exercise builds specific muscles of the body needed to optimize physical 472 performance over time, \u201cmental exercise\u201d may strengthen RSFC among specific brain regions 473 needed to optimize cognitive performance. Experience-dependent changes in RSFC are highly 474 specific to the brain regions engaged during task performance (Albert et al., 2009; Lewis et al., 475 2009; Stevens et al., 2010; Tambini et al., 2010). Further, the magnitude of experience-476 dependent changes in RSFC predicts the degree of improvement in future task performance 477 (Lewis et al., 2009; Stevens et al., 2010; Tambini et al., 2010). Thus, the pattern of preserved 478 RSFC of the FPCN hub and connector nodes in the brains of bilingual older adults is highly 479 consistent with the pattern of task-evoked activity that facilitates domain-general attentional 480 control, needed to cognitively manage multiple languages simultaneously. 481 482\nRecent work sought to identify a RSFC connectome associated with cognitive reserve using a 483 data-driven approach, which could be useful as a direct measure of cognitive reserve and a 484 potential outcome measure for interventions aimed at improving CR (Stern et al., 2021). The 485 pattern of RSFC identified was correlated with IQ, and notably, included primarily frontal brain 486 regions. Indeed, understanding the factors that give rise to CR and its underlying neural 487 mechanism(s) is an important endeavour, with broad implications ranging from the level of the 488 individual to society. For example, a recent large-scale longitudinal study demonstrated 489 relationships between educational attainment, RSFC of the brain\u2019s functional networks, and 490 neurocognitive health in older age (Chan et al., 2021). In general, older adults show reduced 491 within-network RSFC and increased between-network RSFC relative to young adults, reflecting 492 a widespread pattern of dedifferentiation [also referred to as reduced segregation (Wig, 2017)] of 493 functional network organization broadly (Chan et al., 2014; Geerligs et al., 2015; Grady et al., 494 2016; Setton et al., 2022; Spreng et al., 2016). This effect of aging is more prominent in older 495 adults without a college degree than their college-educated peers, and predicts impending 496 progression of dementia up to a decade later (Chan et al., 2021). 497 498 Our results are generally consistent with previous work described above reporting large-scale 499 network dedifferentiation in aging and widespread, somewhat non-specific differences in 500 patterns of RSFC associated with CR (e.g., education and IQ). Importantly, however, our results 501 further delineate the specific processes that lead to network-wide changes at the level of 502 individual network nodes, revealing their dissociable roles in maintaining within- and between-503 network communication in the context of a well-established CR factor \u2013 bilingualism. Notably, 504 the pattern of cross-network functional connectivity of MFG regions that was more prominent in 505\nbilingual older adults and correlated with second language proficiency in the current study is the 506 reverse of the pattern associated with the well-established shift from fluid to crystalized 507 cognition in typical aging (Spreng and Turner, 2019). Therefore, our findings highlight the 508 critical roles of specific brain regions \u2013 i.e., discrete nodes of the FPCN within the MFG \u2013 in 509 maintaining domain-general attentional control in aging, and suggest the intriguing possibility 510 that the pattern of RSFC of these regions associated with bilingualism could be a neural 511 mechanism underlying multiple CR factors. Understanding these factors is critical for informing 512 personal lifestyle choices and policy decisions in an increasingly older global population. 513 514 Materials and Methods 515 Participants 516 Ninety-three participants (age: mean \u00b1 SD = 74.04 \u00b1 3.86, range = 68-85; 63 female) were 517 recruited from the local area surrounding Toronto, Ontario, Canada; each participant was a 518 resident of Canada at the time of testing. All participants were right-handed and had no history of 519 heart disease, neurological or psychological disorders, or traumatic brain injuries. Data from a 520 subset of these participants were analyzed in previous work (Anderson et al., 2021; John A.E. 521 Anderson et al., 2018). An additional 3 participants were recruited but to ensure data quality, 522 these participants were excluded from analyses due to head motion in the MRI scanner 523 exceeding 3mm in one or both of the resting-state fMRI runs. 524 525 The Language and Social Background Questionnaire [LSBQ (John A. E. Anderson et al., 2018)] 526 was used to categorize participants as monolingual or bilingual. Participants were interviewed 527 via telephone to validate bilingual status, and those who could not be reliably identified as either 528\nmonolingual or bilingual were not included in the study. Of the 93 participants analyzed, 47 529 participants (29 female) were identified as bilingual and 46 (34 female) were identified as 530 monolinguals. All participants completed the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE (Folstein 531 et al., 1975)] and D-KEFS battery (Delis et al., 2001). The D-KEFS is a well-established battery 532 that assesses a comprehensive variety of cognitive processes related to executive control. 533 534 Propensity Score Matching 535 Interpreting group differences in brain structure and function related to cognitive reserve requires 536 that monolingual and bilingual groups have an equivalent level of cognitive functioning. 537 Therefore, in the current study, monolinguals and bilinguals were matched on multiple 538 neuropsychological and demographic variables using propensity-score matching (PSM). A 539 propensity score for each individual was obtained by using logistic regression to predict group 540 membership given a set of observed covariates. Participants from one group were then matched 541 to those in the second group based on the propensity scores (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). 542 Nearest neighbour matching was used to match the propensity scores of individuals between 543 groups. PSM accounts for multivariate interaction, minimizes selection error when using a large 544 number of matching variables, and is well-suited for smaller sample sizes that are usually found 545 in neuroimaging studies (Austin and Steyerberg, 2015; Ho et al., 2007; Rosenbaum and Rubin, 546 1983). 547 548 To prioritize matching the monolingual and bilingual groups on cognitive performance, PSM 549 was done using the MatchIt R package (Ho et al., 2011) in a 2-stage hierarchical manner. The 550 first level matched the groups on 4 neuropsychological measures: MMSE, Trail Making Task 551\n(letter-number-switching score), Shipley-2 verbal score, and Shipley-2 block patterns score 552 Using the propensity scores, each bilingual participant was matched to a monolingual; bilinguals 553 that could not be matched, and any remaining monolinguals, were removed from the matched-554 group analyses. Once the groups were matched on cognitive performance, they were then 555 matched on 3 demographic variables using the same procedure: age, education, and sex. The 556 final group sizes were 39 monolinguals (age: mean \u00b1 SD = 73.51 \u00b1 3.25, range = 68-79; 30 557 female) and 39 bilinguals (age: mean \u00b1 SD = 73.87 \u00b1 4.00, range = 69-83; 23 female). 558 559 MRI Data Acquisition 560 MRI data were collected in Toronto, Ontario, Canada at York University using a Siemens Trio 561 3T scanner with a 32-channel head coil. For each participant, a high-resolution T1-weighted 562 anatomical scan was acquired (TR = 1.9 s, TE = 2.52 ms, 192 axial slices, slice thickness = 1 563 mm, field of view (FOV) = 256 mm, 256 x 256 acquisition matrix). After the anatomical scan, 564 participants completed two six-minute, multi-echo \u201cresting-state\u201d functional scans, wherein 565 participants were instructed to remain still in the scanner while visual maintaining fixation on a 566 cross (TR = 3 s, TE= 14 ms, 30 ms, 46 ms, flip angle = 83\u00b0, 43 axial slices, FOV = 216 mm, 567 voxel size = 3 mm isotropic). 568 569 Voxel-Based Morphometry 570 To assess differences in grey matter integrity, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was conducted 571 using the FSL-VBM software suite (Douaud et al., 2007; Smith et al., 2004). T1-weighted 572 structural images were brain-extracted (BET) to remove skull. Next, tissue-type segmentation 573 was conducted (FAST4) to quantify grey matter density at the voxel-wise level across the whole 574\nbrain for each participant. Grey matter images were normalized to a study-specific grey matter 575 template through a two-step process. First, all grey matter volume images were non-linearly 576 aligned to the MNI_152 grey matter template and averaged to create a study specific grey matter 577 template; second, the native-space grey matter image for each participant was non-linearly 578 aligned to the study specific template (FNIRT). The registered grey matter images were 579 corrected for local expansion or contraction (caused by the non-linear component of the spatial 580 transformation) by dividing by the Jacobian of the warp field. The modulated images were then 581 smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 3 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM). 582 Group differences in grey matter density were determined using voxel-wise t-tests (3dttest++) in 583 Analysis of Functional Neuroimages [AFNI (Cox, 1996)] with alpha < 0.05; correction for 584 multiple comparisons was done using the AFNI non-parametric equitable thresholding and 585 clustering (ETAC) method (Cox, 2019), with 10 voxel-wise p-thresholds ranging from p = 0.01 586 to p = 0.001. To calculate the correlation between second language proficiency and grey matter 587 density in the pCC across all participants (n = 93), a single significant cluster from the group 588 analysis was used as a ROI; mean grey matter probability across all voxels within this ROI was 589 calculated for each participant. 590 591 fMRI Data Preprocessing 592 Echo-planar images were preprocessed using the AFNI multi-echo independent component 593 analysis (ME-ICA) processing pipeline (DuPre et al., 2021; Kundu et al., 2013, 2012). For each 594 echo of both resting-state runs, any large transient spikes of activity were identified and removed 595 via interpolation (3dDespike). Data were then slice-time corrected (3dTshift) and aligned to the 596 initial volume (3dVolreg). ME-ICA (tedana) was conducted to further remove noise components 597\nrelated to motion and physiological artifacts (Kundu et al., 2013, 2012). The combination of 598 multi-echo fMRI and ME-ICA has been shown to be more effective at removing spurious noise 599 sources than conventional methods (Power et al., 2018). This denoising technique leverages the 600 TE-dependence of the transverse relaxation rate, R2*; almost all fMRI signal, regardless of 601 origin, can be expressed as some combination of R2*, and initial signal intensity, S0 (Wu and Li, 602 2005). All echoes are combined and analyzed using ICA to determine the degree to which 603 independent components were associated with R2* changes. Components highly associated with 604 R2* mechanisms were identified as BOLD signal components, whereas weakly associated 605 components were identified as noise and removed (Kundu et al., 2013, 2012) . The effectiveness 606 of ME-ICA denoising obviates the need for global signal regression (Spreng et al., 2019). Data 607 for each run were then smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel of 6 mm FWHM 608 (3dBlurInMask) and mean-scaled. Finally, the 2 scaled runs were concatenated and transformed 609 into a study specific MNI_152-template space (@auto_tlrc). 610 611 Resting-State Functional Connectivity 612 Coordinates for all nodes of the DMN, FPC, and DAN were obtained from a previous study that 613 identified and characterized these network-nodes based on both task-related and resting-state 614 fMRI data; nodes were assigned network labels corresponding to their \u201crest network affiliation\u201d 615 (Spreng et al., 2013). For each participant, nodes were defined by spherical regions of interest 616 (ROIs) with a radius of 6 mm centered on the a priori coordinates. To quantify resting-state 617 functional connectivity (RSFC), the mean BOLD signal time-series across all voxels within each 618 node was extracted and pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for all node-619 pairs and transformed to z-values using Fisher\u2019s r-to-z transformation. This yielded a 43 by 43 620\nnode-wise correlation matrix for each participant. Significant differences in RSFC between the 621 monolingual and bilingual groups were determined using permutation tests (1000 permutations) 622 for every node-pair and false discovery rate correction (threshold: q < 0.05, FDR corrected) for 623 multiple comparisons across the entire matrix. 624 625 Graph Theoretic Analysis 626 For each participant, a graph was constructed from the node-wise correlation matrix using the 627 GraphVar software suite (Kruschwitz et al., 2015). To account for potential threshold effects, we 628 calculated graph metrics across a series of network densities (density range = 0.22-0.4). Two 629 graph metrics were calculated and reported here: weighted local clustering coefficient and 630 betweenness centrality. The weighted clustering coefficient of a node quantifies how tightly 631 clustered a given node is with its immediate neighbours, while considering the weight of the 632 connections; it is calculated as the sum of the weights of all closed triplets centered on a node at 633 a given density, normalized by the sum of the weights of all possible triplets centered around that 634 node. The betweenness centrality of a node is the number of shortest paths between all possible 635 node-pairs that pass through the given node at a given density; betweenness centrality is a 636 measure of the extent to which a node contributes to communication across networks, and thus 637 can be used to identify main interconnector nodes (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). Both metrics 638 were normalized by calculating the mean area under the curve across the range of densities. 639 Significant group differences were determined using permutation tests (1000 permutations). 640 641 Brain-Behaviour Correlations 642\nPrevious behavioural research has implicated the active use and proficiency of a second language 643 as the critical factor having a positive effect on cognitive reserve (Calabria et al., 2020). Second 644 language proficiency was previously quantified from the LSBQ. A factor analysis on all the 645 LSBQ items identified a latent variable with clustered items representing second language 646 proficiency. The eigenvalue from this factor was used as a subscale of the LSBQ to quantify the 647 active use and proficiency of a second language (John A. E. Anderson et al., 2018). To determine 648 if second language proficiency is related to structural and functional brain properties, we used 649 Pearson correlation to quantify the relationship between second language proficiency and each of 650 our brain measures across the entire group of 93 participants (age: mean \u00b1 SD = 74.21 \u00b1 4.09, 651 range = 68-85; 65 female). Second language proficiency was correlated with each of the 652 following brain measures: PCC grey matter density, mean RSFC between the aMFG and the 6 653 DMN nodes identified in the group comparison of the full correlation matrix (dmPFC, pCC, left 654 IPL, left SFG, left STS, and vmPFC), clustering coefficient of the aMFG with the entire DMN, 655 and betweenness centrality of the pMFG. The significance of the Pearson correlation was 656 determined using two-tailed tests at alpha < 0.05. 657\nReferences 658 Abutalebi J, Della Rosa PA, Green DW, Hernandez M, Scifo P, Keim R, Cappa SF, Costa A. 659 2012.
