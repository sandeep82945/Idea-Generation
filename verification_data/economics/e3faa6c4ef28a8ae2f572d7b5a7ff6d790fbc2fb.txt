The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is:

"This study has several limitations. First, OS is recognised as a valid clinical endpoint for drug approval, but due to its novelty in several clinical trials, our framework points were partly based on the PFS as a surrogate benefit. Furthermore, we only obtained phase III RCTs existing as of 2023. Updated clinical data and post-approval clinical studies would lead to changes on efficacy over time, which would cause biases in subsequent analysis. Second, we only used data from oncology trials in the Chinese and Asian populations or multi-centre RCTs with a â‰¥25% proportion of the Chinese population. Moreover, some of the agents were only approved by NMPA and not be available in other countries, making them less generalisable. Third, we only analysed data on LC and BC, which have a high incidence and a significant proportion of drugs included in NRDL, and thus cannot conclude whether other solid tumours would have similar results. Finally, factors affecting the value of innovative drugs were multi-dimensional, while our assessment counted on disclosed trials, only taking the clinical benefit and cost into consideration, necessitating future studies."
