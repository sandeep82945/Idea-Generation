Based on the provided text, the sentences/portion of text where future research direction is mentioned are:

1. "We hope this work can provide some insights to the community and open up a new avenue for research in robust computer vision."
2. "Therefore, in this paper, we provide a detached object editing tool to conduct the model debugging from the perspective of object attribute and construct a dataset named ImageNet-E(diting)."
3. "It opens up new avenues for research in robust computer vision against object attributes."
4. "This suggests that improving robustness is still a challenging problem and the object attributes should be taken into account."
5. "We further discover ways for robustness enhancement from both preprocessing, network designing and training strategies."
6. "Limitations and future work. This paper proposes to edit the object attributes in terms of backgrounds, sizes, positions and directions."
7. "Therefore, a dataset like ImageNet-E is necessary for comprehensive evaluations on deep models."
8. "To validate that the evaluation on ImageNet (IN)-E can help to provide some insights for model’s applicability and enhancement, we conduct a toy example for model repairing."
9. "It can be observed that with the insights provided by the evaluation on ImageNet-E, one can explore the model’s attribute vulnerabilities and manage to repair the model and get a performance boost accordingly."
10. "In this paper, we put forward an image editing toolkit that can take control of object attributes smoothly. With this tool, we create a new dataset called ImageNet-E that can serve as a general dataset for benchmarking robustness against different object attributes."

These sentences indicate the areas where the authors suggest future research could be directed, focusing on enhancing robustness in computer vision through various means such as preprocessing, network design, training strategies, and further exploration of object attributes.
