INTRODUCTION\nThe emerging wireless power transfer technology promotes wireless powered networks (WPNs) where nodes are powered by energy access point to communicate with data access point [1]. In order to maintain continuous and uninterrupted information acquisition and transmission, reduce maintenance costs and improve energy efficiency, naturally it has become necessary to supply energy to WSN with environmental energy [2], [3]. Alternatively, the recent advance of radio frequency (RF) enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) provides an attractive solution to power wireless devices over the air. In addition to energy supply through ambient RF signals, an dedicated energy station can be proactively deployed to realize wireless energy transfer (WET) to supply the sensors, which breaks the restriction of passive collection of other\nenvironmental energy, with good controllability [4]. The wireless transmission of information accounts for most of the energy consumption of low-power sensor nodes. From the perspective of improving energy efficiency of information transmission for the wireless sensor nodes, wireless powered communication network (WPCN) has become a research hotspot in the academic community [5]. However, some key challenges still need to be addressed for the deployment of large-scale Internet of Things (IoT), since a large number of WSNs need to be deployed and maintained in various scenarios [6].\nDespite the technical advances made, it is still hard even impossible to maintain continuous information transmission for the sensor nodes of a WPCN due to the fading characteristic of wireless links. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology can realize intelligent customization of wireless communication environment, which opens up a new way to effectively improve the quality of wireless link [7]\u2013[10]. RIS can program the signal propagation of the wireless channel by intelligently controlling a large number of passive reflecting elements. RIS-aided wireless communication has received extensive research attention as it can reflect the incident signal with an adjustable phase shift, thereby modifying the radio waves, thus potentially presenting a new milestone in WPCN [11]. Introducing RIS into WPCNs is a relatively new research direction. The introduction of RIS can give full play to the advantages of RIS and improve the throughput performance of WPCNs [12]. In addition, using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) instead of traditional time division multiple access (TDMA) in WPCNs can further improve the throughput of the network [13].\nTo the best of our knowledge, no research work has yet investigated the design and optimization of energy and information beamforming in RIS-aided WPCN framework. Therefore, it is meaningful to study the impact of jointly energy and information beamforming for RIS-assisted WPCN systems. Specifically, we consider the problem of maximizing the achievable rate, where WET technology and NOMA technology are used to improve the performance of energy harvesting and information transmission. To solve the nonconvex optimization problem, a jointly iterative optimization and maximal ratio combining (MRC) algorithm is developed to obtain the maximum channel capacity. Moreover, the energy efficiency of the proposed method outperforms the conventional it is found that exploiting more user diversity is not always beneficial from the perspective of energy efficiency.\nII.

            "text": "We consider a multi-user NOMA-based downlink WPCN, which RIS is used to assist the power station (PS) for serving multiple users, as shown in Fig.1. The whole system consists of one power station (PS) with Ne > 1 uniform planar array (UPA) transmitting antennas, one access point (AP) with Ni > 1 UPA antennas, K information users (IUs) with one antenna and one RIS with M UPA reflecting units, denoted\nby K = {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , K} and M = {1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M}, respectively. Since the system we designed is a threedimensional (3D) MIMO system, it is more reasonable to use UPA with one more spatial degree of freedom than uniform linear array (ULA) to model the antenna here. Let HPR \u2208 CM\u00d7Ne ,HPA \u2208 CNi\u00d7Ne ,HRA \u2208 CNi\u00d7M , and HAR \u2208 CM\u00d7Ni represent baseband equivalent channels from PS to RIS, PS to AP, RIS to AP and AP to RIS, respectively. Meanwhile, h1,k \u2208 CM\u00d71, and h2,k \u2208 CNi\u00d71 represent the baseband equivalent channels from RIS to IUs and AP to IUs, respectively, \u2200k \u2208 K. In addition, we assume the channel state information (CSI) of all channels can be perfectly known.\nNext, we model the above channels. For a P \u00d7Q UPA antenna array, its array response can be expressed\nas\na(\u03c8, \u03b3) = ax(\u03c8, \u03b3)\u2297 ay(\u03b3) (1)\nax(\u03c8,\u03b3) = 1\u221a Q\n([ 1, ej\u03c0(sin\u03c8 sin\u03b3),. . . ,ej\u03c0(P\u22121) sin\u03c8 sin\u03b3 ])T (2)\nay(\u03b3) = 1\u221a P\n([ 1, ej\u03c0(cos \u03b3), . . . , ej\u03c0(Q\u22121) cos \u03b3 ])T (3)\nwhere \u03c8 and \u03b3 represent the horizontal angle and the elevation angle, respectively.\nFor all of above channels, we use the SalehValenzuela channel model that channel HPR can be expressed\nas:\nHPR= L\u2211 l=0 \u221a NeM L \u03b1laM,l ( \u03c8 (l) M , \u03b3 (l) M ) aHNe,l ( \u03c8 (l) Ne , \u03b3 (l) Ne ) (4a)\n\u03b1l = \u03b10 ( dl d0 )\u2212\u03b8 (4b)\nwhere l = 0 and l > 0 represents the line of sight (LoS) and non line of sight (NLoS) path, \u03b1l is plural channel gain for path l, \u03b10 is path fading at the reference distance d0, dl is the link distance, and \u03b8 is the path loss exponent. \u03c8(l)Ne and \u03b3 (l) Ne represent the horizontal angle and the elevation angle of the l path signal\nemitted by PS, and they represent the angle of departure (AoD) in HPR. Similarly, \u03c8 (l) M and \u03b3 (l) M correspond to the angle of arrival (AoA) in HPR. Other channels are built by similar methods.\nFor the energy harvesting link, the energy received at the AP can be expressed as:\nyAP\u2212PS = (HRA\u0398HPR +HPA)Gs+ n1, (5)\nwhere \u0398 = diag ( \u03b21e j\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b2Me j\u03b8M ) \u2208 CM\u00d7M denotes the reflection coefficients matrix of RIS. \u03b2m and \u03b8m denote the amplitude reflection coefficient and phase shift of the m-th reflecting element. Consider the reflecting element of the RIS is designed to maximize the reflected signal, thus \u03b2m = 1, \u2200m \u2208 M and only consider adjusting the phase \u03b8m of the RIS to maximize the reflected signal. G \u2208 CNe\u00d7Ne is the energy beamforming matrix of the PS. s \u2208 CNe\u00d71 is the transmission data symbol for PS and it is an independent identically distributed circular symmetric complex Gaussian random signal with zero mean and covariance\nE [ ssH ] = INt [45]. n1 \u223c CN (0, \u03b42) is the noise received at the AP.\nIn the information transmission link, the baseband transmitted signal of the AP can be expressed as:\nx = K\u2211 k=1 wkxk, \u2200k \u2208 K, (6)\nwhere wk \u2208 CNi\u00d71 is the information beamforming vector for the k-th IUs, xk \u223c CN (0, 1), k \u2208 K denotes the transmission data symbol for the k-th IU. x means that the beamforming information of K users is sent at the same time. So the information received at the k-th IU is:\nyIU,k\u2212AP = ( hH1,k\u0398HAR + h H 2,k ) K\u2211 j=1 wjxj + n2,k, \u2200k\u2208K (7)\nwhere n2,k \u223c CN (0, \u03b42) is the noise received at the k-th IU.\nIn this system, we only consider downlink information transmission. In conventional NOMA communication, when we use successive interference cancellation (SIC) demodulation technology at the IUs, the signal-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the k-th IU can be expressed as:\n\u0393k(w,G,\u0398)= \u2223\u2223(hH1,k\u0398HAR + hH2,k)wk\u2223\u22232\u2211 x(j)>x(k)\n\u2223\u2223(hH1,k\u0398HAR + hH2,k)wj\u2223\u22232+\u03b42 (8) where \u2200k\u2208K, and w\u2208CNi\u00d71 represents the information beamforming vector of every IUs.\n\u2223\u2223(hH1,k\u0398HAR + hH2,k)wk\u2223\u22232 is the received signal power in k-th IU and\n\u2211 x(j)>x(k) | (hH1,k\u0398HAR + hH2,k)wj| 2 is the interference power\nfrom other IUs.The SIC decoding order x(k) is depending by channal conditions from AP to the IUs. The better the channel conditions, the later the decoding order. x(k) = i denotes that the k-th IU is the i-th signal to be decoded at the receiver. So when x(j) > x(k), it means that x(j) demodulated after x(k), that is, it will cause interference to the k-th user. In other words, IUs will only be interfered by IUs with better communication channel condition. \u03b42 is noise power."

Before using the AO algorithm, the optimization function (10) can be further simplified. For the C5 constraint, \u03b8 is converted into the form of\nvector v = ( ej\u03b81 , . . . , ej\u03b8M ) . So \u0393k(w,G,\u0398) becomes \u0393k (w,b1,v).\nIn addition, the signal received at the k-th IU can be re-expressed as:( hH1,k\u0398HAR + h H 2,k ) wk = ( vR1,k + h H 2,k ) wk, (12)\nwhere R1,k = diag (h1,k)HAR. This form of formula (12) helps us to further optimize. At the same time, we define v\u0303 = [v, 1], R\u03031,k = [ R1,k,h H 2,k ]T.

(13) For the Frobenius norm of C1 constraint, it can be expanded into the following Eq.(14). It is assumed\nthat the signal is transmitted at the maximum power P0 allowed by the PS.\nR0 = HRA diag (HPRb1) ,\nT0 =  RH0 R0 RH0 HPAb1 (HPAb1) HR0 (HPAb1) H HPAb1  , P1 6 P0v\u0303T0v\u0303H\n(14)\nTherefore, the problem (10) can be transformed into:\nP0 : maxR(w, v\u0303) = K\u2211 k=1 log2 (1 + \u03c2k) ,\u2200k \u2208 K, (15a)\ns.t.

NUMERICAL RESULTS\nNumerical results verify the performance of our proposed ASS algorithm by jointly optimizing energy beamforming, information beamforming, and RIS phase shift matrix scheme for the multi-user system. We consider a three-dimensional (3D) Cartesian coordinate system, where the PS, RIS and AP placed on the buiding are located at (0 m, 0 m, 2 m), (0 m, 2 m, 2 m) and (2 m, 0 m, 0 m), respectively. And K = 4 IUs randomly distribute at the quarter circle with center (0 m, 0 m, 0 m), starting point (20 m, 0 m, 0 m) and ending point (0 m, 20 m, 0 m) with anti-clockwise. The following parameters will be used in the simulation. The number of PS antennas is Ne = 4. The number of AP antennas is Ni = 4. The number of reflecting units M in RIS is 9. The noise power is set as \u221270dBm and the transmission power P0 of PS are set as 20dBm. The corresponding path loss exponent \u03b8 between PS and RIS, PS and AP, and RIS and AP are all 2. While the corresponding path loss exponent \u03b8 between the IUs and the AP is 3.5. The convergence thresholds are set to 10\u22123. We make \u03b10 = \u221230dB, d0 = 1.\nFig.2 compare the change of average throughput with the increase of transmission power P0 in PS when M = 25. We can see that the average throughput of each algorithm increases gradually with the increase of transmission power. Compared with other conditions, our proposed ASS algorithm can obtain the best performance at any power. Moreover, with the increase of transmitting power, the distance between ASS algorithm and other conditions will become larger. This is because the ASS algorithm optimizes both\nenergy beamforming and information beamforming by adjusting the RIS phase shift, and makes a tradeoff between them to obtain the maximum system throughput. For the individual energy beamforming and information beamforming, one can only improve the collected energy, and the other can optimize information beamforming, so the maximum throughput can not be obtained naturally. As for the performance without RIS, it is always the worst. In addition, we improved M to 36 for further experiments. We can also observe that the throughput of the system will increase with the increase of the number of RIS reflecting elements.\nThen, we compare the effect of the RIS reflecting elements number M on average throughput in Fig.3. It can be seen that the average throughput performance of the proposed ASS algorithm, the information beamforming and the energy beamforming increases when the number of RIS reflecting elements increases. However, the condition without RIS has no effect because there is no RIS. In addition, the performance of proposed algorithm is about two times higher when the number of reflecting elements is only 4 than condition without RIS. RIS components are low cost passive devices, laying a large number of RIS components will not bring too much cost consumption. Therefore, it is worth noting that when the number of reflecting elements is increased to 36, the performance is even five times higher.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we proposed a robust beamforming scheme, which strikes a balance between the beamforming gain and the channel error, and the importance of exploiting both the passive beamforming of RIS and flexible deployment in designing multi-RIS assisted wireless communications. We formulated an WSM\nproblem that maximizes the beamforming gain and minimizes the channel estimation error at the same time. The closed-form FP method was employed to make the non-convex WSM problem. Furthermore, to alleviate the effects of the channel estimation error and RIS placement, the joint optimization of transmit/reflect beamforming, channel error and RIS placement algorithm was designed to overcome the channel uncertainty and RIS placement. The simulation results demonstrated that the developed approach is effective compared with conventional benchmark schemes.\nREFERENCES\n[1] C. Han, L. Chen, and W.
