1. **Investigate the relationship between ATIII levels and VTE in different subgroups of surgical patients.** This could include studies on patients with specific surgical conditions, such as trauma, HPB surgery, general surgery, and thoracic/vascular surgery. It would also be interesting to examine the relationship between ATIII levels and VTE in patients with different risk factors for VTE, such as obesity, age, and underlying coagulopathic conditions.


2. **Explore the mechanisms by which low ATIII levels contribute to VTE in surgical patients.** This could involve studies on the role of ATIII in the coagulation cascade, as well as studies on the effects of low ATIII levels on platelet activation, fibrinolysis, and other aspects of hemostasis.


3. **Develop and evaluate interventions to prevent VTE in surgical patients with low ATIII levels.** This could include studies on the use of prophylactic anticoagulants, such as heparin or warfarin, as well as studies on the use of ATIII replacement therapy.


4. **Investigate the relationship between ATIII levels and other outcomes in surgical patients, such as mortality, length of stay, and quality of life.** This could help to determine the overall impact of low ATIII levels on the health of surgical patients.


5. **Conduct a meta-analysis of studies on the relationship between ATIII levels and VTE in surgical patients.** This would help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the evidence on this topic and to identify areas where further research is needed.
