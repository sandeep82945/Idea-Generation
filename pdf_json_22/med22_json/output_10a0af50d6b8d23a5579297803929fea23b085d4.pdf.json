The complex life cycle of P. falciparum (Pf) between the 35 vertebrate human host and the anopheline vector results in differential expression of genes within 36 and between hosts. An in-depth understanding of Pf interaction with various human genes 37 through regulatory elements will pave way for identification of additional tool in the arsenal for 38 malaria control. Therefore, the regulatory elements (REs) involved in the over- or under-39 expression of various host immune genes hold a key to alternative control measures that can be 40 applied for prompt diagnosis and treatment. 41 Methods: We carried out an RNAseq analysis to identify differentially expressed genes and 42 network analysis of non-coding RNAs and target genes associated with immune response in 43 individuals with different clinical outcomes. Raw RNAseq datasets, retrieved for analyses 44 include individuals with severe (Gambia - 20), symptomatic (Burkina Faso - 15), asymptomatic 45 (Mali - 16) malaria as well as uninfected controls (Tanzania - 20; Mali - 36). 46 Results: Of the total 107 datasets retrieved, we identified 5534 differentially expressed genes 47 (DEGs) among disease and control groups. A peculiar pattern of DEGs was observed, with 48 individuals presenting with severe/symptomatic malaria having the highest and most diverse 49 upregulated genes, while a reverse phenomenon was recorded among the asymptomatic and 50 uninfected individuals. In addition, we identified 141 differentially expressed (DE) miRNA, of 51 which 78 and 63 were upregulated and downregulated respectively. Interactome analysis 52 revealed a moderate interaction between DEGs and miRNAs. Of all identified miRNA, five were 53 unique (hsa-mir-32, hsa-mir-25, hsa-mir-221, hsa-mir-29 and hsa-mir-148) because of their 54 connectivity to several genes, including hsa-mir-221 connected to 16 genes.

It also identified unique miRNAs and 59 lncRNAs that modify and/or regulate the expression of various immune genes. These regulatory 60 elements, we surmise have the potential to serve a diagnostic purpose in discriminating between 61 individuals with severe/symptomatic malaria and those with asymptomatic infection or 62 uninfected. 63\n64 Keywords: Plasmodium falciparum, severe, symptomatic, regulatory elements, network 65 interactome, RNAseq data, DEGs, miRNA, lncRNA, diagnostic potential 66\n67 Introduction 68 Malaria remains a huge cause of morbidity and mortality in many endemic regions burdened 69 with the infection especially sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 2021). The recent World Health Malaria 70 Report estimated about 241 million malaria cases and 627,000 deaths, and 95% of the cases and 71 deaths are from sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 2021). As a result of the growing threat of parasite 72 and vector resistance to antimalarial drug and insecticides (Abruquah et al., 2010; Adams et al., 73 2018; Alam et al., 2011; Awolola et al., 2018; Diallo et al., 2022; Fukuda et al., 2021; Hawkes et 74 al., 2015; Oboh et al., 2018; Patel et al., 2017; Straimer et al., 2022; Tacoli et al., 2016; Traor\u00e9 et 75 al., 2019; Tumwebaze et al., 2021), attention is now focused, more than ever on other control 76 measures that can be deployed for malaria control. Unfortunately, vaccine development has also 77 not been spared from parasite evasive mechanisms. Antigenic variations of different Plasmodium 78\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The only approved 80 malaria vaccine gives ~30% protection against malaria with multiple boosts (Gosling and von 81 Seidlein, 2016; Mvi and Gsk, 2015; The Lancet, 2021), thus requiring deeper understanding of 82 the parasite as well as appropriate host responses. 83\n84 P. falciparum parasite possesses a unique complex life cycle criss-crossing the human host, the 85 invertebrate mosquito vector and the pathogen (Mala et al., 2016; Wiser, 2009). Advancement of 86 this life cycle in the different host involves dynamic expression of genes involved in the parasite 87 and the human immune response (Adukpo et al., 2022; Beeson et al., 2016; Chappell et al., 2020; 88 Chen et al., 2014; Cowman et al., 2012; Crompton et al., 2014; Douglas et al., 2011; Duah et al., 89 2010; Ou\u00e9draogo et al., 2011; Tran et al., 2016). Hence, understanding the functional interaction 90 between humans and the parasite becomes pertinent to clarifying insights into the host-pathogen 91 interactome. The genomic architecture of the human host and parasite provides the unique 92 platform shaping host-pathogen interaction, and this communication is a selective force on the 93 host immune response and parasite evasive tactics (Awasthi and Das, 2013; Basu et al., 2013; 94 Duffy et al., 2018; Oboh et al., 2022). Therefore, understanding this interaction require an in-95 depth analysis of host-pathogen transcriptomic profile. Many studies have been designed to 96 understand parasite transcriptome/genome (Amambua-Ngwa et al., 2019; Tran et al., 2016), but 97 not much work has been done to decipher the transcriptome of the human host under an antigenic 98 assault. Current findings have shown the role of signaling and pathogen recognition receptors in 99\nimmune response to disease, however, the role of regulatory elements especially in Pf infection 100 is currently unknown.

Such regulatory players include 110 long non-coding RNAs, micro RNAs and transcription factors (TF). LncRNAs are a class of 111 non-coding transcripts, defined by a threshold of >200 nucleotides and found within or between 112 coding genes (Simantov et al., 2022). They have been implicated in regulating different 113 pathological and biological functions at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, and as such 114 influence host immune response (Morenikeji et al., 2021). MiRNA on the other hand are shorter 115 than lncNRAs, and attached to the 3\u2019-5\u2019 untranslated region and the coding arm of a messenger 116 RNA to modify gene expression, and ultimately protein products translated from modified genes 117 (Simantov et al., 2022). Early diagnosis of infection and quick intervention are key strategies in 118 malaria control. With an array of miRNA and lncRNA discoveries serving as biomarkers in 119 various disease conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and even infectious 120 pathogens (Morenikeji et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017; Yua et al., 2015), there is an increased 121 opportunity to add these regulatory elements (REs) to the arsenal for malaria control. Many 122 studies on malaria have attempted to correlate differential expression of these REs in individuals 123\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Multiple miRNA databases such as miRWalk 131 (Sticht et al., 2018), miRNet (Chang et al., 2020), and TargetScan (Agarwal et al., 2015) 132 compute potential miRNA-mRNA interactions, while the role of individual miRNA can be 133 inferred through functional analysis with Gene Ontology (GO) (Carbon et al., 2019). Similarly, 134 lncRNA prediction binding software including NONCODE (Bu et al., 2012), lncRNA2Target 135 (Jiang et al., 2015) and lncTar (Li et al., 2014) have been useful in guiding bench experiments. 136 Current algorithms, relying on base pair complementation, evolutionary conservation, and 137 thermodynamic stability of binding regions, have been shown to be useful in predicting miRNA, 138 lncRNA and TF binding sites on target genes (Carpenter et al., 2014; Popp et al., 2021; Wissink 139 et al., 2016). 140\n141 Therefore, we set out to carry out transcriptomic profiling to identify differentially expressed 142 genes in individuals with different malaria clinical conditions, identify lncRNAs and miRNA and 143 how these interact with immune genes 144\n145\n146\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The RNAseq datasets were obtained from individuals infected with 150 severe malaria (The Gambia; n=20), symptomatic (Burkina Faso; n=15), and asymptomatic 151 disease (Mali; n=16), in addition to uninfected controls (Tanzania; n=20; and Mali; n=36). All 152 libraries were paired-end reads with an average of 103 million reads (Table 1); RNAseq reads 153 ranging from 21 - 103 million reads. Data from studies that were not properly defined in terms of 154 infection status at the time of sample collection or for which status of malaria infection 155 (uninfected, asymptomatic, symptomatic and severe) was unknown were excluded from this 156 analysis. 157\n158 Gene expression analysis of RNAseq data 159 Low quality reads and any remaining adapters were trimmed off the RNAseq data, using 160 Trimmomatic version 0.38 (Bolger et al., 2014). Hisat2 version 2.2.1 was used to align quality 161 trimmed reads with the human (USCU hg38) reference genome (Kim et al., 2015). The resulting 162 bam files were used as input for constructing the gene counts using htseq-count version 0.9.1 163 (Anders et al., 2015) with the unstranded option and the annotated hg38 gene transfer format. 164 Gene expression analysis of generated gene counts mapping to the human genome was 165 performed using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) (Love et al., 2014). Resulting p-value were adjusted 166 using the Benjamin and Hochberg\u2019s approach for controlling false discovery rate. Genes with an 167 adjusted p-value of <0.05 found by DESeq2 were noted as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 168 involved in human response to the clinical manifestations of malaria.

Samples were clustered by the status of 171 infection (severe, symptomatic, asymptomatic and uninfected) and DEGs were visualized in a 172 heatmap. 173\n174 Functional and pathway analysis of human DEGs in clinical manifestations of malaria 175 Functional enrichment analysis of the topmost differentially expressed genes to determine the 176 molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components associated with these genes 177 was performed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery 178 (DAVID). With a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1, and a p-value of \u2264 0.05, molecular 179\nfunctions, biological processes and cellular components were catalogued. Generated pathways 180 were further confirmed using the iDEP (Ge et al., 2018) without altering the parameters. KEGG 181 programming algorithm was used to generate significant pathways with a p-value of \u2264 0.05 and 182\nFDR of 0.1. 183\n184 Differentially expressed miRNA prediction in different disease manifestations 185 miRNAs that were differentially expressed with a p-value of <0.05 and log fold change \u2265 2 were 186\ntaken to be upregulated while those with fold change of \u2264 -2 and a p-value of <0.05 were 187\ndownregulated.

To further locate the lncRNAs on the genome, the NONCODE database, which is a 200 robust repository for non-coding RNAs was used (Bu et al., 2012). Due to the huge size of non-201 coding RNAs in most vertebrate genomes, some assumptions were made to filter out any non-202 coding RNAs that might have even the slightest potential of coding for a particular protein. 203 These assumptions include a). lncRNA with more than two exons were selected based on the 204 presumption that high quality transcripts have high number of exons; b). transcripts length of \u2265 205\n200 bp were selected; c). non-coding potential prediction score using the coding-non-coding 206 index (CNCI) of < 0 was used to discriminate between lncRNAs with the ability to code from 207 those without such ability (Guo et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017) . All lncRNAs that met the 208 above three criteria were selected and a second validation done using the LGC toolkit found 209 among the suite of LnCBook package (Ma et al., 2019) that characterize and identify features of 210 lncRNA, including transcript length. The LnCbook collates lncRNAs from both pre-existing 211 databases and experimentally verified community-curated transcripts making it a reliable 212 database for determining the coding potential of lncRNAs. LncRNAs that were identified to have 213 coding potential by this toolkit were further dropped from the list. 214\n215\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

A unique pattern of expression was observed among the 220 different clinical definitions of disease: individuals with severe and symptomatic malaria from 221 Gambia and Burkina Faso had similar expression pattern, with similar genes observed to be 222 upregulated (e.g. UBB, TENTSC, HSP90AA1, FCGR3B, CYBB, SOD2 etc) and downregulated 223 (DCAF12, IFITM3, R3HDM4, CNN2, CFAP65, ATP283 etc). However, a reverse pattern was 224 observed among individuals with asymptomatic malaria infection or uninfected controls. Of 225 these, 3928 genes were upregulated in individuals with severe and symptomatic malaria, and 226 these genes were found downregulated in those with asymptomatic malaria or uninfected 227 individuals. Consequently, 1604 were observed to be upregulated in the asymptomatic or 228 uninfected individuals while being downregulated in the severe/symptomatic groups (Figure 2). 229 One hundred and thirty genes showed no change in their level of expression (Figure 1).

These miRNAs were found across all 238 human chromosomes except chromosome 21, which had no representation. Of these, 78 were 239 upregulated and 63 downregulated. Various biological processes including positive regulation of 240 cell cycle (adjusted p-value 0.00000153), negative regulation of protein metabolism (adjusted p-241 value 0.0000194), response to drug (adjusted p-value 0.00197) were identified (Figure 4a) in the 242 upregulated miRNA. Biological processes identified among the downregulated miRNA include 243 regulation of RNA metabolic process (adjusted p-value 0.000144), regulation of gene expression 244 (adjusted p-value 0.000201), regulation of transcription (adjusted p-value 0.000393), and cellular 245 response to extracellular stimulus (adjusted p-value 0.000951) (Figure 5a). Molecular functions 246 of upregulated miRNAs identified 25 functions including enzyme binding (adjusted p-value 247 0.0454), protein complex binding (adjusted p-value 0.0454) etc (Figure 4b). While 20 molecular 248 functions including neutral amino acid transmembrane transporter activity (adjusted p-value 249 0.00527) and RNA binding (adjusted p-value 0.0408) (Figure 5b) were identified among the 250 downregulated miRNAs. Of the 16 cellular components identified in miRNA that were 251 overexpressed, cytosol (adjusted p-value 0.000179), mitochondrial outer membrane (adjusted p-252 value 0.000837), nucleoplasm (adjusted p-value 0.000895) top the list (Figure 4c), while 253 ribonucleoprotein complex (adjusted p-value 0.0000549), nucleus (adjusted p-value 0.0309), 254 spliceosome complex (adjusted p-value 0.0467) were among the cellular components observed in 255 downregulated miRNAs (Figure 5c). 256 Of all identified miRNA, five stood out (hsa-mir-32, hsa-mir-25, hsa-mir-221, hsa-mir-29 and 257 hsa-mir-148), and were shown found to have multiple interactions with various genes. Of these 258 five, hsa-mir-221 had the highest connections to 16 genes, including DDIT4, ICAM1, CDKN1C, 259 p27, FOS etc. The second most connected miRNA is hsa-mir-29a with connections to 14 genes 260\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Furthermore, all of the five miRNAs, with the 262 exception of hsa-mir-32, interacted with multiple lncRNAs, such as hsa-mir-221 interacting with 263 RUNDC3A, TMEM147, FGDS, ARHGA27P1, hsa-mir-29a with STAG3L5P, MALAT1, hsa-264 mir-25 with NEAT1, LINC02275, and hsa-mir-148 with MMP25, XIST, ERVK13 (Figure 7). 265\n266 Characterization of identified lncRNA 267 A total of 608 lncRNA were identified to have various expression patterns, with 586 and 22 268 recorded to be upregulated and downregulated respectively. Applying further stringency reveal 269 only 522 and 14 lncRNAs to be upregulated and downregulated respectively (Supplementary 270 Table 1 and 2). The minimum number of exons found among the highly expressed lncRNA is 2, 271 while the maximum is 32, however, among the downregulated lncRNAs, the minimum exon is 2 272 and the maximum 6. Some of highly expressed lncRNAs such as SLC7A11 through interactions 273 with genes like CD43, CDK41, ZBTB47 were found to be involved in antigen-specific activation 274 of T cells, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, while LINC01524 is involved in 275 CD28 co-stimulation when it interacts with CD292, IRGQ, HOOK3, BRD4, AP1M1 genes 276 (Supplementary Table 1 and 2). 277\n278 Biological, molecular and cellular functions of the differentially expressed genes 279 The pathway analyses of the top 100 upregulated genes identified 68 biological processes 280 (Figure 8a), including axon guidance (p-value 2.52E-07), cell-cell adhesion (p-value 3.78E-05), 281 transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway (p-value 4.33E05), and 282 hemophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules (p-value 1.87E040).

Understanding how immune response genes and 310 regulatory factors impact clinical outcome in different disease classifications can potentially 311 unlock the key for new diagnostic biomarkers and druggable targets. 312\n313 We used a computational approach to elucidate differentially expressed genes and multi-omic 314 regulatory factors (miRNA and lncRNA) that are potentially contributory to disease outcome in 315 different types of clinical malaria from the perspective of the human host. We identified large 316 number of genes that were differentially expressed in the four clinical categories. Interestingly, 317 the severe and symptomatic disease categories showed similar expression patterns, with same 318 genes upregulated and downregulated in both groups. Among the upregulated genes, C-C motif 319 chemokine 11 (CCL11), one of chemokine genes clustered around chromosome 17 and 320 displaying chemotactic activity for eosinophils, as well as a participant in innate immune 321 response (Nazarinia et al., 2022), was the most upregulated. It is predicted to induce the 322 production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in microglia cells and mediating neutrophils 323 homing into damaged or infected areas, amplifying inflammatory response in the process 324 (Adzemovic et al., 2012). Possibly of most importance today, elevated plasma levels of CCL11 325 has been associated with severe COVID-19 cases in hospitalized patients (Nazarinia et al., 2022). 326 Another highly expressed gene observed is the mitochondrial RNR2L10 (mt-rnr2l10) gene, 327 which is involved in the regulation and execution of apoptotic cell death during inflammation 328 (Guo et al., 2003). Hence, we can surmise that these highly expressed genes in severe and 329\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This gene 334 alongside HBG1 are normally expressed in fetal liver, bone marrow and spleen and replaced by 335 adult hemoglobin (HbA) after birth (Pereira et al., 2015). Being linked to iron and oxygen 336 binding, it is important for effective transportation of oxygen via heme, thereby preventing and 337 reducing cell death. But in downregulated disease conditions as observed, cell death becomes 338 inevitable, hence the severity of disease. In this study, we did not identify the C6KTB7 or 339 C6KTD2 identified by others (Agamah et al., 2021) to be to be differentially expressed in 340 malaria patients. A possible reason for this could be difference in the demographics of 341 participants from whom the data were obtained as signatures of immune response is is shaped 342 partly by the array of pathogens in different geography that challenge individuals residing in 343 those areas. 344\n345 Of interest is the identification of several miRNAs that were either upregulated or downregulated 346 in our study. Five of the miRNAs - hsa-mir-32, hsa-mir-25, hsa-mir-221, hsa-mir-29 and hsa-347 mir-148 were peculiar in that they bind to different target genes and the possibility of regulating 348 their expression during infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is possibly the first report 349 identifying these five miRNAs as differentially expressed and regulating different host genes 350 such as CDK6, CD276, CDC42, DNMT3A, CXXC6 etc. CDK6 is known to phosphorylate and 351 regulate the expression of tumor suppressor proteins, and its altered expression has been 352\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

CD276 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of 354 proteins and participate in the regulation of T-cell-mediated immune response (Liu et al., 2021). 355 It is highly expressed, hence of no surprise that hsa-mir-29 binds to the 3\u2019UTR resulting in even 356 higher expression that ultimately leads to inflammatory response and cell death. However, a 357 study has found an inverse relationship between hsa-mir-29 and the expression of cytochrome 358 P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) gene (Yua et al., 2015), where hsa-mir-29 was reported to suppress the 359 expression of CYP2C19 gene. 360\n361 Substantial number of lncRNAs were also identified to be associated with disease. Of these, two 362 (SLC7A11 and LINC01524) were found to interact and stimulate several immune genes such as 363 CD43, CDK41, ZBTB47, CD292, IRGI etc which are known to be involved in antigen-specific 364 activation of T cells and regulation of transcription. 365\n366 Our pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes reveal several pathways such as cell-cell 367 adhesion, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, hemophilic cell 368 adhesion, protein binding, oxygen transport, hydrogen peroxidase catabolic process, cellular 369 oxidant detoxification, hemoglobin complex and haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex that were 370 enriched among the up-/downregulated genes. Multiple genes were identified to be involved in in 371 the different pathways. For example, EGFR, EPHAS, and ROS1 genes implicated in lung cancer 372 susceptibility (Ke et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2016) and were involved in positive 373 regulation of kinase activity, cell-cell adhesion etc. 374\n375\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Of these, SLC7A11, 376 LINC02275, ERICH3, LINC01120, FOXD2, LINC01816 were unique in the number of target 377 immune genes they bind from CD43, TNFRSF13B to CD292. Therefore, we proposed that these 378 lncRNAs could that have the ability to regulate the expression of these various genes and impact 379 their over-or under expression can be targeted as biomarkers for diagnostic purposes in 380 distinguishing the different forms of malaria infections. 381\n382 Evaluating the network connection between the DEGs and miRNA, differentially expressed 383 miRNAs and various genes and miRNAs and lncRNAs to appreciate the visual connection 384 between all revealed various interesting networks amongst the duplexes, for instance interaction 385 was observed between KMT2B/IDF2/TTYH3/NTRK2 genes and hsa-mir-331, 386 EGFR/MBD6/ZNF385A/TTYH3 and hsa-mir-24. The most connected miRNA is the hsa-mir-387 221 which was observed to target 16 genes including ICAM1, followed by the hsa-mir-29a 388 binding to 14 genes (including CD276, CDC42, and CXXC6). Similarly, these two miRNAs 389 were also found to be connected to several lncRNAs. Taken together, it is safe to propose that 390 these two miRNAs play significant role in human immune response to malaria and results in 391 different clinical outcomes. Therefore, since they modify and/or regulate the expression of these 392 genes and lncRNAs, targeting them for diagnostic purpose in discriminating individuals with 393 severe/symptomatic malaria from those with asymptomatic infection or not infected will provide 394 an added arsenal in the battle against malaria. 395\n396 This is a computational study utilizing RNAseq transcriptome data to decipher DEGS, miRNAs 397 and lncRNAs involved in malaria infection and how they modulate disease status and severity 398\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

NB: Genes that 745 were upregulated in individuals with severe and symptomatic malaria (3928) were 746 downregulated in those with asymptomatic malaria or individuals not infected. Consequently, 747 genes that were upregulated in asymptomatic malaria infected individuals or those with no 748 infection (1604) were downregulated in severe/asymptomatic malaria conditions. While 130 749 genes showed no change in the level of their expressions 750\n751\nFigure 2: Differentially expressed genes in individuals with various Plasmodium falciparum 752 clinical manifestations. Individuals with symptomatic and severe malaria showed similar patterns 753 of up/downregulated genes, and this pattern was reversed in those with asymptomatic or no 754 malaria infection.
