    "abstractText": "Different methods for galvanically isolated monitoring of the mains voltage waveform were evaluated. The aim was to determine the level of distortion of the output signal relative to the input signal and the suitability of each method for calculating active power values. Six fixtures were tested: two voltage transformers, an electronic circuit with a current transformer, a standalone current transformer, a simple circuit with optocouplers, and a circuit with an A/D-D/A converter with capacitive coupling. The input and output waveforms were mathematically analyzed by three methods: (1) calculating the spectral components of waveforms and the relative changes in their THD (total harmonic distortion) values, (2) determining the similarity of waveforms according to the size of the area bounded by the input and output waveform curves, and (3) determining the accuracy of the active power calculation based on the output waveform. The time difference in the zero crossing of the input and output signals was measured, and further calculations for the second and third method were performed on the zero-crossing time shift-corrected waveforms. Other aspects of selecting the appropriate type of monitoring element, such as power consumption or overall circuit complexity, were also evaluated.",

            "text": "The importance of renewable energy sources has been growing rapidly in recent years, and much effort has been devoted to increasing their efficiency [1]. Among alternative energy sources, small photovoltaic power plants on the roofs of houses operated by homeowners are becoming increasingly popular. In some cases, it makes sense for operators of these small PV systems to maximize their own solar energy consumption within the household rather than selling the unconsumed energy to the grid. A special device (PV wattrouter [2]) can be used to control the energy consumption of a household with a PV source and prevent possible energy overflows into the distribution network. This device monitors the instantaneous values of the active power supplied to or drawn from the grid and controls the household energy consumption, for example, by switching resistive appliances appropriately. When designing a new type of wattrouter, we came across the need to accurately record voltage and current waveforms in the network. For the monitoring of the current waveform, a lead-through current transformer proved to be suitable. This method also ensured galvanic isolation of the mains from the lowvoltage part of the current measuring circuit. To monitor the mains voltage waveform, it is necessary not only to reduce the mains voltage amplitude to a suitable value in the order of units of volts, but the low-voltage part of the circuit must also be galvanically isolated from the measured mains voltage for safety reasons. From a physical point of view, the galvanic isolation of the input signal corresponding to the mains voltage waveform can be implemented by several different methods with regard to the character of the transmitted signal. Since the monitored mains voltage waveform is AC, a transformer with\nSensors 2022, 22, 7769. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22207769 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 7769 2 of 20\ngalvanically isolated primary and secondary windings can be used. The signal transfer from input to output is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction. Another form of galvanically isolated signal transmission is optical transmission. The electrical input signal is converted by a suitable source into light, which after passing through an optical path is incident on a light detector, which converts the light signal into an electrical signal. An optocoupler with an LED [3] and a photodiode can be used to transmit the analogue signal [4]. Another optical method for measuring higher (AC) voltages uses the voltage-induced change in optical polarization in anisotropic crystals. A polarized beam of light passes through the crystal and the resulting polarization, determined by the magnitude of the voltage applied to the crystal, is detected by the sensor [5,6]. A capacitive coupling using a capacitor can be used for galvanically isolated information transfer. When properly connected, the capacitors block DC voltages and low frequency signals. Higher frequencies, which the capacitors passes, are used to transmit information. The waveform of the mains voltage with a first harmonic component at 50/60 Hz, together with possible higher harmonic components at multiple frequencies, is digitized, and the data transfer by capacitive coupling is carried out using a high frequency carrier signal. On the output side, the digital signal is converted back to an analogue waveform. A capacitive coaxial voltage probe (CVP) can also be used for non-contact voltage measurement in a conductor [7]. The analogue measuring instruments used until recently are being widely replaced by digital instruments. In some applications, simple data such as the effective value of the measured quantities are sufficient for others, more complex tasks are required. With the use of compact programmable microcontrollers, the application possibilities are greatly expanded. The input circuit of the above-mentioned device\u2014the wattrouter\u2014is an electronic wattmeter. The integrated microcontroller, after sampling several periods of mains voltage and current, calculates the instantaneous value of the active power supplied to/from the mains using an algorithm. The quality of the reproduction of the monitored waveforms can significantly affect the accuracy of the calculated power value. In terms of the accuracy requirements of the calculation, attention must be paid to the selection of suitable galvanically isolating elements/circuits, which can distort the input signal in various ways. Another factor that can adversely affect the quality of the signal waveform transmission is the increasing inharmonicity of the mains voltage. Since the mains voltage waveform with a fundamental harmonic component (50/60 Hz) is significantly distorted by a large number of higher harmonic components up to units of kHz [8,9], the frequency dependence of the transmission characteristics of some galvanically isolating elements/circuits can have a significant effect on the distortion of the output signal. In order to find a suitable element/circuit galvanically separating the measuring part of the wattmeter from the network, several representatives of different physical methods were selected. The most important parameter for comparison of the elements/circuits was the degree of distortion of the output signal with respect to the observed mains voltage waveform. However, attention was also paid to practical application aspects such as power consumption, circuit complexity and the level of unwanted components in the output signal."

HCPL-4562 integrated circuits with LED and photodiode connected to the transistor base were selected. However, the current output of the photodiode was used directly for the measurement. In order to process both positive and negative half wave of the input AC 230 V signal, the LEDs were connected antiparallel with common current limiting resistors. The antiparallel connection of the LEDs also ensured the limitation of the shutter voltage on the LEDs. The size of the input limiting resistors was chosen by the mean current of the LEDs corresponding to their nominal average forward current value of 12 mA. Each of the photodiodes was connected to its own reverse voltage source, and the bipolar output signal was read at the measuring resistor 20 k\u03a9. An operational amplifier connected as a voltage follower was inserted between the measuring resistor and the fixture output. The fixture with the optocouplers connected is shown in Figure 1e.

Due to the maximum mains voltage of around 325 V, the unmeasured area of the voltage waveform should represent only 0.3% of the entire range of values.

The output signals from the ZMPT current transformer and optocouplers were noisy, and the output signal for the AMC1211 isolated amplifier circuit was strongly affected by high-frequency sweeps repeating at a frequency of approximately 25 kHz.

The values determined by Equation (9) and reported in Table 5 were then compared.\nSensors 2022, 22, 7769 18 of 20\nThe smallest absolute values of error in the calculation of active power using the fixture output data were achieved with the AMC1211 isolated amplifier circuit. The transformer BV EI 305 2055 achieved only a slightly worse result. The small error of the result for the voltage transformer BV EI 305 2055 is the result of compensating the overestimation of the instantaneous power values in the first and third quarter of the signal period and the underestimation of the power in the second and fourth quarter of the period. Table 6 provides a summary of the calculated errors of the individual fixtures by all three methods and phase shift in the zero crossing of the output signal relative to the input signal. The power consumption of the input (high-voltage) parts of the circuits was determined and included in the table.\nBoth voltage transformers have an input consumption determined by their design. The input consumption of the assembled AC voltage sensor with ZMPT is determined by the size of the limiting resistor in series with the primary winding of the current transformer. For a fixture with a separate ZMPT current transformer, the value of the limiting resistor was chosen so that the effective input current was approximately halfway through its recommended range of 1\u20132 mA. The value of the power dissipation at the maximum allowed input current is then shown in brackets. In the case of the fixture with optocouplers, the limiting resistors set the nominal photodiode current, which is not allowed to be exceeded. The value of the power dissipation is therefore the same as the maximum value shown in brackets. For the fixture with an Amc1211 integrated circuit, the input power is determined by the choice of the total resistance of the input divider. This circuit needs also its own low-voltage power supply circuit on the input side, whose consumption will vary from type to type and is therefore not taken into account."

            "text": "Six different fixtures for mains voltage waveform monitoring with galvanically isolated output were compared. The following fixtures were tested: voltage transformers K-2803GCE-1FL and BV EI 305 2055, the ZMPT101B single-phase AC voltage sensor, standalone current transformer ZMPT101B, optocouplers HCPL-4562 and the AMC1211 isolated amplifier circuit. The selection of the appropriate element/circuit will be determined by the requirements of the application. In terms of accurate reproduction of the mains voltage waveform, less than 2% error was achieved by fixtures with a ZMPT stand-alone current transformer, a pair of optocouplers and an AMC1211 AD/DA converter. In terms of the accuracy of the active power calculation, fixtures with a ZMPT standalone current transformer and a pair of optocouplers achieved errors of less than 2% and\nSensors 2022, 22, 7769 19 of 20\nfixtures with a BV EI 305 2055 voltage transformer and an AMC1211 AD/DA converter achieved errors of less than 1%. The K-2803GCE-1FL voltage transformer proved to be unsuitable in terms of output signal distortion, unlike voltage transformer BV EI 305 2055, as the second representative of the electromagnetic galvanic isolation principle of similar design and basic parameters. In principle, the voltage transformer is suitable for monitoring the mains voltage, but care must be taken in selecting its specific type. Especially in small applications, the energy consumption of the type of separating element/circuit can play an important role. Most suitable elements tested had a maximum power consumption on the mains side of approximately 1 W, the exception of the tested fixtures being the circuit with optocouplers. However, this circuit can be implemented with input-side power consumption less than 1 W, but signal reproduction accuracies for smaller input currents were not determined in this paper. The fixture with the AMC1211 AD/DA converter had the lowest power consumption on the mains side, but it needs a separate power supply for the high-voltage part of the circuit. The fixture with an AMC1211 AD/DA converter performed well in terms of signal distortion evaluation by all methods used, but it is a more complex circuit. It turned out that the tested circuit was also not very robust to interference, its output was noisier, and the circuit would need to be further modified. The second, more complex circuit tested was an AC voltage sensor with a ZMPT 101B current transformer. This circuit is industrially manufactured and could provide a cheap complete solution for monitoring mains voltage, but it did not achieve sufficient accuracy in reproducing the input signal, probably due to high THDu. The other tested fixtures consisted basically only of a galvanic isolation module and voltage dividers; the operational amplifier connected as a voltage follower was used only for the needs of reading the output signal waveform using an AD converter in a circuit with optocouplers. The voltage and current transformers did not need any additional power supplies to obtain the output bipolar signal. The single-channel bipolar output of the optocoupler pair circuit required two independent low-voltage DC sources. The circuit with optocouplers can be implemented as a two-channel with one source common to both channels. For some fixtures, the zero-crossing time difference between the input and output signals was detected. This parameter, however, was not a determining factor in the evaluation of signal distortion, as it was assumed that its value was in-variant and could be used for mathematical phase correction of the output waveform during signal processing. The need for this computational correction could be limiting for some applications, and methods with little phase shift (ZMPT stand-alone current transformer) or no phase shift (optocouplers, AMC1211 AD/DA converter) would be more suitable. The first method of evaluating the output signal distortion was the comparison of the relative change in total harmonic distortion of the voltage waveforms (THDu). It turned out that the result can be strongly influenced by the fact that the input signal is not purely harmonic, but is more or less distorted by a large number of harmonic components. The THDu of the network, caused mainly by connected non-linear loads, fluctuates over time, and the frequency spectrum of the monitored voltage can change strongly. The frequency dependence of the tested elements/circuits and the effect of the THDu change on the accuracy of the required measurement outputs should also be determined, but this was not investigated in this work.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.H. and P.K.; methodology, M.H.; software, P.K.; validation, M.L. and V.P.; formal analysis, P.K.; investigation, M.H.; resources, P.K.; data curation, V.P.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.H.; writing\u2014review and editing, P.K.; visualization, P.K.; supervision, M.L.; project administration, V.P.; funding acquisition, M.H.
