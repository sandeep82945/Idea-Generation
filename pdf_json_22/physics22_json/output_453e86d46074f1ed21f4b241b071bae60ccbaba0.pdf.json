    "abstractText": "Simulated quantum annealing is a generic classical protocol to simulate some aspects of quantum annealing and is sometimes regarded as a classical alternative to quantum annealing in finding the ground state of a classical Ising model. We derive a generic condition for simulated quantum annealing to converge to thermal equilibrium at a given, typically low, temperature. Both closed and open systems are treated. We rewrite the classical master equation for simulated quantum annealing into an imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation, to which we apply the imaginary-time variant of the asymptotic adiabatic condition to deduce the convergence condition. The result agrees qualitatively with a rigorous convergence condition of simulated quantum annealing for closed systems, which was derived from the theory of inhomogeneous Markov processes. Also observed is qualitative agreement with a rigorous convergence condition of quantum annealing for closed systems under the real-time Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics. This coincidence of convergence conditions for classical stochastic processes for simulated quantum annealing and the real-time quantum dynamics for quantum annealing is highly nontrivial and calls for further scrutiny.",

We derive a generic condition for simulated quantum annealing to converge to thermal equilibrium at a given, typically low, temperature. Both closed and open systems are treated. We rewrite the classical master equation for simulated quantum annealing into an imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation, to which we apply the imaginary-time variant of the asymptotic adiabatic condition to deduce the convergence condition. The result agrees qualitatively with a rigorous convergence condition of simulated quantum annealing for closed systems, which was derived from the theory of inhomogeneous Markov processes. Also observed is qualitative agreement with a rigorous convergence condition of quantum annealing for closed systems under the real-time Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics. This coincidence of convergence conditions for classical stochastic processes for simulated quantum annealing and the real-time quantum dynamics for quantum annealing is highly nontrivial and calls for further scrutiny.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevA.106.062614\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQuantum annealing (QA) is a metaheuristic, a generic approximate algorithm, for combinatorial optimization problems [1\u20138]. Recent years have seen its developments toward applications to a broader class of problems beyond combinatorial optimization such as quantum simulations [9\u201316] and optimization with continuous variables [17\u201320].\nThe classical algorithm of simulated quantum annealing (SQA) has often been used to simulate some properties of quantum annealing [3,21,22] and shares the ultimate goal with QA to find the ground state of a classical Ising model. SQA uses stochastic processes to statistically sample the finite, typically very low (and ideally zero), temperature equilibrium state of the transverse-field Ising model written as a classical Ising model by the Suzuki-Trotter formula [23]. SQA is not designed to reproduce dynamical properties of QA as the former follows classical stochastic processes and the latter is realized by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which are fundamentally different processes. This point is clear also from the fact that the Suzuki-Trotter formula is derived by\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

It is therefore natural to ask how slow is slow enough for this expectation to stay valid. Equivalently, we may ask under what conditions on the time dependence of parameters will SQA successfully reach thermal equilibrium.\nThis question has, indeed, been answered for generic closed systems, i.e., systems isolated from the environment [24], where the theory of an inhomogeneous Markov process was used to analyze the stochastic process under SQA [5,25]. It has been shown that a generic condition for convergence to a finite-temperature equilibrium state looks qualitatively similar to the corresponding generic convergence condition of QA for the transverse-field Ising model with time-dependent coefficients evolving under the real-time Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics. More precisely, in both cases of QA and SQA, the coefficient of the transverse-field term should be decreased by a power law of time in the long-time limit with the power inversely proportional to the system size. This apparent qualitative coincidence of convergence conditions for completely different dynamics is highly nontrivial, and it should be useful to provide a different perspective on this problem. Also from the technical point of view, the proof provided in Refs. [5,25] is\n2469-9926/2022/106(6)/062614(9) 062614-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nrather abstract, and it is not easy to extract relevant physics from it.\nTo mention a few related studies, Refs. [26,27] studied the quantum dynamics of open systems, and Ref. [28] discussed the relaxation time of time-independent models. Although not directly relevant to the present study, those papers represent interesting developments from the general perspective of dynamical properties of QA or SQA.\nThe present paper represents part of the efforts to meet the above-mentioned goal concerning convergence conditions by deriving a condition of convergence of SQA for closed and open systems based on an approximate, but asymptotically accurate, adiabatic condition for the imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The classical stochastic dynamics of SQA following the master equation is transformed to the imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation through a wellestablished prescription [29] (see also Refs. [30,31]). Then the leading-order term of the asymptotic expansion of the adiabatic condition for the imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics is used to derive our conclusion on the rate of time development of a coefficient. The logic is not completely rigorous mathematically because higher-order terms of the asymptotic expansion are ignored. Nevertheless, it turns out that the resulting convergence condition is in qualitative agreement with the corresponding rigorous condition derived from the theory of inhomogeneous Markov processes for closed systems [25].\nThis paper is structured as follows: In Sec. II, we derive the imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation from the classical master equation for the time-dependent transverse-field Ising model. In Sec. III, we deduce a condition for SQA to converge to a thermal equilibrium state by applying the imaginarytime variant of the adiabatic condition. Based on the result, in Sec. III, we derive a condition on the coefficient of the transverse field that ensures the convergence to a thermal equilibrium state in Sec. IV. This is a central result of this paper. We discuss the result and conclude the paper in Sec. V."

We use the notation W\u0302 to denote the transition matrix of size 2N whose entries are (W\u0302 )\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 = W\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 . An off-diagonal entry of the matrix W\u0302 can be written as [29]\nW\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 = w\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032e\u2212 12 \u03b2[H0(\u03c3 )\u2212H0(\u03c3 \u2032 )] (\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2032), (2)\nwhere \u03b2 is the inverse temperature and H0(\u03c3 ) is the Hamiltonian of the Ising model under consideration.

(4)\nB. Imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation for SQA\nFor simplicity of presentation, we first analyze the case of closed systems, i.e., systems described solely by the classical representation of the transverse-field Ising model at finite temperature to be defined below. Generalization to open systems is relatively straightforward and will be discussed in a later section.\nThe Hamiltonian of the transverse-field Ising model for QA is\nH (t ) = HIsing + HTF(t ), (5) where HIsing denotes the Hamiltonian of the Ising model,\nHIsing = \u2212 \u2211 \u3008 j j\u2032\u3009 Jj j\u2032 \u03c3 z j \u03c3 z j\u2032 , (6)\nwith \u3008 j j\u2032\u3009 for pairs of interacting spins, and HTF(t ) is for the transverse field with a time-dependent coefficient:\nHTF(t ) = \u2212 (t ) N\u2211\nj=1 \u03c3 xj . (7)\nHere, \u03c3 zj and \u03c3 x j are the z and x components of the Pauli matrix at site j, respectively. SQA runs Markov-chain Monte Carlo steps for the transverse-field Ising model rewritten as the corresponding classical Ising model derived by the Suzuki-Trotter formula [23] with the Hamiltonian\n\u03b2H0(\u03c3 )\n= \u2212 M\u2211\nk=1\n\u239b \u239d\u2211\n\u3008 j j\u2032\u3009\n\u03b2Jj j\u2032\nM \u03c3\n(k) j \u03c3 (k) j\u2032 + N\u2211 j=1 \u03b3 (t )\u03c3 (k)j \u03c3 (k+1) j\n\u239e \u23a0, (8)\nwhere M is the total number of Trotter slices running from k = 1 to M and the time-dependent coefficient of the second term \u03b3 (t ) is given by\n\u03b3 (t ) = 1 2 ln\n( coth \u03b2 (t )\nM\n) . (9)\nIn Eq. (8), \u03c3 (k)j (= \u00b11) is used to denote a classical Ising spin at the jth site on the kth Trotter slice. Notice that Eq. (8) has been derived with (t ) regarded as a fixed parameter as can be understood from the fact that the Suzuki-Trotter formula treats the equilibrium partition function.\n062614-2\nIn SQA, \u03b2 and M are both kept constant at large values, with \u03b2/M typically chosen to be of order unity, in order to reproduce the zero-temperature properties of the original transverse-field Ising model as faithfully as possible. Only the coefficient (t ) [and thus \u03b3 (t )] changes with time t . It is important to notice here that the dynamics of SQA with time-dependent parameters is driven by the classical stochastic process of Monte Carlo simulation, which is completely different from the original (zero-temperature) quantum dynamics of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the transverse-field Ising model of Eq. (5). One should not expect that the dynamical, i.e., transient, properties of the original quantum system of Eq. (5) can be reproduced by the classical method of SQA [33]. Nevertheless, QA and SQA share the goal to find, in the long-time limit t \u2192 \u221e, the ground state of the classical Ising model of Eq. (6) by tuning the parameter (t ) appropriately as a function of time t . The following discussions are for a condition for SQA with a time-dependent parameter to converge to a thermal equilibrium state at given finite values of \u03b2 and M in the long-time limit, which is different from a thermal relaxation process in a system with time-independent parameters.\nThe results deduced in this paper hold for any (real and positive) value of \u03b2. However, for practical applications of the results to a closed system, we are mainly interested in the limit at which \u03b2 is chosen to be very large.\nLet us rewrite the classical master equation for SQA in terms of an imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The quantum Hamiltonian dictating the latter equation, H\u0302 , can be constructed from the transition matrix W\u0302 as [29]\nH\u0302 := \u2212e \u03b2H\u030202 W\u0302 e \u2212\u03b2H\u030202 . (10) In Eq. (10), H\u03020 is used to represent a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are (H\u03020)\u03c3\u03c3 = H0(\u03c3 ).\nThe quantum Hamiltonian has the following explicit expression: H\u0302 = \u2211\n\u03c3 \u2211 \u03c3 \u2032 w\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 (e \u2212 12 \u03b2[H0(\u03c3 \u2032 )\u2212H0(\u03c3 )] |\u03c3 \u3009 \u3008\u03c3 | \u2212 |\u03c3 \u2032\u3009 \u3008\u03c3 |). (11)\nSince the configurations \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u2032 differ only at a single site, the jth site on the kth Trotter slice, the difference \u03b2H0(\u03c3 \u2032) \u2212 \u03b2H0(\u03c3 ) is given by the following expression, owing to expression (8) for the Hamiltonian H0:\n\u03b2H0(\u03c3 \u2032) \u2212 \u03b2H0(\u03c3 ) = 2\u03b2\nM \u2211 j\u2032 (n.n. j) Jj j\u2032\u03c3 (k) j \u03c3 (k) j\u2032\n+ 2\u03b3 (t )\u03c3 (k)j ( \u03c3 (k+1) j + \u03c3 (k\u22121)j ) .\n(12)\nThe summation symbol on the right-hand side expresses the sum over sites j\u2032 that are interacting with j. For notational simplicity, we denote the difference (12) by \u22122\u03b2Hj,k :\n\u2212 \u03b2Hj,k := \u03b2\nM \u2211 j\u2032 (n.n. j) Jj j\u2032\u03c3 (k) j \u03c3 (k) j\u2032 + \u03b3 (t )\u03c3 (k)j ( \u03c3 (k+1) j + \u03c3 (k\u22121)j ) .\n(13)\nUtilizing the introduced notation, the diagonal coefficient in Eq. (11) can be rewritten as\nw\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032e \u2212 12 \u03b2[H0(\u03c3 \u2032 )\u2212H0(\u03c3 )] = e\n\u03b2Hj,k\ne\u03b2Hj,k + e\u2212\u03b2Hj,k . (14)\nSimilarly, the off-diagonal coefficient in Eq. (11) is\nw\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 = 1 e\u03b2Hj,k + e\u2212\u03b2Hj,k . (15)\nUsing a matrix-vector notation, the master equation (1) can be rewritten as follows:\ndP\u0302(t )\ndt = W\u0302 (t )P\u0302(t ), (16)\nwhere P\u0302(t ) denotes a vector whose \u03c3 th entry (P\u0302(t ))\u03c3 is P\u03c3 (t ): [P\u0302(t )]\u03c3 = P\u03c3 (t ).\nIf we define\n|\u03c6(t )\u3009 := e 12 \u03b2H\u03020 P\u0302(t ), (17) it is straightforward to confirm that the master equation (16) is rewritten as the following imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation [29]:\n\u2212d |\u03c6(t )\u3009 dt\n= (\nH\u0302 (t ) \u2212 1 2 d dt (\u03b2H\u03020)\n) |\u03c6(t )\u3009 . (18)\nIn the long-time limit, time dependence in the Hamiltonian H\u03020 becomes arbitrarily small as (t ) gradually approaches zero, and the expression in the outer parentheses in the above equation approaches H\u0302 (t ). In this limit, the ground state of the Hamiltonian H\u0302 (t ) corresponds to the equilibrium state of the master equation (16), as shown in Ref. [29].\nWe apply the adiabatic condition [5] to the imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation of Eq. (18) to deduce the convergence condition for SQA.\nIII. IMAGINARY-TIME VARIANT"

Then, s is used for a dimensionless time scaled by \u03c4 , i.e., s = t/\u03c4 . We write the Hamiltonian of a generic quantum system as H(t ). We have in mind the quantity in the large parentheses on the right-hand side of Eq. (18) for H(t ), as will be discussed later. We assume that the instantaneous ground state of H(t ) is nondegenerate. This is justified in the present system, which is time evolving following Eq. (18), because the quantity in the large parentheses on the right-hand side of Eq. (18) is the Hamiltonian of a transverse-field Ising model with nonvanishing off-diagonal elements only between those states different by a single-spin flip (and thus expressed by \u03c3 xi ), to which the Perron-Frobenius theorem [34] applies [35]. Notice that this transverse-field Ising model defined in terms of H\u0302 in Eq. (11) and d (\u03b2H\u03020)/dt is different from the original model (5).\n062614-3\nWe define H(s) as\nH(s) := H(t ).

(20) j (s) is used to denote the instantaneous energy gap between the jth excited state and the ground state, j (s) = j (s) \u2212 0(s). The instantaneous energy gap between the first excited state and the ground state is particularly written as (s), i.e., (s) = 1(s) \u2212 0(s).\nA variant of the adiabatic condition for the imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation obtained in Ref. [5] states the following: For the state vector\n|\u03c8 (s)\u3009 = \u2211\nj\nc j (s) | j(s)\u3009 (21)\nof the imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\n\u2212 1 \u03c4 d |\u03c8 (s)\u3009 ds = H(s) |\u03c8 (s)\u3009 , (22)\nthe coefficient c j (s) with j = 0 has a large-\u03c4 asymptotic expansion as\nc j =0(s) \u2248 1 \u03c4 \u3008 j(s)| dH(s)ds |0(s)\u3009 j (s)2 + O(\u03c4\u22122). (23)\nThe first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (23), the first-order term in the asymptotic expansion from the limit of large \u03c4 , should be sufficiently small for the system to be close to the instantaneous ground state |0(s)\u3009. Since we ignore the second- and higher-order terms, our theory is approximate but is, nevertheless, expected to be accurate in the asymptotic limit of large \u03c4 .\nIn terms of the original time variable t , the adiabatic condition can be written as\n| \u3008 j(t )| dH(t )dt |0(t )\u3009 | j (t )2\n1 (24)\nfor j = 0.

(34)\nFinding a lower bound of the energy gap (t ) between the first excited state and the ground state is a nontrivial step. The coefficient of the transverse field in the quantum Hamiltonian (11) is w\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 . We start from the following inequality for the coefficient w\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 :\nw\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 = 1 e\u03b2Hj,k + e\u2212\u03b2Hj,k\n1\n2 e|\u03b2Hj,k | .

(38) From these relations, we learn that the coefficient w\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 has the lower bound\nw\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 1\n2 e\u03b2p(M )+2\u03b3 (t ) . (39)\nFor a generic transverse-field Ising model, a lower bound of the energy gap (t ) between the ground state and the first excited stated was deduced in Refs. [5,36,37]. Applying the argument given in those references to the model under discussion, we obtain the following relation:\n(t ) A(N ) (w\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 )N , (40) where the N dependence of A(N ) is discussed below. Making use of the lower bound for the coefficient w\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032 in Eq. (39), we deduce the lower bound for (t ):\n(t ) A(N ) 2N e\u2212N[\u03b2p(M )+2\u03b3 (t )]. (41)\nThe coefficient A(N ) does not depend on time t but depends on N for N 1 as\nA(N ) = a \u221a Ne\u2212cN , (42)\nwhere a and c are positive constants independent of N in the asymptotic limit of large N . Thus, we obtain the lower bound of the energy gap (t ) as follows:\n(t ) a \u221a N\n2N e\u2212N[\u03b2p(M )+2\u03b3 (t )+c]. (43)\nAs a result of this equation and Eq.

            "text": "Here, we deduce a condition that ensures convergence of SQA from the bound (45). It is natural to assume that (t ) is a monotonically decreasing function from a large value at t = 0 toward zero in the long-time limit. Thus, \u03b3 (t ) is monotonically increasing according to the definition of Eq. (9). Suppose that the first term in the first line on the left-hand side of Eq. (45) is fixed to a small constant c1. Solving the differential equation\n|\u03b3 \u2032(t )|e4N\u03b3 (t ) = c1, (46) we obtain the solution in terms of (t ) as follows:\n(t ) = M \u03b2\ntanh\u22121 (\n1 (4N )1/2N (c1t + c2)1/2N ) , (47)\nwhere c2 is an integral constant. With this form of (t ), we find that |\u03b3 \u2032\u2032(t )|e4N\u03b3 (t ) = c21(c1t + c2)\u22121, which tends to zero as t \u2192 \u221e; therefore, the solution (47) satisfies the asymptotic adiabatic condition for the imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation, given that c1 is chosen to be small enough, as required in Eq. (45).\nThis result inspires us to analyze a more general function of the following form for the coefficient of the transverse field (t ):\n(t ) = M \u03b2\ntanh\u22121 (\n1 (c1t + c2)g(t ) ) . (48)\nHere, g(t ) denotes a twice-differentiable, strictly positive function, g(t ) > 0, and c1 and c2 denote constants with c1 > 0, as we mentioned previously. For (t ) of the form (48) to ensure convergence, conditions are imposed on the functions g(t ), g\u2032(t ), and g\u2032\u2032(t ). We state this main result as the following proposition:\nProposition 1. Simulated quantum annealing for closed systems converges to thermal equilibrium of the final Ising\n062614-5\nHamiltonian in the long-time limit when the function g(t ) in (t ) of Eq. (48) satisfies the following conditions for sufficiently large t :\n0 < g(t ) 1 2N , (49)\n|g\u2032(t )| c \u2032\n(c1t + c2) ln(c1t + c2) , (50)\n|g\u2032\u2032(t )| c \u2032\u2032\n(c1t + c2) ln(c1t + c2) , (51)\nwhere c\u2032 and c\u2032\u2032 denote positive constants, provided that the constants c1, c\u2032, and c\u2032\u2032 are chosen to be small enough, satisfying(\n3b c1 4N\n+ 3b c \u2032\n2 + c\n\u2032\u2032\n2\n) M 22N e2N\u03b2p(M )+2Nc 1 (52)\nfor fixed, possibly large, values of M, N , and \u03b2. Proof. First, we show that conditions (49) and (50) are necessary for the QA convergence. When (t ) takes the form (48), \u03b3 (t ) is given as\n\u03b3 (t ) = g(t ) 2 ln (c1t + c2). (53)\nThen, \u03b3 \u2032(t )e4N\u03b3 (t ) has the following expression:\n\u03b3 \u2032(t )e4N\u03b3 (t ) = g(t ) 2 c1 (c1t + c2)2Ng(t )\u22121\n+ g \u2032(t ) 2\n(c1t + c2)2Ng(t ) ln (c1t + c2). (54) The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (54) needs to be bounded from above by a finite constant as t \u2192 \u221e, which requires 2Ng(t ) \u2212 1 0. This yields the first stated condition (49). For a similar reason, the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (54) needs to be bounded from above by a finite constant as t \u2192 \u221e, which yields the second condition (50). When those conditions of Eqs. (49) and (50) are satisfied, |\u03b3 \u2032(t )|e4N\u03b3 (t ) has the following bound:\n|\u03b3 \u2032(t )|e4N\u03b3 (t ) c1 4N\n+ c \u2032\n2 . (55)\nThus, we find that the term |\u03b3 \u2032(t )|e4N\u03b3 (t ) can be made arbitrarily small when c1 and c\u2032 are chosen to be sufficiently small under conditions (49) and (50).\nNext, we explain that condition (51) is also necessary to keep the term |\u03b3 \u2032\u2032(t )|e4N\u03b3 (t ) arbitrarily small as t \u2192 \u221e. With Eq. (53) for \u03b3 (t ), we obtain the following expression for \u03b3 \u2032\u2032(t )e4N\u03b3 (t ):\n\u03b3 \u2032\u2032(t )e4N\u03b3 (t ) = c1g\u2032(t ) (c1t + c2)2Ng(t )\u22121\n\u2212 c21 g(t ) 2 (c1t + c2)2Ng(t )\u22122 +g \u2032\u2032(t ) 2\n(c1t + c2)2Ng(t ) ln (c1t + c2). (56) For the third term on the right-hand side of Eq. (56) to be bounded from above by a finite constant, we need condition (51).\nWe can confirm that the term |\u03b3 \u2032\u2032(t )|e4N\u03b3 (t ) can be made arbitrarily small as t \u2192 \u221e under conditions (49), (50), and\n(51) when c\u2032\u2032 is chosen to be sufficiently small. In fact, we have the following bound under the stated conditions:\n|\u03b3 \u2032\u2032(t )|e4N\u03b3 (t ) c1|g\u2032(t )| (c1t + c2)2Ng(t )\u22121\n+c21 g(t ) 2 (c1t + c2)2Ng(t )\u22122 +|g \u2032\u2032(t )| 2 (c1t + c2)2Ng(t ) ln (c1t + c2)\nc1c \u2032 (c1t + c2) ln(c1t + c2) + c21 4N (c1t + c2)\u22121 + c \u2032\u2032 2 .\n(57)\nIn the last line of this equation, the first two terms tend to zero as t \u2192 \u221e; the last term becomes arbitrarily small when c\u2032\u2032 is chosen to be small enough by following Eq. (52). This concludes the proof of the proposition.\nRemark 1. Notice that g(t ) should increase as t \u2192 \u221e if we demand (t ) decreases faster than a polynomial of t . Therefore, we learn that the coefficient (t ) of the form (48) cannot decrease faster than a polynomial of t . This result can be compared with a similar result deduced in Ref. [38] for the real-time Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics.\nRemark 2. The expression in Eq. (47) for (t ) turns out to be the best possible according to Eq. (49).\nRemark 3. By choosing sufficiently large \u03b2 and M, the system will become sufficiently close to the ground state of the classical Ising model in Eq. (6) in the long-time limit."

The result is in qualitative agreement with the rigorous version of the convergence condition for closed systems derived from the theory of inhomogeneous Markov processes [5,25], where the condition of convergence has been proved to be\n(t ) M \u03b2 tanh\u22121 1 (t + 2)2/RL1 . (71)\nHere, R is a constant of order N , and L1 is an N-independent constant. Notice that the unit of time is different in those approaches: discrete steps for the above result in Refs. [5,25] and continuous time evolution in the present paper, resulting in the difference of coefficients of t , unity in Eq. (71) and c1 in Eq. (48). It is still encouraging that essentially the same conclusion has been reached by two completely different methods, partly because the present physics-oriented approach may be more flexible in applications to other problems than using the mathematically solid, yet hard to generalize, theory of inhomogeneous Markov processes.\nIt is worth noting that there is no essential difference in the convergence conditions for closed and open systems. The origin of this fact is that the additional term for environmental effects in Eq. (60) is time independent. We thus conclude that phase-flip errors caused by the environment as represented by Eq. (58) do not essentially modify the generic bound on the rate of change of the time-dependent coefficient.\nAnother interesting fact is that the time dependence of the coefficient (t ) in Eq. (47) is quite similar to the corresponding convergence condition for real-time QA for closed systems as derived earlier under rigorous [38] and asymptotic [5,36,37] adiabatic conditions. For example, the asymptotic version of the convergence condition under the real-time Schrdinger dynamics is\n(t ) = a(\u03b4t + c)\u22121/(2N\u22121), (72)\n062614-7\nwhere a, \u03b4, and c are time-independent constants. In the case of the imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics, when time t is large, Eq. (47) becomes\n(t ) \u223c M \u03b2(4N )1/2N (c1t + c2)\u22121/2N . (73)\nThe forms of the two equations, (72) and (73), are quite analogous. It is difficult to explain intuitively why those two completely different dynamical processes follow almost identical convergence conditions. This is particularly so, given that the real-time Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics operates at zero temperature, whereas the present results, Proposition 1 and Corollary 1, apply at any temperature, high or low, although one usually chooses very low temperatures to study the ground-state behavior of the system using SQA. We cannot exclude the possibility of an accidental coincidence, but also some deep physics may lie behind this fact. We leave it to future work to try to answer this intriguing question."
