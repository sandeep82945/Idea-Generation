 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a study comparing text-based interventions to video-based interventions in eSano. The paper suggested videos may be more engaging than text blocks for users. A comparative study could provide insights into which format leads to higher engagement and adherence. 

2. Test the effects of different text and background color combinations on reading patterns and engagement. The red text was largely ignored in this study, but further research on optimal color schemes for highlighting important information could inform better interface design.

3. Evaluate the impact of customization options and personalization features on adherence rates. Allowing users to tailor settings to their needs may improve the user experience and promote continued usage.

4. Implement and test gamification elements in eSano interventions. The paper proposed gamification could increase engagement, but this should be evaluated through user studies.

5. Conduct longitudinal studies on the eSano platform to better understand changes in usage and engagement over time. The current study captured a single user session, but longer-term studies could provide insights into factors influencing adherence.
