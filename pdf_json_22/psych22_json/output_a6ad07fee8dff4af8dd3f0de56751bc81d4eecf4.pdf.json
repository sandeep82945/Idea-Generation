    "abstractText": "Background: Giving birth is often a positive experience, but 7\u201344% have negative experiences and about 4% develop posttraumatic stress disorder following childbirth (PTSD FC). This randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated the effect of internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) for women with negative birth experiences and/or at risk for PTSD FC. Methods: This was a superiority nonblinded multicentre RCT comparing iCBT combined with treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU only. Data were collected through questionnaires at baseline, at 6 weeks, 14 weeks and 1 year after randomization. The RCT was conducted at four delivery clinics in Sweden and participants were recruited from September 2013 until March 2018. Women who rated their childbirth experience as negative on a Likert scale, and/or had an immediate caesarean section or a haemorrhage of > 2000 ml were eligible. Primary outcomes were symptoms of posttraumatic stress (Traumatic Event Scale, TES) and symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS). Secondary outcomes were satisfaction with life (Satisfaction With Life Scale, SWLS) and coping (Ways of Coping Questionnaire, WCQ). Results: Out of 1810 eligible women, 266 women were randomised to iCBT+TAU (n = 132) or to TAU (n = 134). In the iCBT+TAU group 59 (45%) completed the treatment. ICBT+TAU did not reduce PTSD FC at 6 weeks, at 14 weeks, or at 1 year follow-up compared with TAU, according to the TES. Both the ITT and completer analyses showed significant time and quadratic time effects due to reduction of symptoms in both groups on the TES (re-experience subscale) and on the EPDS, and significant time effect on the self-controlling subscale of the WCQ (which increased over time). There was also a significant main effect of group on the SWLS where the TAU group showed higher initial satisfaction with life. Exploratory subgroup analyses (negative birth experience, immediate caesarean section, or severe haemorrhage) showed significant time effects among participants with negative birth experience on re-experience, arousal symptoms and depressive symptoms. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Data were collected through questionnaires at baseline, at 6 weeks, 14 weeks and 1 year after randomization. The RCT was conducted at four delivery clinics in Sweden and participants were recruited from September 2013 until March 2018. Women who rated their childbirth experience as negative on a Likert scale, and/or had an immediate caesarean section or a haemorrhage of > 2000 ml were eligible. Primary outcomes were symptoms of posttraumatic stress (Traumatic Event Scale, TES) and symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS). Secondary outcomes were satisfaction with life (Satisfaction With Life Scale, SWLS) and coping (Ways of Coping Questionnaire, WCQ).\nResults: Out of 1810 eligible women, 266 women were randomised to iCBT+TAU (n = 132) or to TAU (n = 134). In the iCBT+TAU group 59 (45%) completed the treatment. ICBT+TAU did not reduce PTSD FC at 6 weeks, at 14 weeks, or at 1 year follow-up compared with TAU, according to the TES. Both the ITT and completer analyses showed significant time and quadratic time effects due to reduction of symptoms in both groups on the TES (re-experience subscale) and on the EPDS, and significant time effect on the self-controlling subscale of the WCQ (which increased over time). There was also a significant main effect of group on the SWLS where the TAU group showed higher initial satisfaction with life. Exploratory subgroup analyses (negative birth experience, immediate caesarean section, or severe haemorrhage) showed significant time effects among participants with negative birth experience on re-experience, arousal symptoms and depressive symptoms.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Childbirth is a major life event and can be associated with both positive and negative psychological responses [1, 2]. In the existing literature, there is no consistent definition of a negative birth experience and no suggested systematic method to assess birth-related psychological trauma. A negative birth experience is often the result of an obstetric complication, but uncomplicated normal births can also lead to a negative experience [3]. The birth experience is the woman\u2019s subjective assessment; it is multidimensional and can be influenced by several factors such as mode of delivery, fear for self and / or the infant, loss of control, cultural and environmental factors [3, 4].\nIn Sweden, approximately 115,000 women give birth every year [5]. In a systematic review, the prevalence of negative birth experience ranges between 7 and 44% [6] while in a Swedish study, a prevalence of 9.6% is suggested [7]. Emergency caesarean section, extreme pain, obstetric anal sphincter injury and oxytocin augmentation have been associated with negative birth experience, together with lack of support from partner or staff [8]. Distress from a negative birth experience increases the risk for mood disorders in the postpartum period [9] and can lead to the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Following Childbirth (PTSD FC) [10\u201315]. According to DSM-IV [16], symptoms of PTSD are grouped into three clusters; 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event, 2) persistent avoidance of reminders of the event and, 3) increased arousal e.g. hypervigilance or difficulty concentrating. The symptoms must have been present for at least a month and cause significant distress and impairment in occupational and social functioning. The mean prevalence of PTSD FC is 3\u20134% for women in community samples and 15.7\u201318.5% in high-risk samples (e.g. women who had emergency caesarean sections, severe fear of birth, a history of sexual/physical violence, babies born with very low birth weight or preterm babies) [15, 17]. PTSD FC can have lifelong impact and women with PTSD FC often report negative changes in their psychological wellbeing and have more psychiatric health problems, especially depressive symptoms, compared to women\nwithout a traumatic experience [18, 19]. The psychological state of the mother can also negatively affect her social interactions, such as the partner- relationship and bonding to the child [3, 18, 20\u201323].\nCognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is the treatment of choice for most anxiety disorders [24, 25]. It is also known that trauma-focused CBT (TF CBT) can be applied for perinatal women [26]. In Sweden there are no specific treatment recommendations for PTSD FC, but in some other western countries the methods of treatment for general PTSD are also recommended for treatment of PTSD FC [26, 27]. Few studies have investigated psychological interventions for women with PTSD FC. In a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of trauma-focused psychological therapies for PTSD FC [28], including ten RCTs, it was suggested that traumafocused interventions are effective for reducing symptoms of PTSD FC up to 6 months postpartum but there was no evidence that trauma-focused interventions can improve women\u2019s recovery from clinically significant PTSD FC.\nOnly one RCT has evaluated the effect of internetbased CBT (iCBT) for PTSD FC and found that iCBT had positive effect on both depressive symptoms and anxiety [29]. ICBT has many advantages over face-to-face CBT. It gives the patients flexibility to work with the material at any time they prefer and it reaches the patient independently of geographical location [30]. ICBT also has the advantage of greater flexibility and higher anonymity for the patient. In summary, both negative birth experience and PTSD FC can affect the wellbeing of mother and child to a large extent, and at the same time, few RCTs have investigated the efficacy of iCBT for this population.\nThe primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based self-help program based on CBT compared to treatment as usual (TAU) for women with negative birth experience and/or PTSD FC in a randomized controlled trial. We hypothesized that adding iCBT to TAU will be more effective than TAU alone in reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms. We also presumed that iCBT would increase participants\u2019 quality of life and positively affect their coping abilities.\nConclusions: The ICBT intervention did not show superiority as both groups showed similar beneficial trajectories on several outcomes up to 1 year follow-up. This intervention for women with negative birth experiences and/or at risk for PTSD FC was feasible; however, the study suffered from significant drop out rate. Future studies with more narrow inclusion criteria and possibly a modified intervention are warranted.\nTrial registration: ISRCTN39318241. Date for registration 12/01/2017.

The study had two primary outcome measures (symptoms of posttraumatic stress assessed with The Traumatic Event Scale, TES, and depressive symptoms assessed with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS), and two secondary outcome measures (quality of life assessed with The Satisfaction with Life Scale, SWLS and ability to cope assessed with The Ways of coping questionnaire, WCQ). TES measures post-traumatic stress symptoms related to childbirth; the scale is a self-assessed measure and was developed to follow the DSM-IV criteria [16] criteria for PTSD FC [14]. TES consists of 24 questions with four questions for criterion A (the stressor criterion), 17 questions for criterion B-D (re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal) and one question for criterion E (time since the trauma) and F (the impact of the trauma on everyday life). Questions for criteria A-D follows by alternatives that gives 0\u20133 points, were the symptom sum score (criteria B-D) can go from 0 to 51 points, were a higher\nFig. 1 Flowchart of participants and assessments in the study\nscore indicate more symptoms of PTSD. TES has been evaluated in a Swedish context and considered clinically relevant. When used as a screening instrument for PTSD the recommended cut-off symptom score is \u226530 [33]. A preliminary validation of TES showed Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 .92 for symptom sum score on a group of women meeting the criterion A, with a sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 84% [33].\nEPDS assesses symptoms of depression in the perinatal period. Respondents rate the intensity of symptoms during the previous 7 days [34]. It consists of 10 items, rated from 0 to 3, were higher scores indicates more depressive symptoms. When used in clinical settings, a cut-off point of \u226512 is often used [35]. EPDS has shown good validity when screening for post partum depression with good sensitivity (86%), specificity (78%), high standardised Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 (.87) and split-half reliability (.88) [35].\nSWLS assesses quality of life and well-being [36]. The five items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 5 to 35, where a higher score indicate higher satisfaction with life. SWLS has good internal consistency, convergent validity and also good test-retest correlation (\u03b1 = .87 and r = .82 respectively) [36, 37].\nFinally, the WCQ is a self-report questionnaire, designed to assess and identify thoughts and actions individuals use to cope with a stressful event [38]. In this study a version with five of eight subscales were used (confrontive coping, self-controlling, seeking social support, escape-avoidance, and planful problem solving). The questionnaire consists of 33 items rated on a 4-point\nLikert scale ranging from 0 to 3 where a higher score indicates higher use of the coping method. The internal inconsistency is acceptable (\u03b1 .61\u2013.79) according to the manual [38]."

For the continuous outcome data, a mixedmodel repeated measures analysis (MMRM) was used. The assumptions for repeated measurements were met (e.g. Mauchly\u2019s test of sphericity). Using a mixedmodel analysis enabled the inclusion of all data since the analysis makes predictions based on available data, regardless of data missing at different time points, thus making it suitable for intent to treat (ITT) analysis. A MMRM model includes both fixed and random effects. Models were compared using the maximum likelihood method. We included two between levels (iCBT+TAU and TAU) and four within assessments (0, 6, 14 weeks and 1 year after randomization). After visual inspection of repeated measures, quadratic time effects were investigated where change was assessed as non-linear. Statistical analyses were first performed in an ITT principle, where each participant was analysed according to randomization. We then analysed the data per-protocol, where those who received iCBT were only included in the analysis if they received a minimum of three sessions of iCBT. We also planned for calculation of effect sizes for significant interaction effects between the groups at the last assessment (i.e., at 1 year follow-up), based on the estimated means, using Cohen\u2019s d where 0.20 is considered a small effect, 0.50 a medium effect, and 0.80 a large effect [41]. Odds ratios regarding PTSD diagnosis were calculated between the groups. Exploratory sub-group analyses were performed in participants with solely negative birth experience, those who had an immediate caesarean section and those with a severe postpartum haemorrhage."

However, both groups (ICBT+TAU and TAU) in the ITT- and completer-analyses reported reduced symptoms on the subscale re-experiencing on TES over time (baseline to 14 weeks). The subscale includes symptoms of re-experiences of the trauma like flashbacks, dreams, intrusive memories, and the feeling of reliving the negative experiences. The majority of individuals who have been exposed to a traumatic event recover spontaneously by natural recovery or resilience\n[42]. Reduction of symptoms of re-experiences of the traumatic event could therefore be explained by a natural recovery for both the control and the intervention group. In line with these results, we found no significant benefit for the iCBT group regarding not meeting the criteria for PTSD at the three assessment points after end of treatment.\nResults similar to ours were seen in a randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the feasibility of iCBT for women with PTSD following childbirth [29]. After 8 weeks of iCBT significant reductions of PTSD symptoms were found in the treatment group as well as in the control group, and the treatment group showed the same reduction of PTSD symptoms as the control group. Although the RCT of Nieminen at al [29]. differed from ours in several ways, all participants reported posttraumatic stress symptoms related to their delivery more than 3 months postpartum. Women were included when they had a score on the Traumatic Event Scale (TES) over 30 points. Participants were divided into a group that received immediate treatment and a group put on a waiting list (control group), which would receive treatment 5 months later.

The treatment consisted of eight online modules, each with a therapy track and a homework track.\nSo far, only a few RCT\u2019s have evaluated the efficacy of different psychological treatments for women with negative birth experiences and/or PTSD following childbirth [28, 43]. One RCT on CBT for this population has been conducted. The study had a small sample size and did not achieve the number of participants for a power of 80% [29]. Therefore, we know very little about suitable interventions and how this population engage and commit to iCBT and similar interventions. In a review that aimed to assess the available treatment options for PTSD following childbirth, six studies met the inclusion criteria [43]. The authors concluded that debriefing, CBT and EMDR are available as treatment for PTSD following childbirth and the authors also pointed out the need of more RCT\u2019s before drawing conclusion about the effectiveness of these treatments.\nThe inclusion criteria (the cut off for negative birth experience on the Likert scale, immediate caesarean section, and severe postpartum haemorrhage) could have been over-inclusive and may not always correlate to risk of developing PTSD FC. It is well known that the subjective experience of the birth as negative is a risk factor for PTSD FC, but only a few women in this study fulfilled\nthe criteria for PTSD according to TES at baseline. In a Swedish RCT, the effect of iCBT for women with PTSD following childbirth was evaluated [29]. Participants were recruited via nationwide invitation and were thereafter extensively evaluated and diagnosed with validated measurements before entering the study. This way of recruiting participants is more time consuming but also more likely to capture motivated participants with a proper diagnosis for the intervention compared to our study.\nThere was also a significant main effect over time on the EPDS scale where depressive symptoms decreased over time in both groups. This result can also be explained by a natural recovery in most women. The same pattern was seen in the study of Nieminen et\u00a0 al. [29] where participants in both control- and treatment group had positive effects on depressive symptoms.\nSWLS is a short item instrument designed to measure global cognitive judgements of satisfaction with one\u2019s life. In the ITT- analysis, the TAU-group initially reported a higher satisfaction of life compared to the iCBT+TAU group, but the differences diminished over time due to a decrease in the TAU-group and no changes in the iCBT+TAU group. The time after birth can be emotionally challenging for the mother. Mood swings due to the new situation probably affect the mother\u2019s estimation of her life satisfaction. We cannot explain why the TAU group initially reported a higher satisfaction of life comparing to the iCBT+TAU-group. In the RCT of Nieminen et\u00a0 al. [29] quality of life was improved in the treatment group with a small to moderate effect size, but was not changed in the control group.\nIn the ITT- and completer analyses of WCQ both groups showed significant main effects of time on the subscale Self-controlling due to reported increase in this coping strategy over time. The subscale Self-controlling includes efforts to regulate one\u2019s feelings and actions [38]. In the completer-analysis of WCQ it was also a significant quadratic time effect on the subscale Seeking social support, where both groups changed over time by first decreasing from baseline to 14 weeks but increased at 1 year follow up. The subscale seeking social support includes efforts to seek informational support, tangible support, and emotional support [38]. In several cultures it is normal and accepted for new parents to spend the first time alone with the baby, before inviting other people to their home. Therefore, the results of a decreased effect on Seeking social support followed by increase during the first weeks with the new-born seem normal in the western context.\nIn our exploratory sub-analyses, we found significant time and quadratic time effect on TES (the subscale reexperiencing) and significant time effect on TES (the subscale arousal) for the group with a negative birth\nTES Traumatic event scale, EPDS Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, SWLS The Satisfaction with Life Scale, WCQ The Ways of coping questionnaire. a Quadratic time was a significant predictor: F (df) = 10.86*** (1227.483). b Quadratic time was a significant predictor: F (df) = 7.76**, (1225.98). c Quadratic time was a significant predictor: F (df) = 3.92*, (1227.14). * p < .05, ** p < .01, ***p < .001"

The subgroups with immediate caesarean section and severe haemorrhage included few participants, which limits the interpretation of the results.\nThe majority of the eligible women declined participation in the trial. Further, dropout-rates were generally high, both before and after randomization. Reasons and predictors for non-participation and dropout can be analysed from different perspectives. In a meta-analysis from 2010, three broad categories of predictors for dropout in internet interventions were identified: sociodemographic factors and contextual variables, psychological problems, and treatment-related variables [44]. In our study, one explanation for non-participation could be that our inclusion criteria (low rating of birth experience, immediate caesarean section or severe postpartum haemorrhage) were over-inclusive and did not fully correlate with a negative birth experience.\nOnly a handful of the randomized women reached the inclusion criteria for iCBT part 2, which precluded meaningful analyses. However, dropout in internet interventions is also generally high, especially in self-help programmes with little or no support [45]. More narrow inclusion criteria might have captured a more motivated and afflicted population. Also, regular weekly feedback and support from the psychologist instead of support on demand could have increased the treatment-adherence. On the other hand, self-help is a more cost-effective alternative for the provider than guided iCBT. Another explanation for non-participation or dropout could be that some women were so affected by the childbirth that they totally avoided participation in the study. Others might have dropped out because of by lack of time, tiredness, or exhaustiveness due to a demanding post-partum period. More research is needed to better understand how and when to offer professional support to women with negative birth experiences. Overall, the healthcare system needs to find effective ways to identify women in need of support by screening, asking questions and encourage women to talk about their symptoms."

            "text": "This is the first iCBT were women with negative birth experiences and/or posttraumatic stress were clinically recruited. Clinical recruitment increases the probability for a representative sample and indicates how the intervention would work in a natural clinical context. There are several other strengths in this study, the randomised controlled design, the sample size, and the equivalence between the groups at baseline, all of\nwhich are important factors for the validity [46]. An important advantage is the internet-format, which has not only a number of general benefits, but also ensures a certain degree of anonymity, online interventions pose a useful alternative and might reduce the barriers of help-seeking. We believe that iCBT is extra suitable for postnatal women, the intervention offers flexibility, and the participant can work with the material from home and at any preferred time.\nThis study also has limitations. We did not screen for PTSD, depression or other psychiatric disorders and the wide inclusion criteria are giving room for sample heterogeneity. The generalizability of our findings to the population of women with negative birth experiences and/or at risk for PTSD FC in a clinical setting is limited owing to the Internet-based setting of the treatment and our recruitment strategy. Factors such as accessibility to the internet, language, education, or interest in technology can have restricted the range of women who participated in our trial. We delivered a standardized manualized approach for all women. Using this approach, we cannot say whether all women benefited equally from the different steps and/or if some parts were particularly helpful. In this study we had no information about the specific content of the TAU, therefore we cannot know if or how TAU had an impact on the participant\u2019s symptoms. We chose TAU as control condition, which does not allow us to control for an active treatment intervention. Future studies should therefore implement comparator conditions such as an attention placebo group or some other active treatment aimed at the symptoms presented in this population.\nAnother methodological limitation was the poor treatment adherence and participants being lost to follow up. Retention at follow-up dropped considerably and explanations could be that the participants\u2019 motivation dropped after a while. Some individuals may find it demanding to participate in a clinical trial, with all the interventions and follow-ups. It is also well known that internet interventions with regular guiding generally are more effective than non-guided interventions [47]. In our study, participants could contact a therapist on demand, but in the RCT of Nieminen et\u00a0al. [29] the intervention included individual feedback every week by a personal therapist, which could explain a higher adherence.\nThe psychological health of the mother and/or a busy time being a new mother, could also have affected the level of motivation and adherence. Many women with a negative birth experience have a natural psychological recovery, which also could explain dropout in this study."
