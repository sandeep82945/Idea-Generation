1. **Investigate the impact of different charging mechanisms on public acceptability.** The current study examined the acceptability of congestion and parking charging policies with a fixed charging rate. However, other charging mechanisms, such as time-based or distance-based charging, could also be considered. Future research could investigate how different charging mechanisms affect public acceptability and identify the most acceptable mechanism for different contexts.


2. **Explore the role of trust in public acceptability.** The current study did not examine the role of trust in public acceptability. However, trust is an important factor that can influence people's willingness to accept new policies. Future research could investigate the role of trust in public acceptability of transport charging policies and identify strategies to build trust among the public.


3. **Examine the long-term effects of transport charging policies on travel behavior and environmental outcomes.** The current study focused on the short-term effects of transport charging policies on public acceptability. However, it is also important to consider the long-term effects of these policies on travel behavior and environmental outcomes. Future research could investigate the long-term effects of transport charging policies on these outcomes and identify the factors that contribute to their success or failure.


4. **Investigate the equity and distributional impacts of transport charging policies.** The current study did not examine the equity and distributional impacts of transport charging policies. However, these policies can have significant impacts on different socioeconomic groups. Future research could investigate the equity and distributional impacts of transport charging policies and identify strategies to mitigate any negative impacts.


5. **Develop and test interventions to increase public acceptability of transport charging policies.** The current study identified several factors that influence public acceptability of transport charging policies. Future research could develop and test interventions to increase public acceptability of these policies. These interventions could include public education campaigns, financial incentives, or changes to the design of the policies themselves.
