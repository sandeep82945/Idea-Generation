    "abstractText": "An accurate treatment of the structures and dynamics that lead to enhanced chemical reactivity in enzymes requires explicit treatment of both electronic and nuclear quantum effects. The former can be captured in ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations while the latter can be included by performing ab initio path integral molecular dynamics (AI-PIMD) simulations. Both AIMD and AI-PIMD simulations have traditionally been computationally prohibitive for large enzymatic systems. Recent developments in streaming computer architectures and new algorithms to accelerate path integral simulations now make these simulations practical for biological systems, allowing elucidation of enzymatic reactions in unprecedented detail. In this chapter, we summarize these recent developments and discuss practical considerations for applying AIMD and AI-PIMD simulations to enzymes.",

            "text": "Tremendous effort has been devoted to using molecular simulation to unravel how enzymes catalyze chemical reactions with such remarkable efficiency and selectivity. A large amount of this work has utilized classical molecular mechanical (MM) methods combined with fixed charge and, more recently, polarizable empirical force fields [92]. These classical methods have been successful in predicting and elucidating important properties ranging from ligand binding free energies to pKa\u2019s of active-site residues[103, 84, 8]. However, empirical force fields are unable to describe the full electronic reorganization in enzyme active sites arising from bond making/breaking and charge transfer along short hydrogen bonds. In addition, most force fields do not include parametrization for transition metals or non-standard\nEmail addresses: lwang@proteomics.rutgers.edu (Lu Wang), cisborn@ucmerced.edu (Christine M.

For these systems, single-point electronic structure calculations and geometry optimizations (i.e. quenching to the local 0 K structure) have been highly useful in determining bonding topologies, identifying transition states and intermediates, as well as predicting reaction kinetics [37, 8, 101]. However, one must go beyond these snapshot-based methods to determine the full electron density redistribution as the enzyme\u2019s structure fluctuates, which can lead to bond cleavage and proton movement.\nAb initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations evolve the nuclei using forces generated from the instantaneous electronic structure obtained at each time step, which allows coupling between nuclear motion and electronic rearrangement. These simulations treat the electrons quantum mechanically and the nuclei classically. However, if light atoms are present, nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), such as tunneling and zero point energy (ZPE), can also play an important role. For example, kinetic isotope effects of over two orders of magnitude on the enzymes\u2019 catalytic rates have been experimentally observed upon substituting hydrogen (H) by deuterium (D) [109, 63] and have been attributed to tunneling. Also, the ZPE in a typical oxygen\u2013hydrogen (O\u2013H) bond is \u223c5 kcal/mol. As a result, including the ZPE can significantly alter the structure and dynamics of systems containing short hydrogen bonds, which are commonly observed in biomolecules where the protein fold can position groups much closer than typically seen in solution [25, 80]. To treat NQEs one can perform ab initio path integral molecular dynamics (AI-PIMD) simulations, which exactly include the effect of NQEs on static equilibrium properties of a given electronic surface [9, 78, 83]. The imaginary time path integral formalism on which PIMD simulations are founded also forms the basis for the approximate centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) [14, 57] and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) [28, 45] approaches to obtain quantum dynamics.\nPerforming AIMD simulations for enzyme active sites has traditionally been a formidable computational task because electronic structure calculations must be performed at each time step. Due to the need to perform many thousands of electronic structure calculations for each picosecond evolved, these simulations are typically performed using density functional theory (DFT) to generate the wave function, although cheaper semiempirical methods such as density functional tight binding have also been employed when longer time scales are required, albeit at a loss in accuracy [96, 38]. However, recent theoretical and algorithmic advances and novel computer processing architectures have greatly accelerated these simulations and allowed for trajectories of hundreds of picoseconds or even nanosecond time scales for systems on the order of 60\u2013300 atoms. In particular, electronic structure calculations have been accelerated by the development of linear scaling [40, 10, 86, 11, 104] DFT methods and the advent of codes that use the massively parallel stream processing capabilities of graphical processing units (GPUs) [115, 116]. The former methods take advantage of the locality of the density matrix as well as the fact that both the Coulomb/Hartree and DFT exchangecorrelation energies are functions of the local spin density, which allows for a linear growth in computational cost when the system size increases. An example of the latter, which will be the major focus of this article, is the TeraChem electronic structure program, which uses GPUs to accelerate the computation of the electronic wave function and has demonstrated speedups of over 100 fold compared to CPU-based codes [115, 116, 117, 55]. This speedup has enabled ab initio energy calculations on both the ground and excitepd states of systems\ncontaining thousands of atoms, including polypeptides and proteins [115, 116, 117, 55, 68]. AI-PIMD simulations have typically required about 2 orders of magnitude more computational cost than the corresponding AIMD simulations. A large amount of this additional cost arises from the need to make many replicas of the system, each of which requires a separate electronic structure calculation. Hence a standard PIMD implementation requires 30\u201350 electronic structure calculations to evolve a single time step for a typical hydrogen containing system at room temperature [119, 9, 75]. In addition, the PIMD Hamiltonian contains high-frequency motions that limit the time step that can be employed and do not efficiently sample the full phase space if used directly. However, recent developments have significantly alleviated these issues, reducing the computational overhead for including NQEs in simulations [75, 74, 22, 19] and making it more efficient to extract isotope effects on free energy changes from these simulations [118, 21, 76].\nHere, we briefly review some considerations when performing electronic structure calculations of large biological systems with a particular emphasis on the GPU-accelerated TeraChem code. We then outline how these electronic structure developments have recently been combined with the latest PIMD algorithms to allow AI-PIMD simulations, which include nuclear and electronic quantum effects, to be performed for enzyme active sites."

The ability to now perform such large calculations have provided a number of insights into biological processes. For example, large-scale geometry optimizations showed that changes in protein structure upon mutation are directly correlated with enzymatic methyl transfer efficiency [129]. In addition, AIMD simulations have been used to examine charge transfer and polarization in the BPTI protein [114], discover new pathways for glycine synthesis from primitive compounds [122], and determine amorphous indium phosphide nanostructures [131].\nHowever, calculations of large systems have also highlighted deficiencies in DFT. In particular, semilocal DFT methods lead to large size-dependent errors and nonlocal exact exchange is necessary to fix these errors. As nonlocal exact exchange is extremely difficult to include in linear-scaling DFT methods, parallel stream processing computer hardware such as GPUs and software advances like those implemented in TeraChem are essential for large-scale exact exchange DFT calculations. While TeraChem is not linear scaling with the number of basis functions, N , over a large range of practical system sizes it achieves scaling of around N1.5, which is considerably better than the formal DFT scaling of N3 [72]. In this section we discuss the choice of basis set, DFT exchange correlation functional, and QM region in the hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations for biological systems."

            "text": "The basis set describes the electronic wave functions and must balance the accuracy of a given property with computational cost in the quantum chemistry calculation. For example, calculating gas-phase bond dissociation energies with a high level of theory to sub-kcal/mol convergence may require approaching the complete basis set limit [85, 49, 47]. However, for very large QM calculations, using such a large basis set is often not necessary, and including diffuse functions may lead to difficulties converging the wave function. In many condensed phase applications one is concerned with properties that are less sensitive to basis set effects, e.g. transfer of a proton between similar chemical groups. For such geometry based properties, smaller (e.g. double zeta) basis sets can often be sufficient to obtain the desired accuracy [123]. Figure 1 shows the potential energy profile for moving a proton along the active-site hydrogen bond network in an enzyme KSID40N . Except for 6-31G, all the other basis sets produce potential energy curves in quantitative agreement with that predicted using the largest basis set aug-cc-pVDZ.\nFigure 2 shows results from Kulik et al., who performed DFT structural optimizations of 58 proteins using TeraChem and showed that small basis sets such as MINI and STO3G, while computationally efficient, lead to significant errors in predicted properties such as bond lengths and structural clashes as compared to the experimental crystal structures [68]. This problem can be alleviated by using a double-zeta basis set such as 3-21G, although this basis set is still relatively small and thus is likely subject to basis set superposition errors and may be too inflexible for modeling more subtle changes in polarization. For an accurate description of the electronic wave function and hydrogen bonding, the basis set should include polarization functions on all atoms. For systems with electrons far from the nucleus such as anions or excitepd states, diffuse functions should also be included."

            "heading": "2.2. Density functionals and the role of exact exchange",
            "text": "While DFT is formally exact in principle, owing to the Hohenberg-Kohn and KohnSham theorems [51, 65], the functional form of the exchange-correlation energy is unknown and therefore it is necessary to make approximations for practical calculations [88, 12]. DFT methods in practice often approximate the electron exchange and correlation interactions by considering only semi-local properties of the electron density. For example, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals use the local spin density and its gradient at a given point in space [89], while meta-GGA functionals further include the kinetic energy of the density [110]. These semilocal functionals are often quite successful in regions of slowly varying electron density and can also benefit from cancellation of errors in the exchange and correlation functionals.\nDispersion is important for accurately modeling thermodynamic and substrate binding properties of enzymes. However, as dispersion is a long-range dynamical correlation effect, it is not accounted for in semilocal density functionals [59, 42]. A common technique to overcome this deficiency is to add an explicit, empirically parametrized attractive term to the DFT energy to represent interactions between atomic pairs, in which case \u2018-D\u2019 is usually appended to the name of the functional [127, 31, 41, 126]. These DFT-D approaches require little additional computational cost and often work quite well. Nevertheless, the accuracy\nof the DFT-D predictions depend on the size of the basis sets and are limited by the atom types included in the parametrization. An alternative, non-empirical approach is to compute the dispersion interaction between atoms based on the exchange-hole dipole model (XDM) [6, 58, 7]. This model also adds negligible computational cost to a DFT calculation, but its implementation in geometry optimizations and dynamical simulations is currently not practical because forces obtained from the XDM method have not been widely available.\nThe approximate exchange term in semilocal DFT methods produces errors in both the electron density and energy, which leads to the derivative discontinuity [87, 113, 66, 98], the many-electron self-interaction error [130, 81] and the delocalization error [82, 48, 132, 62]. These semilocal density functionals underestimate the energy gap between the highestoccupied and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) [82, 27, 26, 106], which leads to severe problems as the size of the QM region increases. We have shown that for molecules in aqueous solution, semilocal DFT methods predict that the band gap approaches zero and eventually the ground state self-consistent field (SCF) calculation can no longer converge if more and more solvent molecules are included in the QM region [56]. Similar difficulties were found by Kulik et al. when performing semilocal DFT calculations on entire proteins [68]. Additionally, we have recently shown that approximate semilocal exchange functionals generate a size-dependent error in the ionization potential, with the size of the error increasing as the size of the system grows [125, 105].\nMany of these inaccuracies can be improved by incorporating nonlocal exact exchange into the density functional via the generalized Kohn-Sham scheme [99]. Exact exchange is often included in approximate semilocal exchange methods through either global hybrid or range-separated hybrid (RSH) techniques. For global hybrids, such as the B3LYP functional [5], a fixed fraction of exact exchange (typically 20\u201350%) is included for all interelectronic distances. RSH methods vary the amount of exact exchange based on the interelectronic distance r12 \u2261 |r12| = |r1 \u2212 r2|, with the error function usually used to make the variation smooth for splitting the short-and long-range parts of the Coulomb operator\n1\nr12 = 1\u2212 erf(\u03c9r12) r12 + erf(\u03c9r12) r12 . (1)\nFor a long-range corrected (LC) hybrid, full exact exchange is used at long range (the erf(\u03c9r12) term), while semilocal DFT exchange dominates at short-range (the 1\u2212erf(\u03c9r12) term) to provide good balance with semilocal DFT correlation. The ratio of local DFT exchange to nonlocal exact exchange is determined by a range separation parameter, \u03c9, given in atomic units of inverse bohrs, a\u221210 [39, 53, 111, 128, 112, 4, 23]. The default value of \u03c9 is often between 0.2 and 0.5 a\u221210 , with smaller values leading to local DFT exchange having a longer range. A system-dependent \u2018optimal\u2019 \u03c9 can also be determined by tuning \u03c9 to enforce Koopmans\u2019 theorem [97, 107, 3, 67, 2].\nLong-range corrected hybrid functionals have the correct asymptotic limit for the exchange interaction, which often yields improved ionization potentials, band gaps, and excitation energies compared to experiment [94, 69, 106, 67, 95, 2], as well as improved convergence of the SCF ground state for systems containing large QM regions [68, 56]. However, although all long-range corrected hybrid functionals have the correct asymptotic behavior of\nthe exchange interaction, care must be taken to ensure that the range-separation parameter \u03c9 is large enough to fix the deficiencies of using approximate semilocal exchange at short range. We have recently shown that the choice of \u03c9 is key in determining the correct physical polarization in response to electron ionization. For example, for the ionization of a solvated ethene molecule, if \u03c9 is too small (below \u223c0.4 a\u221210 ), the surrounding water molecules will unphysically contribute some of their own electron density to the ionization process, while for a larger \u03c9 they will correctly polarize in response to the electron being removed from the solute [105]. This can be seen in the density differences for the neutral and cation systems shown in Figure 3. Thus the correct choice of functional, and particularly the treatment of exchange in the functional, is crucial for correctly describing processes that are key in enzymatic reactions such as polarization and charge-transfer. Hence, in addition to including dispersion through methods mentioned above, we recommend a long-range corrected hybrid functional such as LC-BLYP, LC-\u03c9PBE, or \u03c9B97, with an \u03c9 value in the range \u03c9=0.4-0.6 a\u221210 ."

            "text": "When simulating large biomolecules, it is desirable to accurately describe the region of interest, such as an enzyme\u2019s active site, using a high-level QM method with a large basis set. Such quantum mechanical treatments are only feasible for a fraction of atoms in biomolecules due to the high computational cost of the QM approach. However, unlike an isolated system in vacuum, the electrostatic environment in the condensed phase strongly polarizes the QM system and therefore it is crucial to include the environmental effects for a correct description of the energy, geometry, and electron density distribution in the QM region. The hybrid QM/MM approach takes advantage of both the accuracy of the QM method and the speed of the MM method, allowing the MM charges to polarize the QM wave function [124, 36]. The coupling between the QM and MM regions has been extensively investigated, see Refs. [70, 1] for examples; and for recent reviews of the QM/MM method see Refs. [96, 71, 100, 93]\nTo combine large-scale GPU-accelerated quantum chemistry calculations with MM force fields, we have created an extensive TeraChem interface for QM/MM calculations [54]. In this approach, TeraChem receives the point charges of the MM atoms and performs a QM calculation with the electrostatic embedding method to account for the polarization of the QM region due to the electrostatic MM environment. TeraChem then outputs the QM forces on each atom for the propagation of the QM/MM system. Communication between the QM and MM regions is either through files or the message passing interface (MPI). Although the TeraChem QM/MM interface was originally implemented with the AMBER molecular dynamics program [15], it is general enough to be used with any program that can accept quantum mechanical forces for molecular dynamics simulations. Indeed, the AIPIMD discussed in the following section were performed using the TeraChem MPI interface to connect to an in-house PIMD code to perform the dynamics.\nIdeally, the QM region in the QM/MM calculation will be large enough that the results are independent of QM region size. To test how large the QM region should be to compute converged properties, we performed excitepd state QM/MM calculations on photoactive\nyellow protein (PYP) and computed its absorption spectrum using six different QM regions of increasing size, which range from the photoactive chromophore alone (22 QM atoms, 217 basis functions) to including the entire protein and counter ions (1935 QM atoms, 16827 basis functions) [54]. For all calculations the total system was the same, which included the entire protein, counter ions, and a 32 A\u030a solvation sphere, and any atoms not included in the QM region were modeled with MM point charges. We found that although the electronic excitation was for the most part localized on the chromophore in all QM/MM calculations, a large QM region (723 QM atoms) was required to reproduce the energy of the largest QM system (the entire protein included in the calculation). Furthermore, the predicted excitation energy did not have a monotonic trend as the size of the QM region increased, but instead jumped around substantially (up by 0.4 eV when going from the 4th to 5th largest QM region) as additional protein residues were included in the QM region, see Figure 4. Overall, when sampling over many snapshots, this dependence of excitation energy on the size of the QM region led to significant differences in the final computed absorption spectrum [54].\nThe slow convergence of a local property, such as an excitation energy, with the size of the QM region suggests that the electrostatic interactions at the QM/MM boundary can cause large changes in the QM electron density. Therefore the QM region should be as large as possible to push this boundary away from the active site to obtain an accurate QM density. Others have arrived at similar conclusions about the large size required for the QM region, citing problems with charges at the QM/MM junction[108, 73, 52, 35, 34]."

It has been shown that the distance between the donor and acceptor heavy atoms, R, plays a crucial role in determining the proton behavior in a hydrogen bond [90, 79]. In particular, when R is around or below 2.7 A\u030a, the influence of NQEs becomes significant. For example, in liquid water, which has an average O\u2013O distance of around 2.8 A\u030a, the quantum nature of the hydrogen bonds leads to transient proton excursion events in which a proton is closer to the hydrogen bond acceptor than donor oxygen [18, 120].\nDespite the importance of NQEs, most molecular simulations are performed treating the nuclei as classical particles. The path integral formalism of quantum mechanics provides an efficient way to incorporate nuclear quantum effects in molecular simulations [33]. By combining the path integral methods and on-the-fly electronic structure calculations, one can perform AI-PIMD simulations to examine the nuclear and electronic quantum fluctuations in chemical and biological systems.

            "text": "Eq. 3 is exact when P \u2192 \u221e. In practice, a finite number of replicas P is used to converge the properties to the desired accuracy. A useful indication as to the number of replicas is P > \u03b2~\u03c9max where \u03c9max is the highest frequency present in the system. This criteria can be understood as stating that the role of P is to increase the effective thermal energy of each replica (PkBT ) to be larger than the energy level spacings in the system (~\u03c9max for a harmonic oscillator), i.e. allowing each replica to approach the classical limit [119, 75]. For example, the number of replicas used for convergence is typically P \u2265 32 for a hydrogen-containing system at 300 K. Since each replica of the system requires an ab initio\ncalculation to evaluate its energy and forces, the computational cost of PIMD simulations is therefore at least P times higher than the corresponding classical simulation.\nComputational overhead due to the convergence requirement can be significantly reduced using a generalized Langevin equation (GLE) thermostat [17, 20, 19]. By coupling the path integral system to a GLE thermostat (the PI+GLE approach), one can tune the correlated noise such that convergence of the potential energy, \u3008V \u3009, to its quantum mechanical expectation value can be achieved with considerably fewer path integral beads [17, 20]. However, the PI+GLE approach does not guarantee fast convergence of the quantum kinetic energy, \u3008T \u3009, as the centroid virial estimator for the kinetic energy (Eq. 7) [50, 13] involves correlations between the beads and the ring-polymer centroid. To allow rapid convergence of the kinetic energy, Ceriotti and coworkers have recently introduced the PIGLET method, which enforces the necessary correlations to accelerate the convergence of the centroid virial kinetic energy estimator [19]. The PIGLET approach allows the convergence of thermodynamic properties and isotope effects that depend on the kinetic energy (see discussions in the next section) using P = 6 for hydrogen-containing systems at 300 K. This reduces the computational cost by over 5 fold compared to a typical PIMD simulation [19, 18]. Parameters for the GLE thermostat can be conveniently generated using the GLE4MD input generator [16]."

            "text": "Isotope substitution techniques have been widely used in fields ranging from molecular biology to atmospheric chemistry [64]. Computer simulations that accurately and efficiently predict isotope effects form an important complement to experiments and have enabled detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism and thermodynamic equilibrium in a wide variety of chemical and biological processes [64].\nSince isotopes of the same element have almost identical electronic structures, the change in structural and thermodynamic properties due to isotope substitution arise entirely from the quantum mechanical nature of the nuclei. The central quantity for calculating these thermodynamic isotope effects is the free energy change upon isotope substitution, which can be computed exactly using PIMD simulations for a given electronic surface. For example, the free energy change upon exchanging D for H in a given system k, \u2206Ak, is directly related to the quantum kinetic energies of the isotopes by the thermodynamic integration [21]\n\u2206Ak = \u222b mD mH d\u00b5 \u3008Tk(\u00b5)\u3009 \u00b5 . (6)\nHere mH and mD are the masses of H and D, respectively. Tk(\u00b5) is the quantum kinetic energy of a hydrogen isotope of mass \u00b5 and can be determined from AI-PIMD simulations using the centroid virial estimator [50, 13],\n\u3008Tk(\u00b5)\u3009 = 3\n2\u03b2 +\n1\n2P P\u2211 j=1 \u3008(r(j) \u2212 r\u0304) \u00b7 \u2202V \u2202r(j) \u3009, (7)\nwhere V is the potential energy of the system and r\u0304 = \u2211P\nj=1 r (j)/P is the centroid position.\nFrom Eq. 6, one can in principle perform multiple PIMD simulations with varying \u00b5 and obtain \u2206Ak by carrying out the integration. This process can be greatly accelerated by using the free energy perturbation (FEP) method [21], which allows one to extract \u3008Tk(\u00b5)\u3009 from a single simulation of the most abundant isotope of hydrogen. From the FEP approach [21],\n\u3008Tk(\u00b5)\u3009 = \u3008Tk(mH)e\u2212h(\u00b5/mH ;r)\u3009mH \u3008e\u2212h(\u00b5/mH ;r)\u3009mH\n(8)\nwith\nh(\u03b1; r) = (\u03b1\u2212 1)\u03b2mH\u03c92P\n2P\nP\u2211 j=1 (r(j) \u2212 r(j+1))2. (9)\nIn the following, we use pKa as an example and demonstrate how one can efficiently extract thermodynamic isotope effects from PIMD simulations. Let us consider the sidechain pKa of an amino acid X in an enzyme upon H/D substitution. In H2O, this pKa corresponds to the chemical equilibrium where the neutral amino acid, XHEnzH , dissociates into the anion X\u2212EnzH and the proton H\n+ (shown in the scheme below). In D2O, we denote the neutral and ionized species of X as XDEnzD and X \u2212 EnzD, respectively. Note that in D2O all labile protons in the enzyme are exchanged to D, and thus X\u2212EnzH and X \u2212 EnzD are not necessarily identical. These chemical reactions can be connected using the thermodynamic cycle:\nAssuming the free energy changes of the aforementioned dissociation processes are \u2206A1 and \u2206A2, then the pKa isotope effect is\n\u2206pKEnza \u2261 pKEnzDa \u2212 pKEnzHa = \u2206A2 \u2212\u2206A1 2.303kBT = \u2206AEnz \u2212\u2206AEnz\u2212 \u2212\u2206AH 2.303kBT . (10)\n\u2206AEnz and \u2206AEnz\u2212 are the free energy changes upon converting XDEnzD and X \u2212 EnzD to XHEnzH and X \u2212 EnzH , respectively, and can be efficiently calculated from PIMD simulations using Eq. 6 along with the FEP method (Eq. 8). To obtain the absolute value of \u2206pKEnza one also needs \u2206AH , which is the free energy change upon converting D to H in aqueous solution. It can be computed from PIMD simulations of protons in liquid water using the same level of QM description as that for the enzyme. However, it is often computationally costly to properly sample the solvent configurations around the proton in order to determine an accurate \u2206AH . Alternatively, a useful metric is to compare \u2206pKEnza to a reference state such as the pKa isotope effect of the amino acid X in aqueous solution, \u2206pKSola . This results in an excess isotope effect,\n\u2206\u2206pKa \u2261 \u2206pKEnza \u2212\u2206pKSola , which represent the extra amount of NQEs arising from the unique enzyme environment as compared to aqueous solution.\nSimilar to the enzyme case, \u2206pKSola can be computed from the thermodynamic cycle\nXHSol and XDSol denote the neutral amino acid X in H2O and D2O, respectively, while X\u2212Sol represent the ionized species. Therefore,\n\u2206pKSola = pK SolD a \u2212 pKSolHa = \u2206A4 \u2212\u2206A3 2.303kBT = \u2206ASol \u2212\u2206AH 2.303kBT . (11)\nComparing \u2206pKEnza and \u2206pK Sol a makes the \u2206AH term cancel, and thus the excess isotope effect is\n\u2206\u2206pKa = \u2206pK Enz a \u2212\u2206pKSola = \u2206AEnz \u2212\u2206AEnz\u2212 \u2212\u2206ASol 2.303kBT . (12)\nIn this way, \u2206\u2206pKa can be extracted from PIMD simulations by computing the free energy changes upon isotope substitution in the enzyme and solution environment."

            "heading": "3.4. Electronic and nuclear quantum fluctuations in biological hydrogen bond networks",
            "text": "Combing the technical advances introduced earlier, we now demonstrate how one can employ AI-PIMD simulations to elucidate the interplay between electronic and nuclear quantum effects in enzymes. We have recently studied the behavior of an active-site hydrogen bond network in an enzyme mutant KSID40N by interfacing with TeraChem and taking advantage of the PIGLET algorithm [19] and the FEP method [21]. As the majority of computational cost comes from ab initio force evaluations on the P ring-polymer beads, we have parallelized these calculations across GPUs with one GPU dedicated for each bead. These methods allow us to achieve a simulation speed that is three orders of magnitude higher than existing AI-PIMD approaches. In addition, in TeraChem the speed of electronic structure evaluations scales almost linearly with the number of GPUs. Therefore, one can further speedup the simulations by assigning one node for each bead and using multiple GPUs on each node to carry out electronic structure calculations.\nIn KSID40N , the side chain groups of the active-site residues form a triad structural motif, in which residue Tyr57 sits at the center and forms two hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups of residues Tyr16 and Tyr32 (Figure 5(a)). In several high-resolution crystal structures [44, 102] the hydrogen bonded O57\u2013O16 and O57\u2013O32 distances are found to be around 2.6 A\u030a, noticeably shorter than those commonly observed in hydrogen bonded systems such as liquid water.\nIn order to choose the proper DFT functional and basis set for the QM region, we have calculated the potential energy profiles for proton transfer within the tyrosine triad. We\ndefine the proton transfer coordinate as \u03bd16 = dO16,H16\u2212dO57,H16, where dOi,Hj is the distance between the oxygen O of residue i and hydrogen H of residue j (Figure 5(a)), and a quantity \u2206E\u03bd=0 which represents the energy required to move the proton from its equilibrium position to the perfectly shared position, \u03bd16 = 0. As shown in Figure 6, all density functionals tested generate results that qualitatively agree with each other, although GGA functionals BLYP and PBE underestimate \u2206E\u03bd=0 by about 1.5 kcal/mol. Hybrid functionals B3LYP and PBE0 produce almost identical potential energy profiles, with the CAM-B3LYP RSH method in excellent agreement with the global hybrids. Dispersion corrections (D3 in this case) lead to very little change. Our basis set studies in Figure 1 demonstrate that 6-31G* is the smallest basis set that is able to produce the correct energy profile for proton transfer. Based on these tests, we choose to treat the QM region at the B3LYP-D3 level [5, 43] with the 6-31G* basis set.\nIn our AI-PIMD simulations, the QM region includes the tyrosine triad (47 atoms and 174 electrons) and is treated quantum mechanically in both the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. We have shown that increasing the size of the QM region by incorporating nearby residues does not significantly change the potential energy profile for proton transfer [121]. As environmental fluctuations are indispensable for a correct description of the QM region, especially the O\u2013O distances, we include the rest of the protein as well as solvent molecules and counter-ions in the MM region (over 52,000 atoms), which is described using the AMBER03 [30] force field and the TIP3P water model [60]. All bonds across the QM/MM boundary are capped with hydrogen link atoms in the QM region, which are constrained along the bisecting bonds and do not interact with the MM region. The total interactions in the QM/MM system include 1) forces between QM atoms, 2) forces between MM atoms and 3) electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between QM and MM atoms. Our simulation program obtains forces within the QM region and the electrostatic QM/MM interactions through an interface with TeraChem [117, 54], while the forces within the MM region and the Lennard-Jones QM/MM interactions are acquired via an MPI interface with the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package [91]. A snapshot of the QM/MM system is shown in Figure 5(a).\nThe impact of NQEs can be understood by comparing AIMD and AI-PIMD simulations of KSID40N . Figure 5(b) shows that NQEs significantly decrease the free energy required to move the proton from Tyr16 to Tyr57 (\u03bd16 \u2265 0), thus allowing the proton to be quantum mechanically delocalized in the active-site hydrogen bond network. This is manifested by the wide spread of the protons\u2019 ring polymer beads, which represents their position uncertainty (Figure 5(a)). This quantum delocalization leads to a 10,000 fold increase in the acidity dissociation constant of Tyr57 and a \u2206\u2206pKa of 0.50 compared to tyrosine in solution, in excellent agreement with experiment [121].\nDue to the short R in the active-site hydrogen bond network, the ZPE possessed by the O\u2013H bonds and \u2206E\u03bd=0 are both about 5 kcal/mol (Figure 6), which facilitates proton movements along \u03bd16. Hence the interplay between nuclear and electronic quantum effects qualitatively and quantitatively changes the proton behavior from classical hydrogen bonding to quantum delocalization."

In addition, recent developments will accelerate methods such as CMD [14, 57] and RPMD [28, 45] to obtain approximate quantum dynamics. These methods are not amenable to acceleration using the PIGLET approach. However, very recently it has been shown how the ring-polymer contraction (RPC) approach [75, 32], which exploits the separation of the forces acting on each copy of the system (Eq. 4) into rapidly and slowly varying parts, can be extended to AI-PIMD and RPMD simulations [77, 61].\nAs was illustrated in Sec. 3.4, AI-PIMD simulations can already provide novel insights into the structure and functional roles of short hydrogen bonds (R \u2264 2.6 A\u030a) in biological systems. Another area where AI-PIMD simulations may be able to offer important insights is the study of proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions, which play a fundamental role in photosynthesis, respiration, and enzymatic catalysis [24, 29, 46]. A comprehensive understanding of these biological processes requires simulation techniques that properly describe the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons and the light nuclei. With the recent advent of efficient AI-PIMD simulations, these techniques will provide powerful tools to aid in the unravelling of the function of complex biological systems."
