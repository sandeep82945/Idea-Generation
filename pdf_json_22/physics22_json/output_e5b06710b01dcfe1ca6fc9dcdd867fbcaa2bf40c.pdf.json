    "abstractText": "This contribution focuses on extracting the theoretical framework for the assessment and evaluation of the joint effect of rain, beam misalignment and hardware imperfections at long-range outdoor terahertz (THz) wireless systems. In this direction, we first report an appropriate system model for outdoor THz wireless systems that take into account the impact of different design parameters, including antenna gain and transceivers hardware imperfections, atmospheric conditions, such as rain, and parameters, like temperature, humidity and pressure, as well as stochastic beam misalignment that can be caused by thermal expansion, dynamic wind loads and/ot weak earthquakes. For this model, we extract novel closed-form expressions for the probability density and cumulative distribution functions of the THz wireless channel that captures the impact of geometric loss, beam misalignment and rain attenuation. We capitalized the aforementioned expressions by presenting closed-form formulas for the outage probability and achievable throughput of the system. Finally, we document an analytical policy that returns the optimal transmission spectral efficiency that maximizes the achievable throughput.

INTRODUCTION\nThe terahertz (THz) band has been identified as a catalyst of the next generation communication era, since it offers comparable to the fiber experience and, as a consequence, enables a number of data rate hungry application scenarios, including wireless backhauling of remote areas and costefficient midhauling connectivity [1]\u2013[7]. However, THz signals experience inherent high path-loss, due to their high\nVOLUME 4, 2016 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

To counterbalance the severe path loss, highdirectional antennas are employed at both the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX) [14], [15]. Unfortunately, directionality further complicates the establishment of the link, since perfect alignment between the transmission and reception beam is required [16], [17]. In practical implementations this requirement can be met very rarely. The main reasons are physical phenomena, such as thermal expansion, dynamic wind loads, and weak earthquakes, that can cause a jitter at TX and RX antennas placed in high buildings [18], [19].\nRecognizing this drawback, a great amount of research effort was put on analyzing, quantifying, and countermeasuring the impact of beam misalignment in THz wireless systems [4], [5], [20]\u2013[26]. In more detail, in [20], the authors performed ray-tracing simulations in an realistic indoor environment in order to characterize the impact of beam misalignment, while, in [21], the antenna gain degradation due to stochastic misalignment in an indoor THz wireless system was quantified, assuming that the azimuth and elevation misalignment follow independent and identical Gaussian distributions. In [22], the authors experimentally evaluated the impact of deterministic beam misalignment in highdirectional indoor THz wireless systems. In [23] and in [24], the impact of beam misalignment in indoor THz wireless systems operating at 100, 300, 400, and 500 GHz in terms of channel coefficient degradation were calculated by means of experimental measurements.\nFrom the theoretical point of view, in [4], the impact of stochastic beam misalignment on the outage, error, and ergodic capacity performance of outdoor wireless THz systems that experience small and/or large scale fading was presented. Similarly, a closed-form expression for the error probability of mixed THz-radio frequency (RF) wireless systems, in which the THz link suffer from beam misalignment, was extracted in [5]. In [25], the authors documented a closedform expression for the outage probability (OP) of wireless THz systems that experience fading, beam misalignment and phase noise. Finally, in [26], the authors presented novel closed-form expressions for the OP, error probabbility and ergodic capacity of THz wireless systems in the presence of stochastic beam misalignment and fog.\nAnother challenge, which outdoor THz wireless systems are facing, is received signal fluctuation under different weather conditions, i.e., weather-induced fading or, as it is called by both the THz the optical technology community scintillation [27], [28]. This phenomenon is generated as a consequence of the variation in the refraction index due to inhomogeneities in atmospheric temperature and pressure as well as water molecular density across the propagation path [29]. Weather-induced fading can dramatically affect the performance of THz wireless systems [30]. Motivated by this, several researchers have recently published a number of contributions concerning characterization, modeling, and analysis of the impact of different weather conditions on the performance of THz wireless systems [31]\u2013[41].\nSpecifically, in [31], the authors employed a weather emulating chamber in order to perform in-lab characterization of the impact of fog in both THz wireless systems and free space optics. Similarly, in [32], the propagation efficiency of broadband THz pulses through a dense fog by means of received signal strength was experimentally presented. In [33], closed-form expressions for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF), in terms of I-function, which characterize the joint impact of fog and beam misalignment, were presented. Building upon these expressions, the OP, average symbol error rate (SER), and ergodic channel capacity were derived.\nIn [34], the authors presented an experimental comparison of the impact of laboratory-controlled rain on the received signal strength and error rate performance of THz and infrared (IR) wireless systems. Their analysis concluded in the very interesting result that THz are slightly more robust to the impact of rain compared to the corresponding IR free space optics (FSO) systems. In [35], a rain attenuation characterization for THz wireless systems was conducted. Likewise, in [36], an analytical assessment on physical layer security of a point-to-point THz wireless link in rain and snow with a potential eavesdropper locating outside of the legitimate link path was performed. In the aforementioned paper, the authors employed the Gunn-Marshall and SekhonSrivastava to model the snowdrop size, and the MarshallPalmer as well as Weibull distributions to model the raindrop size.\nIn [37], an experimental comparison of the impact of turbulence in THz and IR wireless systems was documented. In [38], an analytical model that assess the overall impact of turbulence on THz systems was presented. Building upon this model, in [39], the authors extracted closed-form expression for the average error rate and channel capacity of THz wireless systems in the presence of turbulence, while, in [40], the authors statistically characterized the end-to-end channel of multi-RIS assisted THz wireless systems that experience turbulence. Finally, in [41], the joint impact of snow, turbulence, and beam misalignment on the bit error rate and channel capacity of THz wireless systems were quantified.\nWe also recall that another factor that needs to be taken into account in the modeling and assessment of THz wireless systems performance is the impact of transceivers hardware imperfections [42]\u2013[44]. In general, the effect of transceivers hardware imperfections was evaluated in several contributions, including [45]\u2013[54]. However, their detrimental effect on THz wireless systems were only recently examined [55]\u2013 [57]. In particular, in [55], the authors revealed the detrimental impact of transceivers hardware imperfections in the error performance of THz wireless fiber extenders. Moreover, in [56], the performance degradation due to transceiver hardware imperfections that operate at the 300 GHz band, were documented. Finally, in [57], the authors evaluated the impact of transceivers hardware imperfections in THz wireless systems that employ spatial modulation.\nDespite of the paramount importance that the weather\n2 VOLUME 4, 2016\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Towards filling this gap, in this paper, we investigate the joint impact of rain, beam misalignment and transceiver hardware imperfections in THz wireless systems. In more detail, the technical contribution of the paper can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We present a suitable system model for outdoor THz wireless systems, which accounts the different design parameters and their interactions as well as the presence and absence of rain. The aforementioned parameters include the transmission distance, the transceivers antenna gains, the level of beam misalignment, the transmission power, the atmospheric temperature, pressure and relative humidity, the expected value and variance of rain attenuation as well as the probability of rain.\n\u2022 In order to characterize the stochastic behavior of the THz wireless channel, we extract novel closed-form expressions for the PDF and CDF that captures the joint impact of geometric-loss, rain attenuation and beammisalignment.\n\u2022 Building upon the channel model, we present closedform expressions for the OP and the system throughput. The derived expressions accommodate the impact of stochastic beam misalignment, rain as well as transceiver hardware imperfections. As a benchmark, simplified expressions for the case in which the THz wireless system suffers only from beam misalignment and transceiver hardware imperfections are also presented. Another theoretical benchmark that is reported is the special case in which, although it rains, the THz wireless system does not experience beammisalignment. Note that this is an ideal non-realistic scenario, which allow us to quantify the severity of beam-misalignment.\n\u2022 Finally, we present an analytical policy for selecting the optimum transmission spectral efficiency that maximizes the achievable throughput, for given transmission power, levels of transceiver hardware imperfection and rain attenuation.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II is devoted to the presentation of the system and channel models. The statistical characterization of the THz wireless channel is reported in Section III. Section IV focuses on documenting the performance metrics, namely signal-to-distortionplus-noise-ratio (SDNR), OP, and throughput, as well as the throughput maximization policy. Numerical results and discussions are given in Section V. Finally, concluded remarks and observations are highlighted in Section VI. The organization of the paper in a glance is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nNotations: The absolute value and the square root of t are respectively denoted by |t| and \u221a t.

(19)\nNotice that in this work, we use a log-normal distribution to model the attenuation conditioned to the presence of rain. Moreover, note that \u00b5r and \u03c3r depend on the local climate and the link characteristics, such as transmission distance, operation frequency, as well as polarization of the electromagnetic wave. Ideally, \u00b5r and \u03c3r should be obtained as a result of a fitting problem to rain attenuation measurements. However, since experimental rain attenuation datasets are not usually available for THz frequencies, as described in [73] and in [74], we employ the following procedure in order to evaluate \u00b5r and \u03c3r.\nBy employing the Dirac-lognormal model and leveraging (19), the probability that rain attenuation exceeds a lowerthreshold, A, can be expressed as in [74]\nPA = Pr ( h2r \u2265 A ) = Po 2 erfc ( ln (A)\u2212 \u00b5r\u221a\n2\u03c3r\n) . (20)\nIn relatively-short distance (less than some decades of km) terrestrial THz wireless systems, it can be assumed that rainfall rate is homogeneous in the path. As a consequence, it can be estimated by evaluating the rain specific attenuation, \u03c1 that is measured in dB/km, for a corresponding rainfall rate,R, measured in mm/h, and multiply by the transmission distance, d, measured in km, i.e.\nA = \u03c1 d, (21)\nwhich based on the ITU-R Recommendation P.838-3 [75], can be rewritten as\nA = kr R ar d. (22)\nIn (22), \u03bar and ar are frequency- and polarization-dependent parameters provided in [75] for frequencies between 1 and 1000 GHz.\nThe procedure that we followed in this contribution in order to derive Po, \u00b5r, and \u03c3r for the desired frequency and site, starts by obtaining the complementary CDF (CCDF) of rainfall rate Po for the site using the model of ITU-R Rec. P.837-7 [76], which provides rainfall rate distributions for every location in the world for propagation modeling purposes. The probability of rain presence P0,r is also provided. Assuming the links are relatively short, i.e., less than 1 km, (22) is used to convert each R value associated to a probability into anA value associated to the same probability, and the probability of having rain attenuation present is made equal to the probability of rain presence, i.e. Po = P0,r. Then, the parameters \u00b5r and \u03c3r of the log-normal distribution are calculated by fitting the distribution PA obtained from Pr (x \u2264 R) to a distribution with the form of (20), using the procedure described in Annex 2 of ITU-R Rec.

RESULTS & DISCUSSION This section focuses on verifying the analytical framework that was documented in Section IV through Monte Carlo simulations.In this directions, unless otherwise stated, lines and markers are used for analytical results and simulations, respectively. The following scenario is considered. The transmission frequency and distance are set to 120 GHz and 100 m, respectively. The relative humidity, atmospheric\npressure, and temperature are 50%, 101325 Pa, and 296 oK. Finally, both the TX and RX antenna gains are 55 dBi.\nThe rest of the section is organized as: In Section V-A, the joint impact of rain and misalignment is quantified assuming that both the TX and the RX are equipped with ideal RF front-ends, i.e. \u03bat = \u03bar = 0. Section V-B documents the joint impact of transceivers hardware imperfections, rain, and beam misalignment on the outage and throughput performance of THz wireless systems.\nA. IDEAL RF FRONT-END Figure 3 quantifies the impact of beam misalignment on the outage performance of a THz wireless system that operates under rain. In more detail, the OP is plotted as a function of the transmission SNR, \u03b3s, for different values of \u03b3th and \u03c3m, assuming that \u00b5r = \u22122.04 and \u03c3r = 0.86. Note that the aforementioned values correspond on raining conditions in Athens, Greece, for transmission distance that equals 100 m. Moreover, we assume that Po = 1. This indicates that we assess the THz wireless system performance for an observation period that is raining. As a benchmark, in this figure, we also presented the outage performance in the absence of misalignment. We observe that, for fixed \u03c3m and \u03b3th, as \u03b3s increases, the OP decreases. For example, for \u03c3m = 0.05 and \u03b3th = 0 dB, as \u03b3s increases from 25 to 30 dB, an approximately two orders of magnitude OP improvement is observed. Moreover, for given \u03b3s and \u03c3m, as \u03b3th increases, i.e. as the spectral efficiency of the transmission scheme increases, the OP also increases. For instance, for \u03b3s = 25 dB and \u03c3m = 0.05,the OP increases for one order of magnitude, as the \u03b3th changes from 0 to 5 dB. From this figure, it also becomes apparent that, for fixed \u03b3s and \u03b3th, the outage performance degrades as the level of beam misalignment, i.e. \u03c3m, increases. For example, for \u03b3s = 25 dB and \u03b3th = 0 dB, the OP increases from 5.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 to 1.16 \u00d7 10\u22122, as \u03c3m increases from 0.05 to 0.1. Finally, the importance of accounting the impact of misalignment when assessing the performance of THz wireless systems is highlighted. For instance, for \u03b3s = 30 dB, \u03b3th = 0 dB and \u03c3m = 0.1, an outage performance evaluation error that is greater than two orders of magnitude occurs, if the impact of beam-misalignment is not taken into consideration. This indicates that neglecting the impact of beam misalignment\nVOLUME 4, 2016 7\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

As described in Section II-B3, the parameters \u00b5r, \u03c3r and Po are interdependent climate parameters that are affected by the observation period. However, in order to present the generality of the presented analysis and to derive some useful insights that connects the outage performance with the probability of rain, in this figure, we fix the parameters \u00b5r and \u03c3r, and quantify the OP for different values of Po. Furthermore, notice that Po = 0 refers to the case in which the THz wireless system suffers only from beam misalignment. As expected, for given Po and \u03b3s/\u03b3th, the OP increases, as \u03c3m increases. For example, for Po = 0.5 and \u03b3s/\u03b3th = 30 dB, the OP increases from 2.62 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1.17\u00d7 10\u22124, as \u03c3m increases from 0.05 to 0.1. Likewise, for fixedPo and \u03c3m, as \u03b3s/\u03b3th increases, the outage performance improves. For instance, for Po = 0.5 and \u03c3m = 0.05, the OP\ndecreases from 4.6\u00d710\u22121 to 5.6\u00d710\u22122 as \u03b3s/\u03b3th increases from 10 to 20 dB. Finally, we observe that, for given \u03c3m and \u03b3s/\u03b3th, the OP increases as Po increases. For example, for \u03b3s/\u03b3th = 30 dB and \u03c3m = 0.05, the OP increases from 5.24 \u00d7 10\u22128 to 5.24 \u00d7 10\u22125, as Po increases from 10\u22123 to 1. This reveals the severity of the joint impact of rain and beam misalignment.\nFigure 5 illustrates the throughput as a function of \u03b3s, for different values of \u03b3th and \u03c3m, assuming Po = 0, \u00b5r = \u22122.04, and \u03c3r = 0.86. As a benchmark, the throughput in the absence of beam misalignment is also plotted. As expected, for given \u03b3th and \u03c3m, as \u03b3s increases, the OP decreases; thus, the throughput increases. For instance, for \u03b3th = 0 dB and \u03c3m = 0.05, the throughput increases from 7.16 \u00d7 10\u22122 to 0.89, as \u03b3s increases from 10 to 20 dB. Moreover, for a fixed \u03c3m, the selection of the appropriate transmission scheme that maximizes the achievable throughput depends from the available transmission SNR. For example, for \u03c3m = 0, to achieve the maximum possible throughput, a transmission\n8 VOLUME 4, 2016\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Similarly, for \u03c3m = 0.05, a transmission scheme with \u03b3th = 0 dB should be selected, if \u03b3s < 20 dB, while if \u03b3s > 20 dB, a transmission scheme with \u03b3th = 5 dB should be chosen. This example reveals the importance the importance of taking into account the joint impact of beam misalignment and rain as well as the available transmission power, when selecting the appropriate transmission scheme. Finally, we observe that for given \u03b3s and \u03b3th, as \u03c3m increases, the throughput decreases. For example, for \u03b3s = 30 dB and \u03b3th = 10 dB, the throughput decreases from 3.07 to 2.9 bits/s/Hz, as \u03c3m increases from 0.05 to 0.1. This reveals the importance of accounting the impact of beam misalignment when assessing the throughput performance of THz wireless systems in the presence of rain.\nFigure 6 depicts the throughput as a function of Po for different values of \u03b3s and \u03b3th, assuming \u00b5r = \u22122.04, \u03c3r = 0.86, and \u03c3m = 0.05. From this figure, it becomes evident\nthat in the low \u03b3s/\u03b3th regime, where \u03b3s/\u03b3th \u2264 1Aoh2t , i.e., the transmission and reception beams are fully misaligned and thus Fh2|\u03b4=0 (\u03b3s/\u03b3th) = 1, the throughput increases, as Po increases. For instance, for \u03b3th = \u03b3s = 0, the throughput increases by about 10 times as Po changes from 0.2 to 1. On the other hand, for \u03b3s/\u03b3th > 1Aoh2t , as Po increases, the throughput decreases."

            "text": "Figure 7 illustrates the OP as a function of \u03bat and \u03bar for different values of \u03c3m, assuming that \u00b5r = \u22122.04, \u03c3r = 0.86, Po = 0, \u03b3s = 30 dB, and \u03b3th = 1 dB. Note that \u03bat = \u03bar = 0 corresponds to the ideal case in which both the TX and RX are equipped with ideal RF frontend. As expected, for fixed \u03c3m and \u03bat, as \u03bar increases, the OP increases. For example, for \u03c3m = 0 and \u03bat = 0.22, the OP increases from 2.59 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 6.96 \u00d7 10\u22126, as \u03bar increases from 0.2 to 0.4. Similarly, for given \u03c3m and \u03bar, as \u03bat increases, the OP also increases. Likewise, it becomes evident that system A with \u03bat = v1 and \u03bar = v2 achieve the same outage performance as system B with \u03bat = v2 and \u03bar = v1, under the same \u03c3m. Likewise, from this figure, it becomes apparent that for a fixed \u03c3m and a constant \u03bat +\u03bar, the worst outage performance is achieve for \u03bat = \u03bar. For instance, for \u03c3m = 0, and \u03bat + \u03bar = 0.2, we observe that the OP that is achieved for \u03bat = 0 and \u03bar = 0.2, which is equal to 2.19 \u00d7 10\u22126, is lower than the OP achieved for \u03bat = \u03bar = 0.1 (i.e. 2.31 \u00d7 10\u22126). In addition, we verify that systems with the same \u03ba2t + \u03ba 2 r achieve the same OP. Finally, for given \u03ba2t +\u03ba 2 r , the OP increases, as \u03c3m increases. For example, for \u03ba2t + \u03ba 2 r = 0.02, the OP increases from 2.31\u00d710\u22126 to 2.54\u00d710\u22124, as \u03c3m changes from 0 to 0.1. This highlights the importance of accurately modeling the level of beam misalignment.\nFigure 8 depicts the OP as a function of Po for different values of \u03bat, \u03bar, and \u03b3th, assuming \u00b5r = \u22122.04, \u03c3r = 0.86, and \u03c3m = 0.05. Interestingly, for fixed \u03bat, \u03bar, and \u03b3th, as Po increases, the OP also increases. Moreover, for given Po and \u03b3th, as the level of hardware imperfections increases, the OP also increases. For example, for Po = 0.5 and \u03b3th = 5 dB, the OP increases from 3.8\u00d7 10\u22123 to 7.7\u00d7 10\u22123, as \u03bat = \u03bar changes from 0.1 to 0.2. This reveals the importance of accurately modeling the level of hardware imperfections, when assessing the outage performance of wireless THz systems in the presence of misalignment and rain. Finally from this figure, it becomes evident that for a given Po, as \u03b3th increases, the impact of hardware imperfections on the system\u2019s outage performance becomes more detrimental.\nFigure 9 presents the throughput as a function of \u03bat and \u03bar for different values of \u03c3m, assuming that \u00b5r = \u22122.04, \u03c3r = 0.86, Po = 1, \u03b3s = 30 dB, and \u03b3th = 5 dB. For given \u03c3m and \u03bat, as \u03bar increases, the OP increases; as a result, the achievable throughput decreases. For example, for \u03c3m = 0 and \u03bat = 0.2, the achievable throughput decreases from 2.06 to 2.02 bits/s/Hz, as \u03bar changes from 0 to 0.4, while, for \u03c3m = 0.1, the same \u03bat and \u03bar change\nVOLUME 4, 2016 9\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nresults to an achievable throughput variation from 2.02 to 1.81 bits/s/Hz. This example indicates that as the level of beam misalignment increases, the impact of hardware imperfections on the throughput performance becomes more severe. Moreover, for fixed \u03c3m and \u03bat + \u03bar, the minimum achievable throughput is achieved for \u03bat = \u03bar. Likewise, for a given \u03c3m, the same throughput is achieve for every \u03bat and \u03bar combination for which \u03ba2t + \u03ba 2 r is constant. Finally, for a given \u03ba2t + \u03ba 2 r , the throughput decreases, as \u03c3m increases.\nFigure 10 presents the throughput as a function of \u03b3th for different values of \u03b3s and \u03bat = \u03bar, assuming that \u00b5r = \u22122.04, \u03c3r = 0.86 and Po = 1. From this figure, it becomes evident that an optimal \u03b3th exists that maximizes the achievable throughput. The optimal \u03b3th depends on the transmission SNR \u03b3s as well as the level of transceivers hardware imperfections. In more detail, for a given \u03b3s, as the level of hardware imperfections increases, the optimal \u03b3th shifts to lower values. For instance, for \u03b3s = 40 dB, as \u03bat = \u03bar changes from 0 to 0.2, the optimal \u03b3th shifts from 22 to 10.3 dB. Furthermore, for fixed \u03b3s and \u03b3th, as \u03bat = \u03bar increases, the achievable throughput decreases. For example, for \u03b3s = 30 dB and \u03b3th = 30 dB, the achievable throughput decreases from 3.46 to 1.8 bits/s/Hz, as \u03bat = \u03bar increases from 0 to 0.2. Moreover, for a fixed level of transceiver hardware imperfections, the optimal \u03b3th takes higher values, as \u03b3s increases. Finally, from this figure, we verify that for \u03b3th \u2265 1\u03ba2t+\u03ba2r , the achievable throughput is equal to 0."
