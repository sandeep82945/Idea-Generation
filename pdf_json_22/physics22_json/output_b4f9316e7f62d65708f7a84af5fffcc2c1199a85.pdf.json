            "text": "Under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, the chemistry of materials, as we know it, changes drastically, making it possible to access new states of matter. Thus, experimental and theoretical research under extreme conditions have been fundamental in their contribution to geophysics, planetary sciences, and mineralogy, as well as to the characterization of new materials of technological interest and their respective phase diagrams, leading to a better understanding of their physical and chemical properties. In this sense, the fundamental study of diatomic molecules of single elements with low atomic numbers subjected to high-pressure conditions, has been the subject of great interest by the scientific community due to the theoretical and experimental detection of phenomena, such as the eventual metallization induced by pressure or phase transformations observed in analogous mono-atomic systems such as nitrogen [1,2] and the halogen elements [3\u20136]. Fluorine is the first of the halogens and the last of the diatomic elements of the first row in the periodic table. It was chosen as the study object of this work given its similarities with hydrogen and the high energy density of its electronic bonds, likewise, it is an abundant element in the universe and is particularly interesting for its high oxidizing capacity and for having the highest electronegativity among all elements, followed by oxygen\u2019s.\nDespite the above reasons, fluorine has not been studied very extensively if compared to other single-element diatomic molecules (H2, N2, O2, Cl2, Br2, and I2). For instance, the space group of solid fluorine at high pressure remained controversial for many years because two different structures were proposed through spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations, respectively [7\u201310]. Experiments were carried out using diamond anvil cells (DAC), but it was very challenging to obtain reliable results [10,11]. In addition to the very small sample sizes that are typical of experiments involving DACs, other technical difficulties came from the fact that fluorine and other halogen elements are characterized by being volatile, corrosive, and highly reactive, increasing the complexity level when studied in the lab. For this reason, it was not until a few years ago that, by using computational techniques, a study established that theC2/c structure is energetically more stable thanC2/m, which then transforms intoCmca at 8 Giga-Pascals (GPa) [12] and not reporting any other structural transformation up to the pressurelimit of that work, which was 100 GPa. In their study, Olson et al. [13] spanned a higher pressure range covering up to a few Tera-Pascals (TPa); not only they corrected the transition from C2/c to Cmca by placing it at 70 GPa, but also reported a phase transition toP42/mmc and then toPm3\u0304n, at 2.5 and 3.0 TPa, respectively. Additionally, the study by Olson et al. [13] included a structural search component: their work made use of a methodology that has undergone recently a process of refinement called Symmetry Driven Structure Search (SYDSS) [14]; this method is based on sampling space groups and Wyckoff positions to propose new crystal structures. In Ref. [13], the structural search for highpressure phases received as starting point a set of structures previously reported for lower pressures and some restrictions were imposed to generate new systems,i.e., the bond lengths and the number of atoms in the molecules. More recently, Duanet al. [15] presented enthalpy relations for some predicted phases of fluorine up to 30 TPa based on theab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) method [16]. In the structural sequence reported in that work, fluorine undergoes two intermediate transitions, namelyP6/mmc andPm3\u0304n, at 2.7 and 4.0 TPa, respectively, before dissociating into the Fddd atomic phase at 30 TPa.\nGiven the substantial differences observed in recent the-\noretical reports at TPa pressures for solid fluorine, validating\nthe structures found in Refs. [13, 15] is necessary. For this\nstudy, we chose the computational tool for crystal structure determination known as USPEX [17\u201320], which is currently one of the most reliable codes used within the materials science community and combinesab-initio methods with structure prediction techniques based on evolutionary algorithms. In the past, USPEX has been able to predict new phases of materials at high pressure, including some up to 350 GPa that are relevant to the Earth\u2019s interior, allowing new ways of understanding matter at extreme conditions.\nIn this work, we tested USPEX\u2019s abilities by performing meticulous structural searches of fluorine crystalline phases, varying the number of atoms per unit cell and repeating this process at different volumes that correspond to TPa conditions of pressure. All this, interfaced with Quantum ESPRESSO [21,22] as the selected tool for accurateab-initio structural relaxations, as detailed in the Methods section. The Results and Discussion section provides our research\u2019s findings and analysis for several candidate-structures. Finally, we present our main conclusions in the last section, by providing answers regarding the coordination nature, electronic character and range of stability of fluorine\u2019s high pressure phases in the range from 1 to 5 TPa."

Over the past years, the likelihood of obtaining reliable results with computing methods for crystal structure prediction has been improved substantially. In this work, we have selected the USPEX package for its proven robustness in pressure regimes similar to the one of this study. In the initial stage we used USPEX to successfully generate good candidate structures for solid fluorine, followed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the structural optimization and refinement of selected candidate phases at different pressures. In addition, the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) scheme allowed us to determine the dynamical stability of the structures that were found, from vibrational data."

It is then necessary to perform a structural relaxation to decrease and determine the total internal energy of each candidate system and use that value as a fitness criterion. Then, after a purely random start, new generations are created via genetic operations which can apply criteria such as heredity, mutation, and permutation; nevertheless, a portion of the new structures is still made randomly to ensure a level of diversity in each generation. The structural search ends when one of these criteria is achieved: no newbest structureis generated for a certain number of generations, or, the set value for the maximum number of generations is reached.\nHere, fixed composition searches were conducted to determine suitable high-pressure phases for solid fluorine. USPEX-based structure predictions were performed independently on different cell sizes, containing 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 atoms, in a pressure range spanning from 1.0 to 5.0 TPa in steps of 0.5 TPa, with the exception of 1.5 TPa that was not considered explicitly in this work but interpolated instead. Also, the two biggest cell sizes (12 and 16 atoms) were studied at four selected pressures instead of eight, and interpolated for the other pressures in that same range. The USPEX calculations started with an initial population of 30 structures, generated randomly with no restrictions on the space groups that could be assigned to the structures. In addition, no seeds or anti-seeds were considered. Subsequent generations were produced by applying the following variation operations (in parenthesis are the weights used in this work):\nRev. Mex. Fis.69041606\nheredity (50%), soft-mutation (15%), lattice mutation (10%), and permutation (5%), while the rest of the newly generated structures (20%) were still randomly produced with the random symmetric structure generator to assure diversity as explained earlier. We set the maximum number of generations to 50, and the convergence criterion was set to 20 repetitions of the same prediction. All USPEX calculations ended by reaching therepeated best structureconvergence criterion."

As explained earlier, the first generation of each run consists of randomly generated structures. After that, the act of creating a new candidate structure usually follows a two-step procedure. First, the evolutionary algorithm enables the generation of a new system using one of three operations [17\u201320]:\n\u2022 Heredity combines two or more parent structures to create a new one, allowing a broad search of the energy landscape while preserving fragments of good structures.\n\u2022 Permutationrandomly swaps chosen pairs of atoms within the unit cell, which facilitates finding the optimal ordering of the atoms.\nFIGURE 1. Enthalpy distribution, in eV per atom, of structures generated during 40 different runs for fluorine with 2-16 atoms per unit cell and at 1-5 TPa. The symbols represent the origin of generated structures: random generation (yellow circles) or as a result of certain genetic operations: heredity (blue squares), permutation (grey rhombus), lattice mutation (orange triangles), and soft mutation (green dash).\n\u2022 Mutation creates a child structure from a single parent, retaining some characteristics from it while introducing new structural features. There are two main types of mutations:lattice mutation, that randomly distorts the cell shape, allowing a better exploration of the neighborhood of parent structures and preventing premature convergence of the lattice; andsoft-mutation, which moves the atoms along the eigenvectors of the softest modes in order to create a new structure across the lowest energy barrier, allowing a local and semilocal exploration of the energy landscape.\nEach run contemplates the use of the genetic operations described above, together with a percentage of randomly generated structures. Figure 1 shows the enthalpy distribution of the generated systems within all 40 runs performed. We can see that randomly generated structures (yellow circles) with those from permutation operations (grey rhombus) and up to some extent also the ones from soft mutation (green dashes) span a large energy interval. In contrast, most relevant structures are created due to heredity (blue squares) and lattice mutation (orange triangles)."

An additional closer inspection demonstrated that some phases were very similar to each other: in those cases the ones with lower symmetry were, in fact, slightly distorted cells of those with higher symmetry, with differences of around 1% in their\nRev.

This realization allowed us to narrow the list down to 9 structures:C2/m\u2212 2, Immm, I4/mmm, Fm3\u0304m, C2/m \u2212 6, C2/c, Cmca, P42/mmc, and Pm3\u0304n. More detailed calculations were carried out for the final set of structures. For instance, additional physical properties were calculated using Quantum ESPRESSO with a projector-augmented wave pseudopotential including seven valence electrons. For all final calculations, the kinetic energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was 200 Ry and their correspondent k-point grid for the Bril-\nlouin zone integration provided a total energy difference con-\nvergence of 2 meV per atom or better. The details are dis-\nplayed in Table II.\nFigure 2 shows the case of 8 atoms per cell at selected\npressures after variable-cell optimization fromab initio re-\nsults for the forces and cell stresses. USPEX was able to predict those phases proposed in previous works [13, 15] after just a few iterations. The insets show structures with the best individual enthalpy per atom at each generation; the squares mark the minimum enthalpy corresponding to different space groups:C2/c (red), Fmmm (brown), Cmca (orange),I4/mmm (blue), andPm3\u0304n (purple). Each green rhombus indicates the relative enthalpy of other structures obtained with USPEX and those reported in Refs. [13, 15] are in gray and pink circles, respectively.\nFigure 3, the enthalpy relations for the structures found in this work, along with those previously proposed, are represented. The molecular phaseCmca remains stable up to\nFIGURE 3. Enthalpy relations of the structures found with the USPEX code and those reported in Refs.

Fis.69041606\n2.7(3) TPa. This persistence of the phaseCmca up to the terapascal regime was also reported in Ref. [15], and our USPEX calculations confirm that statement.Cmca transforms directly intoPm3\u0304n, which was also reported as a stable form for solid fluorine by Olsonet al. [13] and Duanet al. [15]. Nevertheless, in those two previous references thePm3\u0304m phase emerges at a higher pressure and after a reported intermediate phase:P42/mmc for Ref. [13] andP6/mmc for Ref. [15], which represent contradictory findings. In fact, our USPEX results found the phaseP42/mmc (green line in Fig. 3) which shows an interesting tendency, but its enthalpy is not the lowest at any pressure within the range of our current study, although the situation could change at higher pressures. On the other hand, since theP6/mmc structure reported in Ref. [15] did not appear in the USPEX search because it has 14 atoms per cell, we included it manually in our calculations and its enthalpy is also plotted (violet line in Fig. 3). However, same as forP42/mmc, P6/mmc also does not become the most stable within our pressure range, therefore, our results do not support the findings from previous works regarding the existence of an intermediate phase betweenCmca andPm3\u0304n at zero temperature. Regarding the two most stable structures found in this work, we can conclude thatCmca is a molecular phase, since, for example at 1.0 TPa, the nearest F\u2013F distance is calculated as 1.28\u030aA, and the second nearest F\u2013F distance is\nRev. Mex. Fis.69041606\n1.55A\u030a, which clearly establishes the molecular character of this crystalline structure which is shown in Fig. 4a). On the other hand, the phasePm3\u0304n is composed of two types of F atoms as shown in Fig. 4b): 75% of them (in gray) are polymer linear (1D) chains that go along the lattice vectors, and the remaining 25% (in yellow) are atoms located in the otherwise empty space between the linear chains, as shown in Fig. 4b). The mixed polymeric-atomic F character in phase Pm3\u0304n is consistent with the reports from Refs. [13, 15]. At 4.0 TPa, the distance between atoms within the polymeric chain is 1.26\u030aA, and the closest distance between an atom located in an interstice and an atom in a linear chain is 1.40A\u030a.\nhas been established through phonon calculations which\ndemonstrate that they are stable as a function of pressure across the phase transition, as represented in Fig. 5. From a mechanical perspective, an observed increase in frequencies with increasing pressure shows that the phonon modes of phasesCmca andPm3\u0304n become stiffer, hinting to a more rigid structure. This observation is significant as it suggests that these structures are able to withstand increased stress and deformation without undergoing structural deformation or collapse.\nIn addition to the phonon calculations, electronic band structures were also computed on both systems. At pressures below and above the transition, phasePm3\u0304n was found to be a metal according to an absence of gap at the Fermi level in its electronic band structure [Figs. 6c) and d)]. On the other hand,Cmca is a wide-gap semiconductor and our calculations revealed that at 2.5 TPa [Fig. 6a)] it has a band-gap of\n2.6 eV which increases to 2.9 eV at 3.5 TPa [Fig. 6b)]. The behavior or this band-gap as a function of pressure is shown in Fig. 7 for the pressure range spanned in this study, showing an unusual behavior below 4.5 TPa, since, for most materials, applying pressure is a well known way to induce metallization, still, fluorine is not alone in this exotic behavior [26] where the ability to lower the energy by forming insulating closed-shell electronic structures wins over the tendency to lower the energy of the system by delocalizing the electrons. Finally, as expected, it is observed that the contributions to the total electronic density of states (DOS) for the two main phases in this study come primarily from the orbitalp, rather than orbitals, however, while for the case ofPm3\u0304n the projection on the orbitals is basically non-existing at energies that are close or above the Fermi energy, the contribution of\nRev. Mex. Fis.69041606\nthat same orbital appears clearly also above the Fermi level for the case ofCmca, pointing to a sp-type of hybridization in that molecular phase."

            "text": "In summary, the evolutionary structural search approach implemented in the USPEX code, supported by DFT for calculating forces and stresses, has been tested at pressure conditions spanning several TPa. We corroborated the existence of a transition from the widely stableCmca molecular form of fluorine towards a non-molecular phase that is composed of a mixture of linear chains and isolated atoms. So far, the stability of a pure element\u2019s molecular solid is one of the highest in fluorine, rivaled only by oxygen that also shares with fluorine its high electronegativity, confirming the heuristic expectation that these two elements should behave similarly in many ways, among which, being reluctant to become fully polymeric. In fact, an increase in phonon frequencies forCmca shows that its molecular structure seems to get hardened and more dynamically stable upon compression, at least up to 4.5 TPa when a decrease in its electronic band-gap starts appearing. Previous contradictory reports of intermediate stable phases existing in the transition betweenCmca andPm3\u0304n\nwere not supported here at zero temperature and, even if it is fair to admit that the energy differences between competing candidates are too small, our results for the stable phases are well converged and do no suffer from numerical errors since within this level of theory they are consistent across many iterations of the structural search process and also at every pressure that was tested in this study. Although beyond of the scope of this work, the phase changes reported here at high pressure may be the initial step towards further work on this element,i.e., calculating the finite temperature contributions to the free energy for determining how the relative stability of the different structures may change. Finally, this work may be the inspiration for exploring the behavior of other halogen elements at high pressure."
