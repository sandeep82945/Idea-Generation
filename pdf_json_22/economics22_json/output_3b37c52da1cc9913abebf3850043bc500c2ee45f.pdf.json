    "abstractText": "The COVID-19 pandemic has become a challenge to public health systems worldwide. As of June 2022, more than 545 million cases have been registered worldwide, more than 6.34 million of which have died. The gratuitous and bloody war launched by Russia in Ukraine has affected the public health system, including disruptions to COVID-19 vaccination plans. The use of simulation models to estimate the necessary coverage of COVID-19 vaccination in Ukraine will make it possible to rapidly change the policy to combat the pandemic in the wartime. This study aims to develop a COVID-19 vaccination model in Ukraine and to study the impact of war on this process. The study is multidisciplinary and includes a sociological study of the attitude of the population of Ukraine toward COVID-19 vaccination before the escalation of the war, the modeling of the vaccine campaign, forecasting the required number of doses administered after the start of the war, epidemiological analysis of the simulation results. This research targeted the COVID-19 epidemic process during the war. The research subjects are the methods and models of epidemic process simulation based on statistical machine learning. Sociological analysis methods were applied to achieve this goal, and an ARIMA model was developed to assess COVID-19 vaccination coverage As a result of the study, the population of Ukraine was clustered in attitude to COVID-19 vaccination. As a result of a sociological study of 437 donors and 797 medical workers, four classes were distinguished: supporters, loyalists, conformists, and skeptics. An ARIMA model was built to simulate the daily coverage of COVID-19 vaccinations. A retrospective forecast verified the model's accuracy for the period 01/25/22 02/23/22 in Ukraine. The forecast accuracy for 30 days was 98.79%. The model was applied to estimate the required vaccination coverage in Ukraine for the period 02/24/22 \u2013 03/25/22. Conclusions. A multidisciplinary study made it possible to assess the adherence of the population of Ukraine to COVID-19 vaccination and develop an ARIMA model to assess the necessary COVID-19 vaccination coverage in Ukraine. The model developed is highly accurate and can be used by public health agencies to adjust vaccine policies in wartime. Given the barriers to vaccination acceptance, despite the hostilities, it is necessary to continue to perform awareness-raising work in the media, covering not only the events of the war but also setting the population on the need to receive the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for previously unvaccinated people, and a booster dose for those who have previously received two doses of the vaccine, involving opinion leaders in such works.",

COVID-19 can occur as an acute respiratory viral infection of a mild course or a severe form. The virus can infect various organs through direct infection or the body's immune response. Complications include viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure, multiple organ failure, septic shock, venous thromboembolism, and others [1].\nThe outbreak began in December 2019 in Wuhan,\nChina. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic. As of June 2022, more than 545 million cases have been registered worldwide, more than\n6.34 million of which have died.\nThe global pandemic has also stimulated the devel-\nopment of research on using digital tools to control epidemic processes. Many scientific groups have focused on the development of data-driven tools for diagnosing morbidity [2], data processing [3], research on external factors [4], social impacts on a pandemic [5], medical data security [6], etc.\nVaccination is the most effective way to protect\nyourself from COVID-19, prevent the spread of new strains, and stop the pandemic. Vaccination protects against severe illness, hospitalization, and death if infected with COVID-19 [7]. Since April 2020, medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies have developed and tested more than 40 vaccines against COVID-19. Mass vaccination against COVID-19 began in December\n Dmytro Chumachenko, Tetyana Chumachenko, Nataliia Kirinovych,\nIevgen Meniailov, Olena Muradyan, Olga Salun, 2022\nModelling and digitalization\n21\n2020 in the United States and several other countries. As of June 2022, almost 12 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, 5.2 billion people have been vaccinated with at least one dose, and 4.7 billion have completed the entire course of vaccination [8]. In Ukraine, the vaccination campaign started on February"

            "text": "Exactly one year later, on February 24, 2022, Russia\nstarted a war in Ukraine for no reason. In addition to colossal destruction and human casualties, the war brought a humanitarian crisis to Ukraine, which also affected the public health sector. In particular, the war also affected the spread of viral diseases. Active hostilities, the temporary occupation of certain regions by Russia, and the redistribution of healthcare resources for military needs have practically stopped the vaccine campaign against COVID-19. At the same time, at the start of the war, Ukraine was at the stage of increasing incidence [9].\nThe study aims to develop a vaccination model\nagainst COVID-19 in Ukraine and to study the impact of war on this process. The study is multidisciplinary and includes a sociological study of the attitude of the population of Ukraine to vaccination against COVID-19 before the escalation of the war, modeling of the vaccine campaign, and forecasting the required number of doses administered after the start of the war, epidemiological analysis of the simulation results. The research is targeted at the COVID-19 epidemic process during the war. The research subjects are methods and models of epidemic process simulation based on statistical machine learning.\nTo achieve the aim of the research following tasks\nhave been formulated:\n1. Methods and models of the COVID-19\nvaccination should be analyzed;\n2. Method of the sociological estimation of attitude\nto vaccination against COVID-19 in Ukraine should be developed;\n3. A simulation model of the COVID-19\nvaccination based on autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method should be developed;\n4. Verification of ARIMA model should be\nprovided;\n5. Sociological investigation on COVID-19\nvaccination attitude in Ukraine should be provided;\n6. Estimation of COVID-19 vaccination plan\nduring the first month of the war in Ukraine should be provided;\n7. Results obtained during the experimental\nstudies should be analyzed.\nThe respective contribution of this study is three-\nfold. Firstly, the cluster analysis of attitude toward vaccination against COVID-19 in Ukraine based on sociological approaches will allow correcting the vaccination policies. Secondly, the development of ARIMA model will allow estimating the accuracy of simple machine\nlearning methods applied to the simulation of the COVID-19 vaccination dynamics in Ukraine. Thirdly, simulation results will allow us to assess the actual state of the COVID-19 vaccination in Ukraine during the war, which will allow us to identify the necessary measures to combat the pandemic.\nIn this paper, section 1, namely the current research\nanalysis, provides the current state of COVID-19 vaccination strategies simulation methods and models. Section 2, namely Data Analysis, describes the background of the vaccination against COVID-19 in Ukraine and analyses the data sources used in the research. Section 3, namely Materials and Methods, provides a methodology of sociological research, a brief overview of the ARIMA model, and verification methods of the prognostic models. Section 4 provides the results of cluster analysis of attitude toward vaccination in Ukraine, verification of the model of vaccination against COVID-19 in Ukraine, and estimation of necessary vaccination plan in Ukraine during the war. The discussion section discusses the obtained results from the epidemiology view. Conclusions describe the outcomes of the investigation.\nGiven research is part of a project on development\nof complex intelligent information system for epidemiological diagnostics, the concept of which is discussed in [10]."

            "text": "In this article, we are investigating the COVID-19\nvaccine campaign in Ukraine, so it is necessary to review existing studies to model COVID-19 vaccination.\nThe paper [11] reviewed a COVID-19 model with a\ndouble-dose vaccination strategy for outbreak control in Bangladesh. Modeling is based on a compartmental approach. The study results show that the full-dose vaccination program significantly reduces the number of mild and critical cases and can potentially contribute to eradicating the virus in a particular area. The study [12] also proposes a compartmental approach to model COVID-19 given vaccination. The authors show that the critical vaccination threshold depends on the vaccine's effectiveness in eradicating the disease at any time, even if vaccination coverage is high. The results of a pilot study on cumulative incidence data in Senegal show that despite the effectiveness of vaccination and treatment of COVID-19, additional efforts, such as non-pharmacological public health interventions, should continue to mitigate the spread of the virus. The authors of [13] propose a deterministic compartmental model and a stochastic branching process model to assess the impact of the deployment of a vaccine campaign in New Zealand on the potential spread and health impact of COVID-19. A threshold for required vaccination to contain the current pandemic has\nISSN 1814-4225 (print)\nRadioelectronic and Computer Systems, 2022, no. 3(103) ISSN 2663-2012 (online) 22\nbeen calculated. However, since such coverage is unlikely to be achievable in practice, complete relaxation of control could lead to severe consequences for spreading the virus. However, the study shows that the higher the vaccination coverage, the greater the herd immunity in the population, and the easier it will be to control new outbreaks.\nThe study [14] aims to investigate the reasons for\naccepting or rejecting COVID-19 vaccines among the Malaysian population. As a result of modeling based on a sociological study, the authors show that the majority of respondents consider the vaccine to be safe, effective, protective, and provide herd immunity. At the same time, an obstacle to vaccination is unknown long-term side effects, the rapid production of the vaccine, and the fear of halal status.\nThe authors of [15] propose a mathematical model\nof COVID-19 to assess the short-term impact of various vaccination scenarios in Lebanon. Simulation results have shown that vaccination has an impact in the short term. Expansion must be rapid and achieve high coverage (at least 70%) while maintaining social distancing measures during deployment. The work [16] proposes a model of the COVID-19 epidemic to predict the effectiveness of vaccination in the United States. The model analyzes the effectiveness of vaccination in terms of vaccination effectiveness, vaccination planning, and relaxation of social measures that reduce disease transmission. Modeling results show that reducing the epidemic as vaccination is introduced depends critically on the extent to which social measures that reduce transmission of the disease are eased.\nThe article [17] is devoted to studying the effect of\nvaccines that have different efficacy after the first dose and after the second dose regimen, considering the different efficacy against severe disease and not against widespread infection. The model aims to investigate the effect of the vaccine in reducing hospitalizations in a short-term scenario in Spain, with a population under mixed vaccination conditions. Modeling results justify the population coverage needed to achieve herd immunity. The study [18] aims to develop a deterministic compartmental epidemic response model with limited supply and mass vaccination to evaluate vaccination scenarios in New South Wales, Australia. The simulation results showed that herd immunity is possible with the vaccination of 66% of the population. At the same time, using vaccines with an efficiency of less than 70% cannot provide herd immunity and will lead to a constant risk of outbreaks.\nArticle [19] proposes a stochastic compartmental\nmodel for evaluating the effectiveness of a vaccine against the symptomatic disease. Using the model, experiments were carried out for three scenarios, distinguishing between the vaccine's effectiveness against infection,\ninfectivity, and symptoms. As a result, the authors conclude that the vaccination of medical personnel is essential for their protection and for reducing the number of cases among residents of nursing homes. The authors of [20] discuss how the models have been applied to health policy decisions related to COVID-19 vaccination and how they can be applied in the future in the context of booster doses under various scenarios associated with specific disease factors. The article shows that combining segmental and network models can improve the power and reliability of epidemiological forecasts.\nReview [21] considers epidemiological and eco-\nnomic modeling data for priority populations to minimize mortality, transmission, and incidence of COVID-19. The analysis results confirmed the recommendations of WHO regarding the priority of vaccines against COVID19. However, there is a gap in data on optimal prioritization for low- and middle-income countries.\nAnalysis of studies showed that most scientific\ngroups use a compartmental approach to model vaccination against COVID-19. However, the lack of disparate data on the war conditions in Ukraine does not allow applying the approach for modeling on the territory of the country. Therefore, this article proposes developing a COVID-19 vaccination model using statistical machine learning methods."

Preparations for the start of the vaccine campaign were carried out taking into account the recommendations of WHO, which in its documents emphasized that national strategies for vaccination against COVID-19 should be adapted taking into account the characteristics of the country's health systems and national context, the volume and pace of vaccine supply and characteristics and risk assessment - benefits for various population groups [22]. In Ukraine, potential target groups and vaccination strategies have been identified and a Roadmap for vaccination of the population of Ukraine [23] has been developed to achieve the following goals:\n to reduce the number of deaths associated with\nCOVID-19 coronavirus disease;\n to reduce the severity and number of health com-\nplications associated with COVID-19.\nIt was determined that the main objective of the\nRoadmap for vaccination during 2021-2022 is to cover at least 50% of the population of Ukraine (20,866,390 people) with vaccination against the coronavirus disease\nModelling and digitalization\n23\nCOVID-19. Voluntary vaccination against COVID-19 was envisaged for all population groups and occupational groups.\nApproaches to the implementation of a vaccination\nprogram are largely dependent on the availability of vaccines. At the start of the vaccine campaign, production capacity was unable to meet all of the global demand for a COVID-19 vaccine. Global demand was predicted to outstrip the vaccine production capacity of manufacturers throughout 2021 and 2022. Therefore, based on the recommendations of WHO, SAGE 17, and ETAGE, the Preliminary Framework for the Equitable Distribution of the COVID-19 Vaccine (The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, USA), the recommendations of the National Immunization Technical Expert Panel of Ukraine, it was recommended to allocate nine priority groups for COVID-19 disease, including (in order of priority for access to vaccination) [24, 25]:\n1. Medical workers, including those directly\ninvolved in measures to counter the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.\n2. Military personnel (including the Armed Forces\nof Ukraine and the National Guard of Ukraine) participating in the Joint Forces Operation.\n3. Social workers, including social workers. 4. Persons living in institutions providing long-\nterm care and support, and employees of such institutions.\n5. The elderly (60 years and older), including those\nwith comorbidities who are at risk of developing complications and death due to COVID-19 disease (people diagnosed with diseases of the endocrine system, cardiovascular diseases, chronic diseases respiratory tract, chronic diseases of the nervous system, chronic diseases of the urinary system, oncological diseases, chronic diseases of the hematopoietic organs and blood).\n6. Employees of critical state security structures,\nincluding the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, the National Police of Ukraine, the National Guard of Ukraine, the Security Service of Ukraine, military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n7. Teachers and other education workers. 8. Adults (aged 18 to 59 years) with comorbidities\nwho are at risk of developing complications and death due to COVID-19 disease (people diagnosed with diseases of the endocrine system, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases pathways, chronic diseases of the nervous system, chronic diseases of the urinary system, oncological diseases, chronic diseases of the hematopoietic organs and blood).\n9. People who are in places of restriction of\nfreedom and/or pre-trial detention centers and employees of places of restriction of liberty and/or pre-trial detention centers.\nWhen developing the National Plan for the Intro-\nduction of the Vaccine and Conducting Mass Vaccination against COVID-19, 4 stages were envisaged, indicating the exact timing, volumes of vaccination, and target groups, later a 5th stage was added, which included the vaccination of other categories of the population that were not included in the first four stages. It was assumed that one target group would be vaccinated during one stage, vaccination was carried out on two platforms - mobile and mobile teams and in primary health care facilities. Later, Mass Vaccination Centers were organized, where the population could also be vaccinated against COVID-19.\nThe peculiarities of the vaccination campaign in\nUkraine were a large target group, which required priority vaccination against COVID-19, comprising more than 50 % of the population of Ukraine; the expected duration of vaccination; the use of new vaccines in the world obtained by new technologies; overburdened healthcare system. The process of organizing vaccination in Ukraine in response to the pandemic was organized and managed by the Ministry of Public Health and the Center for Public Health, a strong vertical coordination was built with direct supervision of the introduction of vaccination and feedback. At each stage, consultations were held with the regions, flexibility was provided only within the framework of approved scenarios, and responsibility for each decision was clearly articulated. These were the key principles for organizing vaccination against COVID-19 in Ukraine.\nThe vaccination course included two doses of the\nvaccine, which were administered at intervals of 4-12 weeks, depending on the type of vaccine.\nOn December 22, 2021, revaccination was intro-\nduced in Ukraine - a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for medical workers and workers in residential care homes. She began to vaccinate on December 24th. All vaccinated, regardless of the target group, were able to receive a booster dose of the vaccine on January 6, 2022.\nOn February 2, 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers of\nUkraine adopted the National COVID-19 Vaccination Plan for 2022, according to which the overall strategy for COVID-19 vaccination began to consist of a booster dose for those who had already received the basic vaccination course in 2021, and vaccination of those who did not receive a single dose. Additionally, in 2022, it was planned to cover children and adolescents aged 12 to 18 with vaccinations. The document also provided for the obligation of the regional and Kyiv city state administrations to ensure vaccination coverage of minors and at least 70 % of adults, including 80 % of people over 60 years of age. Particular attention continued to be given to those at risk. In addition, the document has a norm that provides for the creation of regional interdepartmental coordination commissions for its implementation and the approval of\nISSN 1814-4225 (print)\nRadioelectronic and Computer Systems, 2022, no. 3(103) ISSN 2663-2012 (online) 24\nregional vaccination plans for 2022.\nAlso in Ukraine, the supply of vaccine preparations\nwas established, which made it possible to freely obtain the required dose of vaccine for the population of Ukraine.\nDespite the efforts made, as of February 23, 2022, a\nyear after the start of the vaccination campaign, 15,712,650 people were vaccinated in Ukraine, of which 15,712,648 people received the first dose, 15,175,097 people received two doses received an additional dose \u2013 27,458 people, a booster dose \u2013 701,836 people. A total of 31,617,039 vaccinations were done. At the same time, on February 23, 2022, 25,062 new cases of COVID-19 were registered, 297 deaths and 3,140 people were hospitalized."

The topic of the interview was the perception of the argumentation strategies for the introduction of mass vaccination (respondents were offered some statements about vaccination, which they could rate on a scale from \u201c1 \u2013 strongly disagree\u201d to \u201c5 \u2013 strongly agree\u201d):\n1. The safety of vaccination. 2. Compulsory vaccination. 3. Efficiency. 4. Alternative vaccination. (Dis)agreement with pro- and anti-vaccination\nstatements showed the chances for the conscious embodiment of discursive practices in real social practices (in N. Fairclough terminology) of vaccination. And the focus\non groups of donors and health workers is explained by the high level of involvement in vaccination discourse, so we can consider them as potential opinion leaders. The medical staff acts as representatives of evidence-based (\u201cofficial\u201d) medicine, has significantly grown since the beginning of the pandemic authority, and thus can form specific beliefs and positions on certain aspects of the pandemic. In this case, doctors are an influential agent in the formation of certain attitudes in the mass consciousness about vaccination. On the other hand, healthcare workers as representatives of the professional community are more likely than others to encounter SARS-CoV-2, and, accordingly, are more involved in immunization processes. In turn, plasma donors do not belong to the professional field of healthcare but are quite strongly associated with it in their everyday life. That is, they can be considered the most included non-professionals in the medical discourse, who have a great articulatory potential in the vaccination discourse.\nSo, we suppose to receive a relief date with the dif-\nference between the perception of vaccination by healthcare workers and those who are not involved in the medical system as a professional, but who are quite active and can have potential social influence. This will provide a more accurate picture of the prospects for vaccination in terms of social factors and possible social barriers. Surveys of two different social groups in terms of their involvement in the medical sphere will allow balancing the potential deviations due to the characteristics of each group. We will increase the value of the data since we analyze groups that can both act as \"locomotives\" of the ideological and informational promotion of vaccination if it is supported in the group consciousness, and prevent such promotion from broadcasting a negative attitude towards vaccination."

The ARIMA model combines AR (Autoregressive),\nand MA (Moving Average) approaches. Therefore, the model consists of three parts:\n AR (Autoregressive) is a regression model that\nuses the dependence between observations and the number of integrated observations p.\nModelling and digitalization\n25\n I (Integrated) provides stationarity by calculating\nthe differences d.\n MA (Moving Average) analyzes the relationship\nbetween observations and residuals when applying the model to integrated observations q.\nThus, the simple form of the p-order autoregressive\nmodel is:\nAR(p) = c + \u2211 \u03c6ixi\u22121 + \u03f5i p i=1 , (1)\nwhere xi are a stationary variable;\nc is a constant;\ni are autocorrelation coefficients; \u03f5i are white noise with zero mean.\nThe moving average order model q has the form:\nMA(q) = \u03bc + \u2211 \u03b8i\u03f5i\u22121 q i=1 , (2)\nwhere \u03bc is the mathematical expectation of the process;\n\u03b8i are weights; \u03b80 is assumed to be 1; \u03f5i are white noise with zero mean.\nThus, the ARIMA model of order p, q is a combi-\nnation of (1) and (2), and has the form:\nARIMA(p, q) = c +\u2211\u03c6ixi\u22121 + \u03f5i\np\ni=1\n+\n+\u2211 \u03b8i\u03f5i\u22121 q i=1 .

This is achieved by taking differences.\nTo tune the model, the data is checked for station-\narity and compliance with the moving average. The initial data analysis prepares them for forecasting by determining the parameters p, d, and q. As a training sample, we used data on vaccination against COVID-19 in Ukraine from February 24, 2021 (the start date of the vaccine campaign against COVID-19 in Ukraine) to January 24, 2022.

As of June 2022, more than 545 million cases have been registered worldwide, more than 6.34 million of which have died.\nA significant achievement in the fight against the\npandemic has been the development of safe and effective vaccines among non-pharmaceutical methods to contain the spread of the virus. To select the optimal and rational methods for controlling the epidemic process of COVID19, such a tool as mathematical modeling is widely used. This method has proven itself to predict the dynamics of the spread of infection [29], determine the necessary immune layer [30], identify factors affecting the dynamics of the epidemic process [31], evaluate the effectiveness of quarantines [32], pharmacological [33] and non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the incidence.\nBased on a time series analysis of COVID-19 vac-\ncination, the model presented in this study allows it to be used for decision-making in public health institutions with limited data for planning COVID-19 vaccination policy during the Russian war in Ukraine. The model showed what level of vaccination is needed to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of the war in Ukraine.\nAfter Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine,\nUkrainian healthcare was forced to devote all its efforts to helping wounded service members and the affected population. The civilian population suffered from mine and gunshot wounds, shell shock, mental attacks, mental health disorders, heart attacks, strokes, and other pathologies associated with the war. The volume of medical care that medical workers had to provide increased significantly. In addition, some medical workers, saving their lives and the lives of their families, moved to other regions of the country and foreign countries, which reduced the capacity of healthcare institutions. Many hospitals, dispensaries, diagnostic laboratories, and other health care facilities were destroyed. The attention of medical workers has switched from issues related to implementing preventive and anti-epidemic measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic to addressing issues related to the increase in the flow of the wounded and sick.\nAttacks on medical facilities and the destruction of\nhealthcare infrastructure are forcing people to refuse to seek medical care [35] and reducing the possibility of implementing a full-scale vaccine campaign against COVID-19 [36].\nOur research has shown that the population has dif-\nferent adherence to vaccination. Continued information attacks by Russian propagandists contribute to refusals to vaccinate even in those territories of Ukraine where there are no hostilities, and the population can freely receive vaccination [37].\nGiven the barriers to vaccination acceptance, de-\nspite the hostilities, it is necessary to continue to carry out awareness-raising work in the media, covering not only the events of the war but also setting the population on the need to receive the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for previously unvaccinated individuals, and a booster dose for those who previously received two doses of the vaccine, involving opinion leaders in such work. It is necessary to continue to develop and implement educational programs aimed at training different groups of the population in measures to prevent COVID-19. The effectiveness of educational programs has been shown by researchers [38]. It is advisable to introduce such programs at universities, especially when training medical workers who will subsequently educate the population.\nIt is also necessary to inform the population about\nthe current epidemic situation regarding COVID-19 in Ukraine - the number of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, etc., and highlight the pace of vaccination. This is necessary not only for the population of Ukraine and decisionmakers but also for the public health authorities of neighboring countries, where large flows of refugees have gone.\nConclusions\nThe paper is devoted to a multidisciplinary study of\nwartime COVID-19 vaccination in Ukraine using sociological analysis, simulation modeling, and epidemiological analysis.\nA sociological study of 437 donors and 797 medical\nworkers was conducted, which identified four clusters concerning vaccination in Ukraine: supporters, loyalists, conformists, and skeptics. An ARIMA model has been developed to estimate the required vaccination coverage against COVID-19 in Ukraine. For the pilot study, we used the data on vaccination against COVID-19 in Ukraine, posted in the World Health Organization Dashboard. Verification of the model using retrospective forecasting for the period 01/25/22 - 02/23/22 showed an accuracy of 98.79 %.\nThe scientific novelty of the study lies in the use of\nsociological research and simulation to assess the required vaccination coverage against COVID-19. The proposed approach showed high accuracy for various forecasting periods. This made it possible to estimate the required vaccination coverage against COVID-19 in Ukraine during the war.\nThe practical novelty of the study lies in the assess-\nment of the mandatory vaccination coverage against COVID-19 in Ukraine during wartime. The proposed tool is essential during active combat operations with limited human and computing resources. The resulting forecast will effectively make adjustments to the policies\nISSN 1814-4225 (print)\nRadioelectronic and Computer Systems, 2022, no. 3(103) ISSN 2663-2012 (online) 28\nto combat COVID-19 in Ukraine during the war.\nThe results of the study showed that, given the bar-\nriers to vaccination acceptance, despite the hostilities, it is necessary to continue to conduct awareness-raising work in the media, covering not only the events of the war but also setting the population on the need to receive the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for previously unvaccinated individuals, and a booster dose for those who previously received two doses of the vaccine, involving opinion leaders in such work.
