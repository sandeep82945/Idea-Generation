1. **Investigate the feasibility of establishing a Sovereign Public Sector Property Fund (SPSPF) in the United Kingdom.** This could involve conducting a pilot study to assess the interest of local authorities in participating in such a fund, as well as the potential benefits and challenges of doing so.


2. **Develop a framework for evaluating the performance of SPSPFs.** This framework could be used to track the progress of SPSPFs over time and to identify areas where they can be improved. It could also be used to compare the performance of SPSPFs to other types of investment vehicles, such as unlisted property funds.


3. **Examine the impact of SPSPFs on local communities.** This could involve conducting case studies of communities that have been affected by SPSPFs, as well as surveys of residents and businesses in these communities. The research could explore the social, economic, and environmental impacts of SPSPFs, as well as the ways in which they can be used to promote community development.


4. **Analyze the role of SPSPFs in the context of the knowledge economy.** This could involve examining the ways in which SPSPFs can be used to support the growth of knowledge-based industries and to create jobs in these industries. The research could also explore the ways in which SPSPFs can be used to attract and retain talent in knowledge-based industries.


5. **Develop a model for a SPSPF that can be replicated in other countries.** This could involve identifying the key elements of a successful SPSPF and developing a set of guidelines that can be used by other countries to establish their own SPSPFs. The research could also explore the potential benefits and challenges of establishing SPSPFs in different countries, as well as the ways in which SPSPFs can be adapted to meet the specific needs of different countries.
