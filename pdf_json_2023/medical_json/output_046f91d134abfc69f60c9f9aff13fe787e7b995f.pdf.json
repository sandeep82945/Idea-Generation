    "abstractText": "The European mink Mustela lutreola (Mustelidae) ranks among the most endangered mammalian species globally, experiencing a rapid and severe decline in population size, density, and distribution. Given the critical need for effective conservation strategies, understanding its genomic characteristics becomes paramount. To address this challenge, the platinum-quality, chromosomelevel reference genome assembly for the European mink was successfully generated under the project of the European Mink Centre consortium. Leveraging PacBio HiFi long reads, we obtained a 2586.3 Mbp genome comprising 25 scaffolds, with an N50 length of 154.1 Mbp. Through Hi-C data, we clustered and ordered the majority of the assembly (>99.9%) into 20 chromosomal pseudomolecules, including heterosomes, ranging from 6.8 to 290.1 Mbp. The newly sequenced genome displays a GC base content of 41.9%. Additionally, we successfully assembled the complete mitochondrial genome, spanning 16.6 kbp in length. The assembly achieved a BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) completeness score of 98.2%. This high-quality reference genome serves as a valuable genomic resource for future population genomics studies concerning the European mink and related taxa. Furthermore, the newly assembled genome holds significant potential in addressing key conservation challenges faced by M. lutreola. Its applications encompass potential revision of management units, assessment of captive breeding impacts, resolution of phylogeographic questions, and facilitation of monitoring and evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of dedicated conservation strategies for the European mink. This species serves as an example that highlights the paramount importance of prioritizing endangered species in genome sequencing projects due to the race against time, which necessitates the comprehensive exploration and characterization of their genomic resources before their populations face extinction.",

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, of the 5973 mammal species assessed, 1340 were classified as threatened with extinction, including 233 critically endangered taxa [1]. This number includes wild, non-domesticated,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14816. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241914816 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol.

This concerns the European mink Mustela lutreola L., 1761, a critically endangered, semiaquatic, secretive, and solitary representative of the mustelid family (Eukaryota; Metazoa; Chordata; Craniata; Vertebrata; Euteleostomi; Mammalia; Eutheria; Laurasiatheria; Carnivora; Caniformia; Mustelidae; Mustelinae; Mustela) [2,3] (Figure 1). The species is listed in the Annex II to the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the Annexes II and IV (priority species) of the Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, and in the Carpathian List of Endangered Species (critically endangered species), and considered one of the most endangered mammalian species in the world [4,5].

Following a combination of habitat loss and fragmentation, commercial over-hunting for fur and the effects of introduced, invasive American mink Neogale vison Schreber, 1777 lead to a dramatic depletion of the species\u2019 populations, in terms of both shrinkage of a geographical range by 97%, and a reduction in the number of individuals persisting in the wild to about 5000 [5\u20137]. What is more, an expected decline rate in number over the next three generations exceeds 80% [5]. These days, only three isolated, declining populations, restricted to the European part of Russia, the Danube Delta, south-western France and north-eastern Spain survived [5].

Of key importance for the effectiveness and efficiency of these measures are genomic research, informing targeted and evidence-based conservation strategies [9,10]. By studying the genomic makeup of the European mink, valuable insights into its population structure, genetic diversity, and evolutionary history can be gained. This knowledge is essential for understanding the unique adaptations and vulnerabilities of this species, as well as identifying and quantifying inbreeding, hybridization, and introgression [11\u201315]. Such information is vital for developing targeted conservation efforts, including captive breeding programmes, reintroduction and translocation strategies, and genetic management plans, to halt ongoing depletion of genetic diversity of M. lutreola sparse, local populations, and preserve their genetic integrity and long-term viability, ultimately aiding in their survival and recovery in the wild [8].\nComprehensive research of the genetic resources of a critically endangered species is of paramount importance from both cognitive and practical perspectives. Not only do we gain new knowledge, enable a deeper understanding of its biology and conservation needs, but we can also provide critical information for informed conservation decisionmaking. This knowledge is invaluable for collecting and preserving irreplaceable genetic heritage that is on the verge of being lost forever and unnoticed, particularly in the case of a non-charismatic, rare, and elusive species. Meanwhile, despite the alarming situation of the European mink, the number of studies on its genetics and genomics is limited and urgently need to be completed [8]. To date, there has not been a reference genome for the species, its mitochondrial genome was only sequenced in 2022, and no data were stored in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) in the GenBank [8,16].\nFigure 2.

            "text": "The genome sequencing of various mustelids has provided valuable insights into their genetic composition and evolutionary history. Out of the 67 species in the Mustelidae family, 17 have reference genome assemblies ready and deposited in GenBank, while only in the case of seven species has a chromosome-level assembly been achieved (Table 4) [18,19]. European mink stands as the only critically endangered species within this group that has now attained a reference genome of a platinum quality. A platinum genome is defined as a high-quality, near error-free and gapless, chromosome-level, haplotypephased, reference genome assembly [20,21]. Additionally, the following standards were drawn for the Vertebrate Genomes Project of the Genome 10K consortium: N50 size of at least 1 Mbp for contigs and 10 Mbp for scaffolds, sequence error frequency of up to 1 in 10,000 bp, structural variants confirmed by multiple technologies, at least 90% of the sequence assigned to chromosomes and haplotype-phased [21,22]. Furthermore, a standard VGP reference genome involves an automated workflow that combines long-read sequencing, linked-read sequencing, optical mapping, and Hi-C data, with a final manual curation step to enhance the genome assembly and minimize errors [20,23]. The genome sequence reported in this article was assembled following the VGP quality requirements and meets the abovementioned conditions.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14816 11 of 20\nThe size of the reported genome of a M. lutreola fits well with previously sequenced genomes of other representatives of the Mustela genus, being the biggest among the socalled ferret group, clustering the European polecat, the steppe polecat, the black-footed ferret, and the European mink [16,24,25]. The European mink genome assembly was found to be noticeably close in size and the GC-content to the earlier estimates, which predicted the genome size of the species to be around 2.411\u20132.474 Gbp and the GC content to be approximately 42%, based on the sequenced genomes of the ferret (MusPutFur1.0, GenBank assembly accession: GCF_000215625.1) and the European polecat (polecat_10x_lmp_bionano, GenBank assembly accession: GCA_902207235.1) [16]. The number of whole-chromosome pseudomolecules assembled in the European mink\u2019s reference genome (18 autosomes and two heterosomes) is consistent with a diploid chromosome number reported for this species (2n = 38) [26]. Such a diploid number of chromosomes is typical of the family Mustelidae, occurring in over 60% of its representatives [27]. The high-quality reference genome of European mink represents the fulfilment of earlier calls for whole-genome sequencing of this critically endangered species [8,28], marking a significant step forward in advancing our understanding of the species\u2019 genetic composition and promising to enhance conservation efforts. A platinum quality reference genome serves as a highly accurate and reliable resource for various research applications, including evolutionary studies, population genomics, comparative genomics and func-\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14816 12 of 20\ntional genomics [13,29]. Such reference genomes are particularly valuable for species of conservation concern, where accurate genomic information is crucial for effective conservation efforts and understanding the species\u2019 biology [10,13]. The significant application potential of genomics in addressing conservation problems is well-documented for various carnivorans, e.g., African wild dog Lycaon pictus, Eastern wolf Canis lupus lycaon, puma Puma concolor, Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus, and wolverine Gulo gulo [11,30\u201332]. The reference genome of the European mink can play a pivotal role in addressing the conservation problems faced by this species, enabling the revision of management units to effectively manage genetic diversity within populations and minimize the outbreeding risk associated with inter-population translocations, providing comprehensive insights into the impacts of captive breeding, resolving phylogeographic questions, and facilitating the evaluation of conservation program efficiency and effectiveness [8,33]. It is important to recognize that the application of genomics to conservation often encounters a significant challenge\u2014the high costs associated with molecular analyses. However, this is where advanced genomic tools come into play. Through techniques like whole-genome re-sequencing and reduced-representation approaches, conservation genomics offers a potential solution to mitigate these cost constraints, as these methodologies can reduce the number of markers required for analysis and monitoring projects in the field of conservation activities [11\u201315,33]. Comprehensive population genomics studies are crucial, as the limited data on interpopulation genetic diversity could significantly impede the effectiveness of captive breeding, reintroduction programs, and potential translocations for persisting wild populations of M. lutreola [28,34\u201337]. By analysing the genetic variation, relatedness between populations, and identifying adaptive traits loci, it aids in the establishment of appropriate management units for targeted conservation. One prominent example of the application of population genomics is the ongoing debate surrounding the potential inclusion of the Spanish conservation breeding initiative in the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for European mink [28]. Additionally, plans to obtain new founders from the wild Romanian population emphasize the importance of understanding historical population dynamics and connectivity between existing European mink populations [14,28]. Compared to traditional genetic approaches, the reference genome provides advanced genomic tools to investigate evolutionary relationships among different European mink populations. It helps in determining historical patterns of migration and divergence, shedding light on the species\u2019 phylogenomic and phylogeographic history [38,39]. Such understanding is essential for re-evaluating Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) and Management Units (MUs) for M. lutreola [34,40\u201342]. These units guide conservation actions based on distinct evolutionary lineages and aim to preserve the genetic diversity of the species [40,41]. Moreover, the reference genome of the European mink serves as a valuable tool in resolving uncertainties about its past distribution over continental Europe [43,44]. It helps identify regions of high genetic diversity, indicating historical refugia or areas of long-term stability for the species, as well as regions of genetic variation associated with adaptation to specific environments, habitat use, disease resistance, responses to changing conditions, or other crucial ecological factors [10,29]. Furthermore, it can provide insights into the evolutionary history of the species and its relationship with other mustelids. Another pressing concern in the European mink conservation revolves around the assessment of the impact of the conservation breeding process on the development of traits essential for survival in the wild, specifically focusing on the adaptation to captivity [8]. Farquharson et al. [45] reported strong effects of inbreeding on the European mink offspring fitness in the EEP captive breeding program, highlighting the importance of addressing genetic management. One of the factors that reduces reproductive success in captivity and reconstituted (reintroduced) populations is aggressive behaviour exhibited by males toward females, which can lead to their exclusion from mating [46,47]. However, without a clear understanding of the heritability of these personality traits, assessing the risk of reducing genetic variation in reintroduced populations due to the release of individuals with specific\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14816 13 of 20\npersonality types becomes challenging [46\u201348]. Furthermore, the reference genome can help to identify regions of the genome that are associated with local adaptation or specific traits relevant to survival in the wild [10,29]. This information can guide breeding strategies to ensure that valuable adaptive and survival traits are retained in captive populations, even when introducing new individuals to counteract inbreeding. By avoiding excessive inbreeding, the fitness and resilience of an offspring can be improved, increasing their chances of survival in both captive and future reintroduction settings. Genomic information is essential to examine the impact of reintroduced individuals on shaping the gene pools of wild populations to address potential issues of outbreeding and the risk of losing unique adaptations [40,43]. In this regard, genomic-scale analyses serve as a valuable tool in evaluating potential fitness losses, thus facilitating more informed decisions and enhancing the success of reintroduction and translocation efforts [10,13]. The reference genome can support conservation breeding strategies by assisting in the selection of founders for captive breeding programs. It also helps optimize breeding pairs and prevents over-representation of certain lineages, ensuring that individuals chosen for reproduction possess optimal genetic diversity and reduce the risk of inbreeding depression [10,13]. With the reference genome, it becomes feasible to conduct genome-wide monitoring of the European mink local populations. This allows researchers to track changes in genetic diversity, detect potential threats to specific populations, and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation interventions over time, across multiple generations. Understanding the genetic variation within and between populations can help identify populations with low genetic diversity, which may be at greater risk of inbreeding depression and reduced adaptive potential, as well as genetically unique and vulnerable populations. Conservation efforts can then prioritize these populations for targeted management and genetic supplementation if necessary (genetic rescue) [49]. Genome-scale monitoring provides real-time information on the genetic health and status of endangered species populations, enabling adaptive management strategies to ensure their long-term survival, recovery, and genetic health [50]. Adaptive management is a dynamic and flexible approach characterized by continuous revisions of conservation strategies based on genetic data and observed fitness outcomes, allowing for timely adjustments and improvements to enhance conservation effectiveness. In conclusion, embracing reference genome offers a powerful and comprehensive approach to address the conservation issues faced by M. lutreola, enhancing the prospects for its preservation and sustainable recovery. Future research directions in the European mink conservation genomics, based on the reported genome assembly, may involve building a reference pangenome to enable detailed population genomic studies, monitoring interpopulation genetic diversity patterns using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq, ddRAD), and conducting a genome-wide scan for runs of homozygosity (ROH) to detect signatures of selection and estimate inbreeding [15,29,51]. Many of the conservation issues observed in this species could have been prevented if decisions regarding the necessary actions were not made before obtaining knowledge about its genome, but resulted from it. The reported genome assembly also provides perspectives for planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating conservation interventions for other closely related taxa. The reference genome of the European mink can serve as a valuable reference for conducting reference-based assembly or designing primers for targeted sequencing of specific genomic locations in mustelids, whose genomes are yet to be fully revealed (e.g., Mustela eversmanii, Mustela sibirica, Mustela itatsi). In the context of large genome sequencing programs, the prioritization of species sequencing order becomes crucial, as it enables the optimization of funding allocation, research interest, and workload alignment, ensuring that endangered species receive the necessary resources and attention commensurate with their conservation urgency. By prioritizing the comprehensive research of genomic resources in critically endangered species like the European mink, we not only gain valuable knowledge for conservation\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14816 14 of 20\ndecision-making, but also preserve the irreplaceable genetic heritage that is on the brink of being lost forever. The relatively low research interest in the European mink is incongruent with its critical situation. This highlights the significance of promotional and informational campaigns aimed at drawing attention and raising awareness in society about its alarming threat of extinction, ultimately ensuring adequate focus and attention of the scientific community towards understanding and conserving this fascinating species, deserving effective protection."

The assembly was also contributed to by the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), whose assembly pipeline (v. 2.0) and style quality metrics were implemented and followed [21,52\u201354]. Samples were taken from two (mMusLut2 and mMusLut3) captive-born, adult, clinically healthy, closely related M. lutreola males (heterogametic sex), during a routine veterinary examination, in accordance with the principles of animal welfare. Sampled individuals are kept by the European mink conservation breeding facility of the Wildtier- und Artenschutzstation e.V.

Both sampled individuals presented phenotypic features typical for the species [2]. The samples were collected by Florian Brandes (veterinarian, the Wildtier- und Artenschutzstation e.V.), assisted by Jakub Skorupski and Przemys\u0142aw S\u0301mietana (both University of Szczecin), on 14 March 2022 in the Wildtier- und Artenschutzstation e.V. headquarters. Individual mMusLut2 (specimen M1207) was used for acquisition of the genome sequence and HiFi data generation, while individual mMustLut3 (specimen M1287) was used for scaffolding using Hi-C. Whole blood samples were sterile collected by a cephalic vein venipuncture under inhalant anaesthesia [55,56]. Approximately 0.75 mL of blood per individual was drawn into the BD Vacutainer\u00ae tube with K2 EDTA (Becton, Dickinson and Company, New Jersey, NJ, USA). The samples were immediately gently mixed by inverting the tubes 8\u201310 times to ensure proper anticoagulation and prevent clot formation prior to further laboratory analysis. After collection, the samples were snap-frozen at \u221280 \u25e6C to preserve the integrity of the biological material. The frozen tubes were packed in insulated containers with at least 10 kg of dry ice and shipped overnight to the Vertebrate Genomes Laboratory (VGL) at the Rockefeller University (New York, NY, USA), for further analyses. Ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) DNA was extracted from frozen samples using the Nanobind\u00ae Bionano Prep SP Dna isolation kit (Bionano Genomics Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) method, according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The Nanobind\u00ae magnetic disk applied, enabled automatic lysis, binding, washing and elution, and efficiently minimized fragmentation and preserved long DNA molecules required for accurate long-read sequencing.\nInt.

Sheared DNA was concentrated and cleaned using 0.45\u00d7 Ampure PB (Pacific Biosciences of California Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA). The concentration and length of the purified sheared DNA were evaluated with the QubitTM 3.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and the Femto Pulse system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

Pseudohaplotype assemblies (primary/principal and alternate) of mMusLut2 were scaffolded using the haplotype-specific Hi-C reads of mMusLut3, using both Hifiasm and YaHS version 1.2a.2+galaxy0 [60] tools. The abovementioned primary as-\nInt. J. Mol.

The alternate assembly, or haplotigs, includes the alternate loci from the other haplotype\u2019s heterozygous regions, and being less complete than the primary assembly, it lacks representation of homozygous regions [54]. The Hi-C analysis was performed using the Arima-HiC kit 2 (Arima Genomics Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA). Utilizing chromosome conformation Hi-C data, the primary assembly contigs were organized and linked into larger scaffolds [61]. The Hi-C reads were aligned to the genome assembly to generate a contact map, visualized using the PretextView v. 0.2.5 (https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextView (accessed on 1 June 2023)). By decomposing the sequencing data into k-length substrings, counting the occurrence of each k-mer, and determining its frequency, Meryl v. 1.4 enabled the generation of the k-mer profile [62]. Genome properties, including genome size, repetitiveness, and heterozygosity rates, were inferred from the k-mer histogram generated by Meryl using GenomeScope v. 2.0, a tool that utilizes sequencing reads using a kmer-based statistical approach [63]. The expected genome size was computed from the k-mer genome coverage. K-mers were also used for initial, reference-free genome profiling. The mitochondrial genome was assembled from PacBio High Fidelity reads, with the MitoHiFi v. 3.2 pipeline [64]. The NCBI Reference Sequence NC_056132.1 was used as a reference. The comparison with previously sequenced complete mitogenome sequences of M. lutreola, deposited in the GenBank (Accession No. NC_056132.1, MW197426.1, MW197425.1, MW197424.1, MT304869.1, MW197423.1), was conducted using BLASTN v. 2.14.1+ programme (Nucleotide collection, megablast option) [65]. The gfastats v. 1.3.6 [66] was applied to check for contamination and correct the assemblies at each assembly stage. The Merqury v. 1.3 platform [62] was used to perform quality control at the contiging and purging stages (estimation of the consensus Quality Value (QV) scores of the final assembly and k-mer completeness). The gfastats v. 1.3.6 tool [66] was also used to compute the number of scaffolds, average of scaffold lengths, number of gaps, L50, N50, and total assembled bases. The BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) scores, assessing the completeness and quality of genome assemblies by evaluating the presence and integrity of a set of highly conserved genes that are expected to be present as single copies in a given genome (vertebrata_odb10 dataset, n = 3354), were granted within the BUSCO v. 5.3.2 software, applying the Metaeuk 6.a5d39d9 and HMMsearch v. 3.1 gene predictor algorithms [67,68]. To improve overall assembly quality, gap filling, removing false duplications, collapsed repeats and very low coverage regions, as well as haplotigs purging was performed using the purge_dups v. 1.2.5+galaxy4 package [69], based on read depth. Parameters derived from the GenomeScope output were used to define cutoffs. Manual curation of final assembly was performed using HiGlass v. 1.11 [70] and PretextMap v. 0.1.9 [71] tools, to resolve potential mis-assemblies, missed joins, duplications and collapses, and remove any contaminants."
