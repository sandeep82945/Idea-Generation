"Moreover, after salivary–gastrointestinal digestion, AABP-2B still possessed good α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. During AABP-2B fermentation, the pH decreased significantly, whereas total SCFAs, including propionic, acetic, and n-butyric acids, significantly increased. Therefore, it is speculated that the changes in SCFAs may be related to the fermentation of AABP-2B by intestinal flora. Additionally, AABP-2B modified the composition of the intestinal flora by increasing the relative amounts of beneficial bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium, Prevotella, and Megasphaera. Furthermore, AABP-2B can alter the gut microbiota composition by inhibiting the growth of pathogens. Thus, AABP-2B may be used as a prebiotic or functional food to improve gut health. Meanwhile, there were certain limitations to this study. As in vitro studies are inherently different from in vivo research, the findings presented herein cannot be directly correlated with biological responses."
