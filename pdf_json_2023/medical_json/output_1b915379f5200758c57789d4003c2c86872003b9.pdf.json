    "abstractText": "Targeted therapy significantly impairs tumour growth but suffers from limitations, among which the \u2018flare\u2019 (\u2018rebound\u2019) effect. Among cancers driven by tyrosine kinase receptors, those relying on alterations of the MET oncogene benefit from treatment by specific inhibitors. Previously, we reported that discontinuation of MET tyrosine kinase receptor inhibition causes \u2018rebound\u2019 activation of the oncogene, with a post-treatment transient hyperphosphorylation phase that culminates into a dramatic increase in cancer cell proliferation. The molecular mechanisms behind the \u2018MET burst\u2019 after treatment cessation are unknown but critically important for patients. Here we identify a positive feedback loop mediated by the AKT/mTOR pathway leading to (a) enhanced MET translation by activating p70S6K and 4EBP1 and (b) MET hyper-phosphorylation by inactivation of the tyrosinephosphatase PTP1B. The latter effect is due to m-TOR-driven PTP1B phosphorylation of the inhibitory residues Ser50 and Ser378. These data provide in vitro evidence for the use of mTOR inhibitors to prevent the \u2019flare effect\u2019 in MET targeted therapy, with potential applicative ramifications for patient clinical management.",

Among cancers driven by tyrosine kinase receptors, those relying on alterations of the MET oncogene benefit from treatment by specific inhibitors. Previously, we reported that discontinuation of MET tyrosine kinase receptor inhibition causes \u2018rebound\u2019 activation of the oncogene, with a post-treatment transient hyperphosphorylation phase that culminates into a dramatic increase in cancer cell proliferation. The molecular mechanisms behind the \u2018MET burst\u2019 after treatment cessation are unknown but critically important for patients. Here we identify a positive feedback loop mediated by the AKT/mTOR pathway leading to (a) enhanced MET translation by activating p70S6K and 4EBP1 and (b) MET hyper-phosphorylation by inactivation of the tyrosinephosphatase PTP1B. The latter effect is due to m-TOR-driven PTP1B phosphorylation of the inhibitory residues Ser50 and Ser378. These data provide in vitro evidence for the use of mTOR inhibitors to prevent the \u2019flare effect\u2019 in MET targeted therapy, with potential applicative ramifications for patient clinical management.\nTargeted therapies were a breakthrough in cancer research, proving our ability to translate cutting-edge understanding of cancer cells\u2019 vulnerabilities into the design of mechanism-specific treatment strategies. They significantly improved the disease-free survival time of patients with tumours dependent on the inhibited target (\u2018oncogene addiction\u2019)1. MET, the receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factor, stands among the top five proteins for which targeted therapies have been developed with successful applications in the clinic2. Genetic alterations or gene amplification unleash MET-driven invasive growth in a large panel of cancer types3. Accordingly, kinase inhibitors or antibodies induced objective responses in patients with (or preclinical models of) MET-addicted tumours, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), lung squamous carcinoma, gastric cancer, colorectal adenocarcinoma, melanoma, gliomas, and renal cancer1,3\u201314. However, even in cases experiencing exceptional responses, therapeutic resistance inevitably ensues15\u201317. In current clinical practice, the line of treatment is dismissed when resistance arises. In many patients, discontinuation of kinase inhibitors results in rapid tumour regrowth: this phenomenon is known as disease \u2018flare\u2019 or tumour \u2019rebound\u201918\u201321. Its real incidence is poorly known, and the prognosis is dismal22. The biology and molecular mechanisms behind the \u2018flare\u2019 (rebound) phenomenon, either cell-autonomous or mediated by the tumour microenvironment, are largely unexplored. We previously found that abrupt termination of MET kinase inhibition unleashes the \u2018flare\u2019 effect23. In this paper, we provide the mechanistic explanation for this effect by describing a dual regulation of the MET burst: sudden discontinuation of the targeted therapy leads to restored kinase activity followed by the activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, resulting in (1) enhanced translation of MET and (2) inactivation of the PTP1B phosphotyrosine-phosphatase, one of the major negative regulators of MET24\u201326. Cancer cells adopt this shrewd dual strategy to increase MET total protein quantity and MET phosphorylation (activation), leading to a rapid resumption of cancer cell proliferation. We demonstrate that the \u2018flare effect\u2019 is avoided by specific AKT or mTOR inhibitors and thus provide a proof-of-concept foundation for strategies improving MET targeted therapy.\nOPEN\n1IFOM ETS - The AIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology, Via Adamello 16, 20139 Milano, Italy. 2Candiolo Cancer Institute, FPO-IRCCS, Strada Provinciale 142, 10060 Candiolo, TO, Italy. 3Department of Oncology, University of Torino, Strada Provinciale 142, 10060 Candiolo, TO, Italy. *email: dogus.altintas@ifom.eu; paolo.comoglio@ ifom.eu\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:1378 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-28648-3"

            "text": "Reactivation of the MET/AKT axis drives the \u2018flare\u2019 effect. Treatment of cancer cells bearing an amplified, constitutively active MET oncogene with the MET kinase inhibitor JNJ-38877605 (indicated JNJ605) blocks proliferation in\u00a0vitro and halts tumour growth in\u00a0vivo1,27\u201330. However, inhibitor withdrawal causes rapid MET re-phosphorylation at levels higher than those at the steady state, with the subsequent reactivation of downstream pathways and increased proliferation of cancer cells23. Yet, the mechanisms of this phenomenon remain obscure. To enlighten what is behind the flare effect, we used two cell lines derived from two cancer cell types (EBC1 isolated from lung squamous carcinoma and HS746T from gastric carcinoma). These cell lines were carefully chosen to recapitulate the most common alterations of MET in cancer leading to MET \u2018addiction\u2019: gene amplification (EBC1 cells) and exon14 skipping (HS746T cells)31. Overnight JNJ-605 treatment abolished MET phosphorylation (Fig.\u00a01A and B). The washout (WO) of the inhibitor from the culture medium restored MET tyrosine activity, reaching -after 48\u00a0h- levels of constitutive phosphorylation higher than those displayed by untreated cells at the steady state (i.e., the \u2018flare effect\u2019). The activation (phosphorylation) status of known MET transducers, i.e., P-AKT and P-ERK, was analysed. Remarkably, P-AKT levels were significantly enhanced after WO compared with the pre-treatment steady state, whereas no significant change was observed in P-ERK. The concomitant increase of P-MET and P-AKT after WO led us to hypothesise that the MET/AKT axis might be involved in the flare effect. Notably, the specific AKT inhibitor MK-2206 prevented MET hyperphosphorylation after WO (Fig.\u00a01C) and hampered the burst of cell growth resulting from the WO-related \u2019flare effect\u2019 (Fig.\u00a01D). Importantly, AKT inhibition prevented the reactivation (phosphorylation) of the upstream MET only after JNJ605 withdrawal, an effect not observed in JNJ-605-untreated cells (Fig.\u00a01C). These results suggest that JNJ-605 washout results in a positive feedback mechanism on MET re-phosphorylation, in which the AKT pathway acts as an intermediate regulator.\nThe mTOR pathway enhances MET protein synthesis. Interestingly, the kinetics in Fig.\u00a01A showed that the P-MET burst was observed after 48\u201372\u00a0h, a time too long to be fully explained with kinase reactivation after drug discontinuation. We noticed that after WO, total MET protein levels increased. These observations led us to verify the activation status of mTOR, the master regulator of de novo protein synthesis, and the direct target of AKT kinase32\u201334. mTOR phosphorylation levels were gradually increased after MET kinase reactivation following JNJ-605 inhibitor WO in both EBC1 and HS746T cells (Fig.\u00a02A). Accordingly, the downstream protein synthesis effectors in the mTOR pathway, p70S6K and 4EBP1, were phosphorylated (Fig.\u00a02B). Furthermore, the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) hampered post-treatment MET protein overexpression and hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that the de novo MET synthesis is critical for the \u2018flare\u2019 effect (Fig.\u00a02B).\nThe mTOR pathway enhances MET re-phosphorylation. mTOR is part of two structurally and functionally distinct complexes: mTORC1, sensitive to rapamycin, and mTORC2, insensitive to the latter but sensitive to the inhibitor JA/AB2/01135,36. mTORC1 is activated by AKT, whereas mTORC2 is directly triggered by PI3K and -in turn- activates AKT36. We thus tested the role of each complex on the \u2019flare effect\u2019 by treating cells with the corresponding specific inhibitors. Treatment of EBC1 or HS746T cells with either inhibitor after JNJ605 WO blocked the \u2019flare effect\u2019 (Fig.\u00a02B\u2013C), emphasising that both complexes mediate MET reactivation. The reactivation was also inhibited by the mTOR inhibitor Temsirolimus (Fig.\u00a02B\u2013C).\nmTOR inactivates PTP1B by phosphorylation of Ser50 and Ser378. Previously, we noticed that during the \u2018flare\u2019 effect, PTP1B levels were affected23. PTP1B is a potent tyrosine phosphatase known to inactivate MET37, and its enzymatic function is negatively modulated by phosphorylation on several serine residues (S50, S352, and S378) in response to different stimuli24,25. These pieces of evidence prompted us to investigate the possible role of PTP1B in cells released from MET kinase inhibition. EBC1 and HS746T cells were treated overnight with JNJ-605 and released through a rapid washout. Concomitant with the peak of MET tyrosine re-phosphorylation, we detected a substantial increase in PTP1B serine phosphorylation on two residues (S50 and S378) both in EBC1 and in HS746T cells. The S352 was phosphorylated to a lesser extent after MET kinase inhibitor washout (Fig.\u00a03A).\nWe thus verified if the AKT/mTOR axis was responsible for the phosphorylation/inactivation of PTP1B by using the publicly available TCGA phosphoproteome dataset (mTOR and PTP1B phosphorylation data were only available for breast cancer, N = 42 patients). We found that mTOR phosphorylation in patients was positively correlated with PTP1B phosphorylation, especially on S50 and S378 (https:// www. cancer. gov/ tcga, Fig.\u00a03B). We, therefore, assessed the phosphorylation levels of PTP1B in EBC1 and HS746T cells after JNJ-605 washout treated with indicated inhibitors. While JNJ-605 washout provoked a substantial increase of S50 and S378, AKT and mTOR inhibition hampered PTP1B phosphorylation-dependent inactivation (Fig.\u00a03C). These results indicate that, during inhibitor withdrawal, PTP1B is phosphorylated on S50 and S378 by the AKT/mTOR pathway and suggest that these post-translational modifications inhibit dephosphorylation of the MET receptor.\nWe then directly tested the effect of S50 and S378 phosphorylation on the \u2018flare\u2019 effect. We generated a panel of single mutants at residues 50, 352 or 378 by replacing serine with alanine (\u2018phosphorylation null\u2019 mutants, S50A, S352A, S378A). PTP1B wild type (wt) or mutants were transfected in EBC1 or HS746T cells. Overexpression of PTP1B-wt reduced phosphorylation of MET. S378A further decreased levels of MET phosphorylated (Fig.\u00a04A). S50A mutant showed a mild effect, whereas the S352A mutant displayed no noticeable difference compared to wt PTP1B. The double mutants behaved like single mutants, suggesting that Serine 50 or Serine 378 are critically important for the \u2018flare\u2019 effect, and their influence is not additive (data not shown). Besides, overexpression of wt or mutants PTP1B did not hamper mTOR activation, further supporting that PTP1B is downstream of mTOR. Moreover, cell proliferation was hampered when PTP1B was overexpressed (Fig.\u00a04B, wt condition).

            "text": "MET phosphorylation drives its oncogenic potential38. We confirm that increased and sustained MET phosphorylation in cancer cells released from kinase blockade enhances proliferation23. These findings point to MET reactivation after inhibitor dismissal as a relevant risk of \u2018rebound\u2019 in cancer cells. This unfortunate event has been described in the clinic for EGF receptor inhibitors as the\u2014so far unexplained\u2014\u2018flare\u2019 effect21,22. Like the EGF receptor, MET down-regulation is achieved by deeply intertwined processes, namely, dephosphorylation and endocytosis-mediated degradation39. Receptor internalisation is triggered by tyrosine auto-phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail. In a previous paper, we showed that inhibition of phosphorylation of MET goes along with inhibition of internalisation and accumulation at the surface23. Other researchers published similar observations using other small molecule inhibitors (EMD1214063, PHA665752, PF02341066)40. It should be noted that the receptor accumulated at the cell surface is not phosphorylated, and therefore inactive, but potentially ready to be re-activated after inhibitor withdrawal23,40. Here, we show that the phosphatase PTP1B is inhibited by AKT-mTOR-dependent phosphorylation upon inhibitor withdrawal. PTP1B is central to MET regulation because it dephosphorylates the activating residues Y1234/1235 on the kinase domain, inhibiting all receptor functions. PTP1B can be phosphorylated in serine, which inhibits phosphatase activity24,25,41. After MET kinase inhibitor withdrawal, PTP1B is inhibited by AKT-mTOR-dependent phosphorylation. PTP1B-dependent MET tyrosine dephosphorylation is therefore impaired, and MET is hyper-activated. In particular, we observed that\nFigure\u00a05. Schematics of the mechanism of the \u2018flare\u2019 effect. JNJ-605 discontinuation leads to the activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, which drives (1) PTP1B inactivation by phosphorylation on S50 and S378, and (2) enhances translation of MET kinase. This dual feature leads to hyper-expressed and hyper-activated MET and favours the \u2018flare\u2019 effect.

Notably, AKT and mTOR inhibition both affect phosphorylation of PTP1B and blunt reactivation of MET after JNJ-605 washout, showing that the AKT-mTOR axis is part of a MET positive feedback loop.\nThe AKT/MTOR pathway triggered by discontinuation of MET blockade is responsible for MET hyperphosphorylation and MET synthesis. Indeed, mTOR is a crucial regulator of translation32. In this article, we demonstrate that the AKT/mTOR pathway controls total MET levels. Altogether, we describe the \u2018flare\u2019 effect as the consequence of a strategy of cancer cells enhancing both MET phosphorylation (activation) and MET synthesis.\nThe critical role of mTOR in cancer is well-known32,42. This study shows its pivotal role during the \u2018flare\u2019 effect and its emergence as a promising target against tumour \u2018rebound\u2019. We demonstrate that AKT/mTOR activation follows the withdrawal of MET inhibitors, initiating a positive feedback activation of the MET pathway, responsible for the \u2018flare\u2019 effect. If these conclusions can be generalised, pulsatile treatments alternating tyrosine kinase and mTOR inhibitors could provide a promising strategy to hamper tumour growth, reducing the risk of disease \u2018rebound\u2019."

            "text": "Plasmids and mutagenesis. The pJ3H PTP1B plasmid was a kind gift from Ben Neel (Addgene plasmid number 8601). Q5\u00ae Site-Directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs\u00ae, Catalogue number E0554) was used following manufacturer\u2019s instructions to generate Serine to Alanine mutations of PTP1B. Primers used for the mutagenesis reactions are listed in Supplementary Table\u00a01. Plasmids used in this study are available upon request.\nCell culture. EBC1 (Creative Bioarray, Catalogue number CSC-C6336J) and HS746T (ATCC, Catalogue number HTB-135TM) cell lines were purchased from indicated companies and were cultured respectively in RPMI and DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% L-Glutamine. The medium was reefed every 3\u20134\u00a0days. All cells were regularly assessed for the absence of mycoplasma contamination. Cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 reagent following manufacturer\u2019s instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific\u2122, Catalogue number 1ack1668019).\nInhibitor withdrawal. EBC1 and HS746T cells were plated at the concentration of 5 \u00d7 105 cells in 6\u00a0cm dishes. Twenty-four hours later, the MET kinase inhibitor JNJ-38877605 (indicated as JNJ-605) was added at a concentration of 500\u00a0nM overnight (ON). Cells were washed three times with medium. After adding fresh medium, cells were left in culture for indicated durations. DMSO-treated cells (VEH) were processed as the JNJ605-treated ones. When indicated, inhibitors were added to the medium immediately after the JNJ-605 washout. The different inhibitors used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table\u00a02.\nImmunoblotting. Cells were lysed in Laemmli Lysis Buffer as previously described31. Cell lysates were quantified using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific\u2122, Catalogue number 23225), and 15\u00a0\u00b5g of total proteins were resolved in polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions. After transfer, membranes (ThermoFisher Scientific\u2122, Invitrolon\u2122 PVDF, Catalogue number LC2005) were blotted against antibodies listed in Supplementary Table\u00a03. Bands were revealed by chemiluminescent reaction (Merck, ECL\u2122\u00a0Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent, Catalogue number GERPN2232, and ECL\u2122\u00a0Select Western Blotting Detection Reagent, Catalogue number GERPN2235).\nImmunofluorescence. Cells were plated in chamber slides (ThermoFisher Scientifi\u2122, Nunc\u2122 Lab-Tek\u2122 II Chamber Slide\u2122 System, Catalogue number 154461PK). Immunostainings were performed as previously described using antibodies listed in Supplementary Table\u00a03. Images were acquired with the Leica TCS SP8-DLS microscope (Leica Microsystems).\nViability assay. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells / well. After the ON JNJ-605 treatment, cells were washed as described above and treated with the indicated inhibitors. Cell viability was assessed using CellTiter 96\u00ae Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Catalogue Number G4100) every day for eight days. The culture medium was renewed every three days.\nStudy cohort. The publicly available TCGA dataset was used to assess PTP1B and mTOR phosphorylation levels in human cancers. On the day of analyses (June 2022), 97.3% of TCGA phosphoproteome data was based obtained from breast invasive carcinoma patients. For some patients, PTP1B and/or mTOR phosphorylation levels were unavailable and therefore not analysed. In the end, a cohort of 42 breast carcinoma patients was obtained. Patient information is available in Supplementary Table\u00a04."
