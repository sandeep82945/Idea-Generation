    "abstractText": "Protothecosis is an important infection caused by Prototheca spp., an alga that affect humans and animals. Prototheca spp. infections determine losses of production and quality of life for the affected animals. In this disease, prevention and early diagnosis are essential to avoid the spread of the agent to susceptible hosts. This review aimed to assemble the reported cases of protothecosis in Veterinary Medicine, highlighting Prototheca species involved in the infections, the main animal species affected, as well as the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. Our findings showed that protothecosis has been reported in various domestic and wild animal species, presenting diverse clinical manifestations, including mastitis in cows, respiratory manifestations in goats and cats, and a wide range of clinical signs in dogs. The clinical diagnosis and treatment of Prototheca spp. infections are difficult and infected animals are frequently discarded or euthanized. Due to the importance of this infection, protothecosis must be considered an important differential diagnosis in routine clinical Veterinary Medicine. Significance and impact of the study Protothecosis is an important infection caused by algae that affect humans and animals, causing great damage to animal production systems, as well as to the quality of life of affected animals. In this disease, prevention and early diagnosis are essential to avoid the spread of the agent, since there is no effective treatment protocol for the cure of affected animals. Thus, this work seeks to inform about the main clinical manifestations of protothecosis, demonstrating the importance of investigating this agent in the clinical routine of Veterinary Medicine.",

            "text": "Since its discovery in 1894 by Kr\u00fcger, the taxonomic classification of Prototheca spp. has been discussed, and in recent decades, based on molecular analyses, these microorganisms have been classified as algae closely related to the microorganism Chlorella spp. (Irrgang et al. 2015). When it was initially described, the Prototheca genus was not listed as a cause of illness. In 1952, Lerche performed the first description of protothecosis in bovine mastitis, and subsequently in 1964, Davies reported the first human infection caused by Prototheca spp. (Todd et al. 2018). Since then, numerous reports of infections caused by Prototheca spp. have been found in the literature, a summary is listed in Table 1.\nPrototheca spp. are unicellular algae achlorophylls. These algae freely occurring in nature and reproduce asexually by endosporulation (Sudman and Kaplan 1973). These eukaryotic organisms are organized in an oval or spherical cell called the mother cell (sporangium), which can produce 2\u201316 daughter cells, known as endospores (Camboim et al. 2010b). Prototheca spp. have a wide environmental spread and prefer moist places with the presence of organic matter (Pore et al. 1983). They are isolated from feces, sea and lake waters, trees, and several other biomes, facilitating the exposure of suscep-\ntible hosts to the pathogen in different environments (Sudman and Kaplan 1973).\nSince the first reports of the occurrence of these microorganisms, many changes have been made regarding their classifications. A total of seven species of Prototheca had been recognized, including P. stagnora, P. ulmea, P. wickerhamii, P. blaschkeae, P. zopfii, P. cutis, and P. miyajii (Pore et al. 1983, Roesler et al. 2006, Satoh et al. 2010); P. moriformis was not considered a distinct species because it was genetically and biochemically similar to P. zopfii and with great heterogeneity between strains (Roesler et al. 2006, Severgnini et al. 2018). Jagielski et al. (2019a) proposed a new classification for the genus based on the evaluation of the mitochondrial cytochrome B (cytB) gene by including six new species, totaling 14 species. Thus, the genus was grouped into two main lineages: the triad formed by P. ciferrii sp. nov, P. zopfii, P. bovis sp. nov, and P. wickerhamii cluster. Nevertheless, three new species (i.e. P. cookei sp. nov., P. cerasi sp. nov., and P. pringsheimii sp. nov.) were related to the aforementioned triad but with important differences. Furthermore, P. wickerhamii, P. cutis, P. miyajii, and the newly proposed species P. xanthoriae sp. nov. have been reported as the closest related species to the photosynthetic genera Chlorella and Auxenochlorella. According to the taxonomy proposed by Jagielski et al. (2019a),\nReceived: July 4, 2022. Revised: March 3, 2023. Accepted: May 20, 2023 C\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.

Although protothecosis is still considered uncommon, many cases have been diagnosed and reported around the world in the last decade (Todd et al. 2012, Masuda et al. 2016, Khan et al. 2018, Jagielski et al. 2019, Sim et al. 2019); the existing data in the literature referring to infections caused by each of the species of Prototheca pathogenic algae to animals are listed in Table 1.\nAmong the species recognized prior to the use of cytB gene, P. stagnora and P. ulmea were not considered pathogenic to animals and humans (Cremonesi et al. 2012). Despite P. zopfii genotype 1 not being considered pathogenic by some authors, some studies have reported detecting its presence in animals infections (Silveira et al. 2018).\nP. wickerhamii, P. cutis, P. miyajii, and P. blaschkeae have been associated as causative agents of disease in humans, especially in people with a compromised immune system (LassFl\u00f6rl and Mayr 2007, Satoh et al. 2010, Masuda et al. 2016); the main clinical presentation in humans is cutaneous protothecosis (Carneiro et al. 2007, Satoh et al. 2010).\nPrototheca zopfii demonstrated high resistance to high temperatures, representing a risk for milk and dairy product consumption both in natura and after dairy processing, characterizing this agent as a potential risk to public health (Melville et al. 1999). Lassa et al. (2011) demonstrated that P. zopfii could survive even after the conventionally employed time/temperature combination of 15 s of heating at 72\u25e6C in a short-term high-temperature pasteurization method.\nTreatment is difficult as the vast majority of antibacterial and antimycotic drugs commonly used in Veterinary Medicine\nhave variable effects on infections caused by Prototheca spp. The resistance presented by these algae to commercially available drugs is associated with their ability to infect and survive in macrophages and invade mammary tissues, causing a persistent infection and characteristics related to the cell wall and the production of exoenzymes by Prototheca spp. (Marques et al. 2006)."

            "text": "The dairy chain involves several aspects that must be considered, such as the genetics of the animals, nutrition, and the animal health and hygiene management established on the property, especially concerning the quality of the milk, the production obtained, and mastitis control. Mastitis is considered the most harmful disease for dairy farming worldwide, given its high occurrence in herds, production losses, and treatment costs (Zaragoza et al. 2011). Different pathogens are involved in bovine mastitis, including the algae P. zopfii genotype 2 (P. bovis) and P. blaschkeae, which stand out among the environmental agents of bovine mastitis (Bueno et al. 2006). In mastitis by Prototheca sp., economic losses are directly related to reduced animal production and milk quality and the premature disposal of animals (Jagielski et al. 2019b).\nThe experimental infection of bovine mammary cells with P. zopfii genotypes 1 and 2 has demonstrated variations in their ability to alter the viability of bovine mammary epithelial cells after infection (Shahid et al. 2017), as well as in experimental intramammary infection in mice apoptosis (Shahid et al. 2020). Therefore, P. zopfii genotype 1 showed no changes in cell viability, while genotype 2 showed reduced viability of bovine mammary epithelial cells. These results may explain why P. zopfii genotype 2 is strongly related to bovine mastitis, while P. zopfii genotype 1 is related to rare cases of infections in animals and is also considered to be low pathogenic (Shahid et al. 2017). The pathomorphological alteration caused by P. zopfii genotype 2 highlighted this genotype as a mastitis pathogen capable of penetrating mammary epithelial cells to induce inflammation and cell death, via mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (Shahid et al. 2020).\nBased on clinical characteristics, mastitis caused by algae of Prototheca genus cannot be clinically differentiated from bacterial mammary gland infections (J\u00e1nosi et al. 2001a). Mastitis caused by Prototheca spp. can be subclinical or clinical, slowly progressive, making early diagnosis difficult. Nevertheless, bovine mastitis is predominantly chronic with granulomatous lesions, usually without other systemic signs. The infection is characterized by the accentuated proliferation of the interstitial connective tissue and concomitant atrophy of the alveoli in chronic cases (J\u00e1nosi et al. 2001a, Cremonesi et al. 2012), ranging from mild changes in the milk, increased somatic cells, reduced milk production, and the milk may even present an appearance of watery secretion containing white flakes (Cremonesi et al. 2012). In chronic cases, there are still circumscribed foci of necrosis, fibroblastic proliferation, alveolar atrophy, infiltration of mononuclear cells, and formation of microgranulomas associated with the proliferative process (Corbellini et al. 2001, J\u00e1nosi et al. 2001b). The persistence of algae of the genus Prototheca in milking environments can be considered a risk factor for the transmission of the pathogen\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /lam bio/article/76/6/ovad066/7191846 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nin this environment, characterizing a serious health problem for the dairy system (J\u00e1nosi et al. 2001a).\nCase reports of bovine mastitis caused by Prototheca spp. has increased worldwide, with a higher occurrence in herds maintained in confined systems and areas with high temperature and humidity that provide adequate conditions for the multiplication of this pathogen (Costa et al. 1996, J\u00e1nosi et al. 2001a). Scaccabarozzi et al. (2008) suggested that contaminated milking devices might favor the transfer of the microorganism between infected and uninfected cows. Feeding calves with milk obtained from cows with intramammary infections can contribute to new infections. J\u00e1nosi et al. 2001b reported that calves fed milk from cows with mastitis caused by Prototheca spp. can spread the agent through fecal elimination, increasing environmental contamination.\nAccording to Libisch et al. (2022), Prototheca spp. have been isolated from a wide range of environmental and other sources, such as drinking water, raw milk, vegetables, raw meat, animal feed, gastrointestinal and fecal samples from animals, and sewage. However, the actual source of protothecal infections remained uncertain. Additionally, the authors suggested the molecular genotyping of Prototheca spp. isolates cultured from the environment and compared with those causing the infection would be necessary in upcoming studies.\nUnfortunately, there is no effective cure for the affected animals due to the inherent resistance of these microalgae to different groups of antimicrobial drugs. As stated by Piper et al. (2012), the use of antimicrobial treatments that inhibit the natural competitive flora of the udder may be related to the increase in cases of protothecosis in dairy cows, especially in properties with high rates of environmental contamination by algae. Thus, the main actions recommended in the control and prophylaxis of the bovine protothecosis include early diagnosis, good milking practices, and chemical drying of affected quarters or even the disposal of affected animals (Corbellini et al. 2001, Capra et al. 2014)."

            "text": "Protothecosis is reported sporadically in small ruminants. In goats, infections caused by Prototheca spp. are mainly associated with lesions in the nose and should be remembered in the differential diagnosis of the causes of rhinitis (Riet-Correa et al. 2021). Until this moment, there are no reports of sheep protothecosis; in this species, the algal infections are related to Chlorella genus (Riet-Correa et al. 2021).\nPrototheca wickerhamii infections have been reported in goats in northeastern Brazil, where the animals presented labored and noisy breathing, mucopurulent nasal discharge, reduced airflow, sneezing, and proliferative nodules (Macedo et al. 2008, Camboim et al. 2010a). Pathological characteristics included necrotizing lesions of the nasal vestibule, nostrils, and subcutaneous and cutaneous tissues of the face and head (Macedo et al. 2008, Camboim et al. 2010a, b, Riet-Correa et al. 2021). Additionally, this infection has been reported in cases of long-progressing infections, and it is possible to find deeper nodules infiltrated in the mucosa and nasal bone; skin lesions have also been characterized as necrotizing pyogranulomatous dermatitis, rhinitis, and osteomyelitis with the presence of sporangia (Camboim et al. 2010a).\nConsidering the anatomical localization of these lesions in goat protothecosis, there is a strong indication that contamination occurs by contact of the nostril mucosa or skin with\nwater contaminated by P. wickerhamii (Macedo et al. 2008, Camboim et al. 2010a). Despite the prolonged course of the disease, there are no cases of systemic dissemination of the infection in goats, as reported in other animal species (Macedo et al. 2008, Camboim et al. 2010a). However, recently, our group demonstrated that it is possible to reproduce experimentally intramammary infection in goats by P. bovis (Ely et al. 2023).\nPrototheca infection in equines In horses, P. zopfii genotype 2 infections have been reported in association with other microorganisms (namely Pithomyces chartarum and Streptococcus equi zooepidemicus). The clinical manifestations are related to the upper respiratory tract, with purulent nasal discharge for several weeks and the presence of epistaxis, in addition to swelling of the nasal mucosa that causes a partial obstruction of the nasal meatus. In endoscopic examination was verified the presence of focal necrotizing inflammation of the maxillary sinus. In the histopathological examination was observed an accentuated pyogranulomatous rhinitis, with infiltration of defense cells and a large number of algae in the region of the lesion. In the case of infection by Prototheca spp. in association with the fungus, treatment was performed with mechanical curettage, washing with povidone\u2013iodine and hydrogen peroxide solution, and administration of griseofulvin for 2 weeks. After treatment, the animal showed total regression of symptoms. In the horse infected by Prototheca spp.-associated bacterial infection, no treatment was reported and the animal continued to present nasal secretion 1 year after the initial detection of clinical signs. In both horses, lesions were present only in the upper respiratory tract, thus the infection likely occurred via inhalation (Sch\u00f6niger et al. 2016).\nPrototheca infections in fish In fish, there is a report of protothecosis in carp (Cyprinus carpio) caused by P. wickerhamii from a carp farm. The animal presented low weight proportional to its age and erratic and slow swimming behavior. In addition, multiple lesions were evidenced, including erosions, ulcers, and nodular ulcers spread over the entire surface of the animal; these lesions were especially visible in the gills, liver, and intestinal mucosa (Jagielski et al. 2017)."

            "text": "Protothecosis in small animals, here considered as conventional pets (dogs and cats), has an insidious onset, presenting a wide range of diagnostic possibilities, consequently making clinical diagnosis difficult (Falcaro et al. 2021). In dogs, the protothecosis is caused by P. bovis, P. ciferrii, and P. wickerhamii (Falcaro et al. 2021). The clinical presentation occurs in the disseminated form and is less frequent in the localized form. Many cases of canine protothecosis initially present as refractory colitis, demonstrating that the food route seems to be the main entry point for infectious propagules. The progression of the infection to other systems tends to be slow, with the only signs being related to the digestive system, remaining for long periods and later evolving to ocular and/or neurological alterations (Stenner et al. 2007, Falcaro et al. 2021). Interestingly, reports of infections caused by P. wickerhamii have been mainly related to the occurrence of cutaneous\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /lam bio/article/76/6/ovad066/7191846 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nprotothecosis. However, infections by P. bovis and P. ciferri have been reported as more invasive, with greater dissemination and tissue involvement (Falcaro et al. 2021).\nProtothecosis has a severe prognosis in canine patients (Vince et al. 2014), and treatment prognosis may be related to the infected tissues and organs, the disease progression, and the early detection of the infection. Unfortunately, Prototheca spp. is often not considered a differential diagnosis until the microorganism is found in the lesions (Vince et al. 2014). Moreover, it is crucial to perform a biopsy to a cytological and/or histological evaluation to detect Prototheca spp. cells in the tissues (Falcaro et al. 2021).\nSurgical resection associated with antimicrobial therapy is not routinely used in veterinary patients, limiting to cases in which the infection appears to be located (Vince et al. 2014). Recently, Gmyterco et al. (2023) demonstrated the effectiveness of using oral itraconazole in pulse dosage for long-term control of P. wickerhamii infection in a dog with skin lesions. In most cases of canine protothecosis, the animals die due to disease progression or euthanasia is performed (Stenner et al. 2007).\nIn cats, P. wikerhamii and P. cutis have been listed as the species involved in infections, especially cutaneous nodules and respiratory syndromes, and in most reported cases, there is the occurrence of a single and localized lesion. Regarding multifocal lesions by P. wickerhamii in cats, Masuda et al. (2021) reported that the lesions were peripheral and distal, although without evidence of systemic invasion. In P. cutis infection, respiratory signs such as sneezing and coughing in an adult immunocompetent cat were reported, and the animal was unresponsive to treatment with steroids and thirdgeneration cephalosporins. In this case, the animal was euthanized before the final diagnosis due to the initial suspicion of another infectious disease with potential risk of zoonosis (Maboni et al. 2021). Unlike dogs, in cats, there are no records of digestive system infections."

In Tamandua tetradactyla, known as collared anteater or lesser anteater, disseminated erythematous and ulcerative skin lesions have already been reported, and the infections were detected in the muzzle, ears, tail, pelvic and thoracic limbs, as well as digit regions (Avelar et al. 2013). In this case, the diagnosis of protothecosis was performed by histopathology. Despite the treatment of T. tetradactyla, there was no remission of the infection, and the animal died after a long period of treatment with oral itraconazole (Avelar et al. 2013).\nTherapeutic methods employed in protothecosis In Veterinary Medicine, there is no established treatment protocol for protothecosis. In bovine mastitis caused by Prototheca spp., therapeutical treatment is not recommended due to the possibility of disseminating the agent in the herd. Nevertheless, chemically drying the affected mammary gland can be performed or even the disposal of the infected animal (Corbellini et al. 2001).\nIn other animal species affected by Prototheca spp., recommendations may vary according to the infection\u2019s presentation, location, and extent. It is important to emphasize that\nconcerning protothecosis, the greatest chance of cure depends on early diagnosis, with a better prognosis in localized infections than in cases of disseminated disease or involving regions of lesser action of antimicrobials, such as the eyes and brain (Masuda et al. 2021).\nSeveral substances with antimicrobial activity have been researched as potential anti-Prototheca spp. drugs, including antifungal and antibacterial substances (nystatin, gentamicin, and amphotericin B) routinely used in infections caused by these microorganisms (Jagielski et al. 2012, Chang et al. 2013, Grzesiak et al. 2016, Alves et al. 2017). In addition, in vitro studies evaluating the potential of natural extracts (grapefruit, cinnamon, clove, marjoram, thyme, and oregano essential oils) (Grzesiak et al. 2016, 2018, Nardoni et al. 2018), silver nanoparticles (Jagielski et al. 2018a, Ely et al. 2022), 3-bromopyruvate (Jagielski et al. 2018b), and highly soluble polypyrrole (Ely et al. 2020) have been reported in recent years. Currently, Gmyterco et al. (2023) demonstrated that using oral itraconazole in pulse dosing healed a dog with cutaneous protothecosis. In addition, Ely et al. (2023) verified that polypyrrole reduced the counts of P.bovis in experimental mastitis in goats, showing potential to inhibit this microorganism also in vivo, and demonstrating its ability for the treatment of protothecosis."

            "text": "This minireview shows that in the last decade, the main species of Prototheca involved in animal infections included: P. blaschkeae (bovine), P. cutis (cat), P. wickerhamii (goat and fish), and P. zopfii genotype 1 (dog) and genotype 2 (bovine, cat, dog, and equine). In different susceptible hosts, it is reported clinical manifestations diverse, including mastitis in cows, respiratory manifestations in goats, equine and cats, skin lesions in fish, and a wide range of clinical unspecific signs in dogs, mainly involving nervous or enteric systems. We believe that unspecific clinical signs in the different animal species affected makes the diagnosis of protothecosis difficult during routine diagnostic tests. This fact may be responsible for the low number of reports about protothecosis infections in Veterinary Medicine found in the scientific literature. Several substances with antimicrobial activity have been used in Prototheca spp. infections. However, there is no standard protocol for the treatment of protothecosis that promotes the cure of affected animals, and frequently, these animals are discarded or euthanized. Thus, protothecosis is a relevant infection in animals, and professionals must be alert to the presence of these nonspecific clinical signs, as well as consider this disease in the differential diagnosis in the clinical routine of Veterinary Medicine."
