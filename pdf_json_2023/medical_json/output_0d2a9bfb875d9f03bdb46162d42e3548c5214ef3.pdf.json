    "abstractText": "Purpose To compare the sensitivity and discriminant validity of generic and cancer-specific measures for assessing healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) for individuals undergoing diagnostic or surveillance colonoscopy for colorectal cancer. Methods HRQoL was assessed using EQ-5D-5L (generic), and EORTC QLQ-C30 (cancer-specific) scales, 14 days after (baseline) and one-year following colonoscopy (follow-up). Utility scores were calculated by mapping EORTC-QLQ-C30 onto QLU-C10D. Differences between participants with different indications for colonoscopy (positive faecal occult blood test (FOBT), surveillance, or symptoms) and colonoscopy findings (no polyps, polyps, or cancer) were tested using WilcoxonMann\u2013Whitney and Kruskal\u2013Wallis H tests. Sensitivity was assessed by calculating the ceiling effects (proportion reporting the best possible level). Results 246 adults completed the survey, including those undergoing colonoscopy for symptoms (n = 87), positive FOBT (n = 92) or surveillance (n = 67). Those with symptoms had the lowest HRQoL at both baseline and follow-up, with differences observed within the HRQoL domains/areas of role function, appetite loss and bowel function on the QLU-C10D. No differences were found in HRQoL when stratified by findings at colonoscopy with both measures or when comparing baseline and follow-up responses. Participants reporting full health with EQ-5D-5L (21% at baseline and 16% at follow-up) still had problems on the QLU-C10D, with fatigue and sleep at baseline and with role function and fatigue at follow-up. Conclusion Patients undergoing colonoscopy for symptoms had lower HRQoL compared to surveillance or positive FOBT. The cancer-specific QLU-C10D was more sensitive and had greater discriminant ability between patients undergoing colonoscopy for different indications.",

            "text": "Colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer and is responsible for 11% of cancer deaths in Australia [1], and other developed countries [2, 3]. Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a five-year survival of around 70% which is mainly attributable to finding cancer in its early stages [4, 5]. This is achieved with screening programs, such as with colonoscopy, or through utilising faecal occult blood tests (FOBT) followed by diagnostic colonoscopy for those returning a positive screening test result [6\u20138]. In addition, regular surveillance colonoscopy for individuals deemed at elevated risk (those with a previous neoplastic lesion or a significant family history of colorectal cancer) reduces the incidence of and mortality of CRC [9, 10]. People at elevated risk for CRC are generally recommended to undergo colonoscopy * Norma B. Bulamu norma.bulamu@flinders.edu.au 1 Flinders Health and\u00a0Medical Research Institute, College of\u00a0Medicine and\u00a0Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, South\u00a0Australia, Australia 2 Monash Business School, Centre for\u00a0Health Economics, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia 3 School of\u00a0Health and\u00a0Related Research (ScHARR), The University of\u00a0Sheffield, Sheffield, UK 4 Gastroenterology Department, Flinders Medical Centre, Adelaide, South\u00a0Australia, Australia\n1 3\nevery three to five years [11]. With the increasing number of colonoscopy procedures worldwide, attention must be paid to the delivery of care, which can be informed by the assessment of patient-reported outcomes.\nScreening and surveillance colonoscopy reduces mortality and the incidence of CRC through adenoma removal [12\u201314]; however, the colonoscopy procedure is associated with discomfort, pain and a risk of adverse events such as perforation [15]. It is also argued that knowing one\u2019s results after a colonoscopy may be associated with a certain degree of anxiety depending on the nature of the results [16\u201318]. As such, both the procedure and diagnostic results may have an impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Several of these studies reporting the impact of CRC screening on patient-reported outcomes such as HRQoL have applied generic measures such as the SF-36 [18], or non-validated scales specifically designed for the studies [16]. Studies assessing HRQoL following a diagnosis of cancer show that generic measures may not be sensitive to changes in HRQoL outcomes in these populations [19\u201321]. Yet while the number of cancer-specific measures and studies applying these tools/measures in individuals with cancer has increased [22, 23], there is a paucity of research investigating their use to assess changes in HRQoL in people undergoing diagnostic (following a positive FOBT or symptoms) and surveillance colonoscopy for CRC, as well as limited studies comparing them to generic measures.\nThis study, therefore, assessed HRQoL for individuals undergoing diagnostic or surveillance colonoscopy for CRC, using both generic and cancer-specific measures. The aim was to assess the sensitivity and discriminant validity of two multi-attribute utility measures (MAUI), the generic EQ5D-5L and cancer-specific EORTC Quality of Life Utility Measure-Core 10 dimensions (QLU-C10D) for individuals undergoing colonoscopy for different indications related to CRC detection. Multi-attribute utility measures are used to assess the quality of life and generate utility estimates for the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), the outcome measure required for cost-utility analysis (CUA). With the increasing use of CUA in the assessment of health interventions, it is important to determine the appropriate instrument/scale for a given population to inform the accuracy of utility and cost-effectiveness results."

Individuals were excluded if they had prior treatment for CRC or had a pre-existing and ongoing bowel condition that required medication or was the indication for the colonoscopy (such as inflammatory bowel disease).\nThe survey was mailed out approximately 14 days after the colonoscopy. This included study information, a consent form and the HRQoL scales, first the generic EQ-5D-5L followed by the cancer-specific scale. For participants who responded to the first survey, a repeat survey was sent one year later. A reminder phone call was made if the survey had not been completed and returned within two weeks."

Colonoscopy findings were reviewed, and diagnosis was classified based on whether any type of polyp was removed, or whether colorectal cancer was diagnosed (divided into early stage (I and II) and advanced stage (III and IV)). Polyps were not divided into subclasses (e.g., advanced or non-advanced adenomas, sessile-serrated lesions, benign polyps) as it was felt that this level of discrimination would not be appropriate for most individuals. Patients\u2019 pathology knowledge is often limited to whether anything was found and removed at colonoscopy, and whether it was cancer [24, 25]."

The use of a cancer-specific scale was considered appropriate in this population (both diagnostic and surveillance colonoscopies) as studies have shown that these individuals can be fearful of a cancer diagnosis [28\u201330].\nThe generic EQ-5D-5L has five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/ depression with responses across five levels; no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems [26]. As recommended by the UK National Institute of Care Excellence (NICE) utility scores\n1 3\nfor EQ-5D-5L were generated using the EQ-5D-5L crosswalk tariff developed from a general population sample in the UK [31].\nThe cancer-specific EORTC-QLQ-C30 has one global HRQoL scale, five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea or vomiting, pain) and six single items (sleeping disorders, appetite loss, dyspnoea, diarrhoea, constipation and financial problems). Each item has four alternative responses (1\u2014not at all; 2\u2014a little; 3\u2014quite a bit; 4\u2014very much) [27]. The responses were mapped onto the QLU-C10D, a utility scoring algorithm developed by King et\u00a0al. to generate utility scores [32]. The QLU-C10D has four functional scales and six symptom scales, each with four levels: not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much. The functional scales are physical function, role function, social function and emotional functioning while the symptom scales are pain, fatigue, sleep, appetite, nausea and bowel problems. The value set for the QLU-C10D was based on an Australian general population sample with theoretical utility scores ranging from -0.095 to 1 [33]."

Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test and the Kruskal\u2013Wallis H test for non-normally distributed data were used to test for differences between subgroups. Differences between subgroups were also explored at the dimension level for both EQ-5D-5L and QLU-C10D.\nThe discriminant abilities of both EQ-5D-5L and QLUC10D were further explored using Tobit regression models, with adjustment for potential confounders of HRQoL to reduce bias [37]. Confounders considered included age, gender, marital status, having a disability and comorbidities which are known to affect health-related quality of life [38\u201340]. In addition, employment, having private health insurance and education level as proxies for socioeconomic status [41] and previous history of cancer, history of surgery as well the indication for colonoscopy were considered as proxies for baseline health status [40]. Univariate analysis using spearman correlation was undertaken, and only variables with a significant correlation to HRQoL were included in the final regression model.\nTobit regression was applied because the HRQoL data were skewed with over 20% of respondents reporting full health at both baseline and follow-up for EQ-5D-5L and 10% for QLU-C10D. The best-fitting model was determined based on the log-likelihood, and a p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

            "text": "This research aimed to assess HRQoL for individuals undergoing diagnostic or surveillance colonoscopy for CRC, using both the generic EQ-5D-5L and cancer-specific QLU-C10D and evaluate whether HRQoL differed based on the scale used. This study showed no differences in HRQoL between baseline and follow-up, using either scale, in patients undergoing screening, surveillance or symptom-driven colonoscopies, except at the dimension level. There is a paucity of studies assessing HRQoL in patients undergoing colonoscopy, however, we hypothesised that there would be differences based on colonoscopy findings. This study showed no differences in colonoscopy findings/outcomes, including for patients diagnosed with cancer with both EQ-5D-5L and QLU-C10D. This suggests a single scale of quality of life, would be sufficient to measure HRQoL in post-colonoscopy cohorts during future studies. However, it is also possible that the expected change was not detected due to the small sample size, resulting from premature study termination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, given QLU-C10D is a new instrument, there is no prior information on the expected change in scores in our target patient population.\nSymptomatic patients had a lower overall HRQoL, compared to patients undergoing colonoscopy for screening or\n1 3\nsurveillance purposes. Using QLU-C10D, after controlling for potential confounders, gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with lower HRQoL, compared to surveillance or positive FOBT. At the dimension level, more symptomatic individuals reported lower HRQoL at baseline (both measures) and at follow-up except for anxiety/depression where more under surveillance reported lower levels. The lower HRQoL reports, at both baseline and follow-up, in the group presenting with symptoms can be attributed to more patients being diagnosed with cancer in this group compared to those undergoing a surveillance colonoscopy or following a positive FOBT. However, the difference in colonoscopy findings (no polyps, polyps or cancer) between groups was not statistically significant. Also, the multivariate analysis controlled for colonoscopy findings as a confounder yet the HRQoL difference was still observed (see Table\u00a01 and Table\u00a0S3).\nOur study is different from previous studies assessing HRQoL before and after colonoscopy [18, 43] because the respondents knew their colonoscopy results before the baseline assessment. Our results showed no association between colonoscopy findings and overall HRQoL. When assessing HRQoL (SF-36) and psychological distress among participants referred for colonoscopy following a positive FOBT, Vermeer et\u00a0al. showed an increase in psychological dysfunction and worry following a cancer finding (2 weeks after colonoscopy) and a decline for those with no cancer. For those with a cancer diagnosis, psychological dysfunction declined to pre-colonoscopy measurements after 6 months [44]. Considering that participants in our study, unlike the above study, knew their colonoscopy findings at baseline (38 days after colonoscopy), this was not a true reflection of their baseline. This means that the change happened before the HRQoL assessment, and the baseline value reflected the post-colonoscopy HRQoL, which suggests that participants are returning to their true baseline level earlier than 6 months. More individuals undergoing surveillance colonoscopy reported problems with anxiety or depression (EQ5D-5L) at baseline compared to those due to symptoms or positive FOBT, but this was not observed with emotional functioning on the QLU-C10D or after controlling for potential confounders. These results with the EQ-5D-5L agree with studies that suggest that individuals taking part in routine screening/surveillance report higher levels of anxiety over the possibility of cancer [45, 46]. Yet the lack of difference in emotional functioning observed with QLU-C10D is also supported by several studies that argue that participation in colorectal cancer screening [16] or the results of a colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy have no effects on participants' psychological well-being [17, 47].\nAfter controlling for potential confounders, participants undergoing colonoscopy because of symptoms had lower HRQoL/utility scores with QLU-C10D at both baseline and one year compared to those having surveillance colonoscopy\nor because of a positive FOBT (and only at baseline with EQ-5D-5L). At the dimension level, more individuals presenting with symptoms reported lower levels for usual activities and pain/discomfort on the EQ-5D-5L at baseline. Using QLU-C10D, participants with symptoms reported lower levels for role function, appetite and bowel problems at both baseline and follow-up. This finding, particularly appetite and bowel problems is not surprising because these are common presenting signs in people undergoing colonoscopy in general [48] and under investigation for colorectal cancer [49]. It is particularly important to note that this difference is observed with the cancer-specific scale, QLUC10D, whose dimensions include disease-related symptom dimensions, unlike the generic scale.\nWe, therefore, explored whether the scales used were suitable and sensitive to HRQoL changes in this population. Participants reporting full health with EQ-5D-5L (the best level on all dimensions) still had problems according to QLU-C10D, particularly with fatigue, sleep and role function. This suggests that QLU-C10D is more sensitive than the generic scale in picking up differences in HRQoL and could potentially be used in all future studies of postcolonoscopy HRQoL, including in non-cancer cohorts. This result was similar to that observed when EQ-5D-5L was compared to the cancer-specific HRQoL scale FACT-8D [50] and when the three-level version of EQ-5D, EQ-5D-3L was compared to the cancer-specific EORTC-8D, which like QLU-C10D, is derived from the EORTC QLQ-C30 [19]. Both studies showed that compared to the cancer-specific scales, the generic scales failed to detect impairments with fatigue and sleep disturbances. These findings highlight the gap within the EQ-5D descriptive system, supporting the argument by Chen and Olsen, and Sprouk et\u00a0al., 2021 to add sleep and fatigue bolt-on dimensions to the EQ-5D descriptive system [51, 52].\nSimilar to other studies [19, 21], our results suggest that when assessing short-term HRQoL outcomes in populations undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy for cancer, the cancerspecific scale is more sensitive compared to generic scales of HRQoL. The sensitivity of a scale is critical when assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions in a particular population. A more sensitive scale will detect change where change would otherwise not have been detected with a less sensitive scale and this influences the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) results, and subsequently, the cost-effectiveness decision. While decision-making bodies (e.g. NICE, PBAC and MSAC) require the use of generic scales for purposes of economic evaluations [53\u201355], we propose that economic evaluations assessing HRQoL in this setting should consider both the generic scale\u00a0and the cancer-specific scale as it is more sensitive to differences.\nLimitations of this study include the low response rate (38%), which although similar to other quality-of-life postal\n1 3\nsurveys [56], can be attributed to the premature termination of the study data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019/2020. We also observed that more participants undergoing colonoscopy due to symptoms and those diagnosed with cancer did not respond to the survey, which indicates a response bias. There are known differences based on diagnosis after colonoscopy and that was hypothesised in this study; however, the study did not have the power to detect the expected change due to the small sample size, resulting from premature study termination. Furthermore, given QLU-C10D is a new instrument, there is no prior information on the\u00a0expected change in scores in our target patient population. We therefore recommend a larger future study with both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Future research should assess anxiety levels and cancer concerns in symptomatic patient cohorts, to assess whether these concerns persist despite a colonoscopy ruling out cancer, and if so, how such concerns can be better allayed. Also, our baseline survey was conducted after participants had received their colonoscopy results. As such we cannot provide a direct comparison to previous studies whose baseline assessments were before the colonoscopy procedure. Another possible limitation is that the EQ-5D-5L utility scores were generated based on a UK population value set as recommended by NICE [31], while the QLU-C10D was valued based on an Australian population. Another possible limitation is the ordering effect as the survey maintained the generic EQ-5D-5L before the EORTC-QLQ-C30 at both baseline and follow-up. However, studies have shown that presentation order only has a marginal effect on the patient responses to HRQoL scales [57, 58]."
