We developed the Effectiveness of Guidelines for Dissemination and Education in Psychiatric Treatment (EGUIDE) project as a dissemination and education programme for psychiatrists.\nAims The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the EGUIDE project on the subjective clinical behaviour of psychiatrists in accordance with clinical practice guidelines before and 1 and 2 years after participation in the programmes.\nMethod A total of 607 psychiatrists participated in this study during October 2016 and March 2019. They attended both 1-day educational programmes based on the clinical practice guidelines for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, and answered web questionnaires about their clinical behaviours before and 1 and 2 years after attending the programmes. We evaluated the changes in clinical behaviours in accordance with the clinical practice guidelines between before and 2 years after the programme."

Various guidelines for the clinical practice of psychiatric disorders have been published,1\u20138 and in many countries, psychiatrists commonly make clinical decisions based on clinical practice guidelines. In Japan, clinical practice guidelines for psychiatric disorders were only published 9 years ago, and Japanese psychiatrists usually make clinical decisions based on their own experience or knowledge and not based on clinical practice guidelines. As a result, pharmacotherapy for psychiatric disorders in Japan has been different from that recommended in clinical practice guidelines in other countries.9\u201314 To change this situation, the Japanese Society of Neuropsychopharmacology published the \u2018Guideline for Pharmacological Therapy of Schizophrenia\u2019 (clinical practice guideline for schizophrenia) in 2015,15 and the Japanese Society of Mood Disorders published the \u2018Treatment Guideline: Major Depressive Disorder\u2019 in 2012,16 which was revised to the \u2018Treatment Guideline II: Major Depressive Disorder\u2019 (clinical practice guideline for major depressive disorder) in 2016.17 Dissemination of clinical practice guidelines in Japan Although the clinical practice guidelines of schizophrenia andmajor depressive disorder have been published, pharmacotherapy for these disorders has not undergone sufficient transformation in\nBJPsych Open (2022) 8, e83, 1\u20137. doi: 10.1192/bjo.2022.44\n1 https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.44 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nJapan.9,10 For example, our project previously showed that for patients with schizophrenia, 57.1% were prescribed antipsychotic monotherapy, 15.5% were prescribed antipsychotic monotherapy without any other psychotropics and 31.7% received no prescription of anxiolytics or hypnotics. In addition, at 84 institutions before doctors participated in the educational programmes, 58.6% of patients with depression undergoing in-patient treatment were prescribed antidepressant monotherapy and 25.1% received no prescription of anxiolytics or hypnotics.18,19 To improve these statistics, dissemination of and education on the guidelines for Japanese psychiatrists was needed. Thus, we launched the Effectiveness of Guidelines for Dissemination and Education in Psychiatric Treatment (EGUIDE) project in 2016. The purpose of the EGUIDE project is to disseminate the guidelines by conducting educational programmes on the clinical practice guidelines for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder for psychiatrists, and to standardise medical practices in accordance with the clinical practice guidelines. We have already reported on the educational method and the effectiveness of the EGUIDE project in improving knowledge of the clinical practice guidelines in psychiatrists.20 Additionally, the effectiveness of the educational programmes was investigated by evaluating psychiatrists\u2019 clinical behaviours in accordance with the clinical practice guidelines.\nThe aim of this research is to assess the efficacy of the EGUIDE project in changing clinical behaviours in accordance with the clinical practice guidelines in psychiatrists before and 1 and 2 years after they attend the programmes."

The procedures were carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. The study protocol was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network registry (identifier UMIN000022645). The participants attended a 1-day educational programme on schizophrenia and depression based on the clinical practice guideline for schizophrenia (published by the Japanese Society of Neuropsychopharmacology) and the clinical practice guideline for major depressive disorder (published by the Japanese Society of Mood Disorders). We conducted lectures on the guidelines and discussions using two clinical cases to describe the guidelines and how to apply them in practice. The participants received emails including URLs for self-administered web questionnaires. Using the questionnaires, they retrospectively rated their clinical behaviours in accordance with the clinical practice guidelines in the 6 months before the programme they attended, and they again rated themselves each year thereafter, for 2 years. The effectiveness of each programme was assessed based on changes in the scores of the selfadministered questionnaires before and after the programmes."

All of the participants attended a 1-day educational programme on schizophrenia and depression based on the clinical practice guidelines. Of these, 594 participants joined the email-based survey, 425 responded to the web questionnaires at baseline, 270 responded at 1 year and 140 responded at 2 years. Some participants have dropped out during each follow-up period. The numbers of participants who answered web questionnaires, excluding those who dropped out and those who reported \u2018no opportunity\u2019 for general use of the clinical guidelines at baseline and after the programmes, are shown in Supplementary Tables 4\u20136. They were aged 26\u201370 years, with an average age of 34.4 \u00b1 7.6 years; 369 (72.5%) were male. Years of professional experience ranged from 1 to 35 years, with an average of 5.7 \u00b1 6.7 years. A total of 463 belonged to university hospitals, 20 belonged to psychiatric hospitals, 25 belonged to general hospitals and one belonged to a clinic when attending the programme.\nChanges in the scores for clinical behaviours in accordance with the pre- and post-programme\nA comparison of all clinical behaviour scores in accordance with the guidelines at baseline and after the clinical practice guideline programmes is shown in Fig. 1. All of the mean scores had increased significantly at 1 year after attending the programme. Furthermore, the clinical behaviours of participants were still significantly higher at 2 years compared with the baseline, with the exception of\n2 https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.44 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\u2018Choosing treatment with modified electroconvulsive therapy for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia\u2019.\nThe mean and statistical results of the clinical behaviours in accordance with the general use of the guidelines for before and 2 years after programme participation are shown in Table 1, and the data of multiple comparisons are shown in Supplementary\nTable 7. In all subclasses of clinical behaviours consistent with the general use of the clinical guidelines, the mean scores increased significantly after attending the programme. Furthermore, the clinical behaviours of participants were maintained for 2 years, as the mean\nscore was not significantly different between 1 and 2 years after the programme. One year after attending the programme, a large and significant change was observed in \u2018Using treatment guidelines when deciding on the treatment policy in discussions with patients and family\u2019 (Z = 12.75, P = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u221237, r = 0.50).

Supplementary Table 8 shows the multiple comparison of clinical behaviour scores at baseline and 1 and 2 years after the programmes. The mean scores of all of the subclasses increased significantly after the programme. The clinical behaviours of participants, except \u2018Choosing treatment with modified electroconvulsive therapy for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia\u2019, weremaintained for 2 years.

The mean score of \u2018Choosing antipsychotic monotherapy but not a combination of antipsychotics\u2019 increased after the programme, and a significant change was observed (H = 75.74, P = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221217): the score was approximately 60 after the programme (46.4 at baseline, 60.5 at 1 year after the programme and 58.9 at 2 years after the programme). In addition, the mean score for \u2018Refraining from using psychotropic drugs other than antipsychotics\u2019 also increased significantly after the programme (H = 68.10, P = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221215), but the score was still <50 after the programme (31.7 at baseline, 44.1 at 1 year after the programme and 46.2 at 2 years after the programme). Although the score increased throughout the programme for \u2018For recovery from cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, refraining from using benzodiazepines\u2019 (H = 46.84, P = 6.7 \u00d7 10\u221211), the score at 2 years after the programme was 50.9.\nTable 3 shows the mean values and the statistical results of the clinical behaviours before and after the programme for the clinical practice guideline for major depressive disorder. The multiple comparisons of the clinical behaviour scores at baseline and 1 and 2 years after the programme are shown in Supplementary Table 9. In all subclasses, the mean scores increased significantly after attending the programme, and the clinical behaviours were maintained for 2 years.

These results suggest that our educational programmes could help to improve psychiatrists\u2019 clinical behaviours in accordance with the guidelines. To the best of our knowledge, no study has shown that educational programmes for clinical practice guideline have led to sustained improvements in clinical behaviour over years.\nPrevious studies have indicated that there could be a large gap between the development of evidence-based guidelines and their implementation in clinical settings,18,19,21\u201323 and that a combination of several guideline dissemination and implementation strategies aimed at healthcare professionals has failed to reduce antipsychotic polypharmacy for schizophrenia out-patients.24 The pathway from evidence to guidelines is highly developed, but the development of guideline implementation strategies has been insufficient and examined in only a few studies.22,25\u201327 Although the barriers to improving guideline adherence have not yet been generalised, some reports suggest that low awareness and dissemination of guidelines, as well as inadequate supply systems, could affect their\n46.2 \u00b125.3 65.7b \u00b122.8 65.2c \u00b121.1 116.36 5.4 \u00d7 10\u221226\n5 https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2022.44 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nimplementation.22,26 In this regard, the EGUIDE project has set up a supply system and provides the opportunity to learn about and become proficient in the guidelines.\nThe number of psychiatrists in Japan is almost 16 000, and approximately 1000 psychiatrists have already participated in the education programmes in the past 5 years. In 2020, only 6.3% of psychiatrists had completed these programmes, but the EGUIDE project estimates that 2000 psychiatrists will finish the programmes in the next 5 years. If >10% of psychiatrists in Japan achieve improvements in clinical behaviour in accordance with the clinical practice guidelines, treatment for schizophrenia and depression could change, which could lead to an improvement in quality of life for patients in Japan.\nTo better disseminate the clinical practice guidelines, the education programmes of the EGUIDE project need further improvement, and we seek to improve the delivery method annually. We revised the lecture materials associated with items for which knowledge was considered insufficient, and reported results suggesting that the revision of the lecture materials may have improved the degree of understanding of the clinical practice guidelines.28\nThis study has several limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting the results. First, because this study was performed in a single-arm design without a control group, it was difficult to assess the precise effectiveness of the programme despite it being a before-and-after comparison study. Second, since the questionnaires used to evaluate clinical behaviours in accordance with clinical practice guidelines were not validated, and we used a subjective method of assessment, it was unclear whether the questionnaire could adequately assess whether clinical behaviours were in accordance with clinical practice guidelines. Third, because of the lack of background information on the participants, we presumed that there might be many potential confounding factors related to the improvement of clinical behaviours. Fourth, although an annual web questionnaire survey works well as a reminder for past participants to recall the content of the educational programmes and make them aware of whether clinical behaviours are in accordance with clinical practice guidelines, this evaluation is subjective. To assess the precise effect of the education programme, it is necessary to assess changes in quality indicators, such as the prescriptions issued by participants. The results for the improvement of clinical knowledge of the clinical practice guidelines have already been published,20 and in-patient prescribing behaviour will be the object of another paper.\nDespite these limitations, the educational programme of the EGUIDE project is considered to be an effective means of guideline dissemination and education.
