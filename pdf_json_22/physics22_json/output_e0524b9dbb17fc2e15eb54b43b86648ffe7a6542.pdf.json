INTRODUCTION\nFor years, the problem of particle accumulation in fluid systems has been of great interest to engineers and scientists due to its ubiquity in natural phenomena and industrial applications.1\u201314 In this work, attention is paid to the convective transport of solid particles in a fluid due to pure thermovibrational convection. For the convenience of the reader who may not be an expert in these fields, in this introduction, first, the characteristics and main properties of this unique type of flow are briefly reviewed and then, a short description of the general factors that influence the formation of particle structures in liquids is provided. Finally, recent studies treating particle accumulation driven by thermovibrational effects are discussed, together with a critical assessment of the related gaps to \u201cbe filled\u201d (which constitute the natural pre-requisite for the definition of the objectives of the present study).\nThe simplest way to undertake such a treatment is to consider that thermovibrational convection may be regarded as a variant of natural convection induced by the simultaneous application of a temperature gradient and vibrations. A temperature inhomogeneity\nChaos 32, 103119 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0104680 32, 103119-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 22:54:10\nin a fluid can give rise to a change in its density, which, together with an acceleration field, typically results in the excitation of buoyancy forces and the generation of fluid motion. In particular, on Earth, the two classic scenarios leading to the onset of buoyant natural convection can be articulated into two main variants, namely, (a) the case where the temperature gradient is perpendicular to the driving force (leading to the so-called Hadley flow15) and (b) circumstances where the temperature gradient is parallel to the driving force (a very classical problem in fluid-dynamics, generally known as Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard or RB convection16). In standard terrestrial phenomena or technological applications, gravity constitutes the driving force leading to these two modes of convection; however, if it is replaced with (or superimposed onto) vibrations, thermovibrational flow is enabled. Seminal studies pioneering this type of fluid motion trace back to the 1970s and 1980s when Gershuni and co-workers17\u201319 first investigated the effects of vibrations on a fluid in weightlessness conditions.\nBefore delving into a brief review of the physics of this type of flow, it is also worth mentioning that scientist\u2019s interest in these phenomena coincides not by chance with the advent of microgravity platforms and the possibility to conduct experiments in space. More specifically, the influence of vibrations on fluid systems in space has evolved over the years from a curiosity driven problem to one attracting significant attention due to its connection with the undesired effects that the appreciable levels of residual acceleration present on space fairing vehicles and orbiting platforms, otherwise known as g-jitters, can have on fluid systems.20\u201323 These disturbances are caused by aerodynamic and aeromechanical forces and take the form of high frequency, low amplitude time-periodic displacements. The interested reader may consult Nelson24 for a detailed characterization of these effects in relation to material processing in space.\nGiven these premises, thermovibrational flow should be treated as a standalone type of convection. Leaving aside for a while the related technological implications, the complexity of this specific problem is intriguing to scientists as many factors contribute to its solution(s).17\u201319 These include, among others, the type of fluid considered (Newtonian/non-Newtonian, see, e.g., Refs. 25\u201327), the direction of the vibrations with respect to the temperature gradient,28,29 the boundary conditions of the system (including the heating conditions at the walls30 and the shape and size of the fluid container31), and the shaking amplitude and frequency. Accounts of the specific effects of the individual and combined factors mentioned above can be found in existing books, see, e.g., Ref. 32, and are not examined in detail in this work so as not to increase excessively its overall length.\nWhen particles are introduced into such convective systems, their response to the fluid flow follows standard rules already known for other fluid\u2013particle systems; namely, their behavior can depend on inertial mechanisms and other factors causing the particles to react in a more or less timely way to external stimuli. Delays in such a response can induce a departure of particle trajectories from the streamlines of the carrier flow, thereby causing non-linear effects that accumulate in time. These processes have been investigated to a large extent for a variety of flows resulting in a set of well-established results and theories.33\u201339\nWhen thermovibrational flows are considered, however, additional unique properties about the interaction between the fluid and\nparticles stem from the \u201ccyclic\u201d nature of the considered flow itself. Thermovibrational flow generally oscillates in time with a frequency that is, in most cases, proportional to that of the imposed shaking (identical, a multiple, or a sub-multiple), and this allows the aforementioned non-linear fluid\u2013particle interplay to undergo an iterative or self-sustained process, which over recent years has been found to result in previously unknown phenomena. Indeed, particles have been observed to cluster and form very regular structures with complex two-dimensional or three-dimensional morphology,40\u201346 which resemble that of geometrical entities, such as the \u201cconics\u201d and \u201cquadrics,\u201d whose properties are the main subject of analysis in the field of projective geometry.\nWhile the hidden mathematical laws underlying the emergence of such \u201corder\u201d have not been identified yet, much emphasis has been put on determining the critical links between the morphology of these aggregates (i.e., their shape as seen by an external observer) and the aforementioned \u201cenvironmental factors,\u201d i.e., the shape of the container hosting the fluid\u2013particle mixture, the directions of vibrations with respect to its walls, and the thermal behavior of such boundaries.41\u201344 All of these studies have assumed walls at a constant uniform temperature in order to support a unidirectional thermal gradient (needed to produce the thermovibrational flow itself).\nSome effort has also been provided in an attempt to classify these phenomena in terms of spatial multiplicity of the underlying attractors, i.e., the number of loci where the particles tend to be collected with time. These have been found to manifest themselves always in \u201ccouples\u201d; i.e., although in some circumstances, coalescence of the emerging structures is also possible and these may display a strong spatial asymmetry, particles always accumulate in two distinct regions of the physical volume inside the container.\nIn the present work, this specific problem is further explored by replacing the simple thermal boundary conditions assumed in earlier studies with more complex ones. The main objective is a more in-depth analysis of the multiplicity problem when the aforementioned main simplifications, i.e., the unidirectional nature of the imposed thermal gradient, are removed.\nBy doing so, we pursue a more complete characterization of this recently discovered class of phenomena. Leaving aside for a while the purely theoretical implications that attach to such a purpose, the present work also aims to discern additional useful details, which in the future may lead to the definition of new vibration-based \u201ccontrol\u201d techniques for the contactless manipulation of particles dispersed in a fluid. The related technological implications would be of great value. Suffice it to say that the properties of many composite/multiphase materials depend on the effective distribution of the related minority phase into a hosting matrix (the majority phase). Having the ability to control these would lead to significant improvements in many fields.9\u201314"

As three-dimensional effects have been reported to be mild in those cases (a departure from the morphology found in 2D becoming evident only in proximity to the walls delimiting the container in a direction perpendicular to the spanwise direction), here, 2D computations are intentionally used as a workhorse to investigate if and how the multiplicity of particle attractee revealed by earlier analyses can be somehow altered by removing the unidirectional temperature gradient constraint (which makes the two-dimensional approximation a logical choice in the context of the present investigation)."

This Poisson equation formally stems from expressing the physical velocity as the summation of the intermediate velocity and the pressure gradient and forcing this linear combination into the continuity equation. This system of equations is typically complemented by boundary conditions represented by the effective velocity on the boundary of the physical domain; accordingly, Neumann boundary conditions are used for the pressure. With ANSYS Fluent, the PISO algorithm is implemented in the frame of an implicit temporal approach. For the present simulations, a second order upwind spatial discretization scheme has been adopted for the convective terms appearing in the momentum and energy equations (standard central\ndifferences have been employed for the diffusive terms only). For what concerns the integration of the particle transport equation [Eq. (20)], ANSYS Fluent relies a 5th order Runge\u2013Kutta scheme. Unlike the approach implemented for the fluid phase, in this case, only the particle velocity appearing in the drag\nFluent, and dashed lines represent the results obtained from an in-house explicit code by Ref. 41.\nChaos 32, 103119 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0104680 32, 103119-5\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\nreported in Ref. 41.

For the sake of completeness, we should also mention that, in order to couple the Eulerian and Lagrangian kernels, we have used the \u201cbarycentric method\u201d to determine the fluid velocity at the instantaneous positions occupied by particles, and a bi-linear interpolation and first-order Euler schemes for the material derivative DV/Dt [both V and DV/Dt, indeed, appear at the right-hand side of Eq. (20) and need to be determined from the corresponding Eulerian fields accordingly].\nIV. VALIDATION\nGiven the unavailability of results by other authors about thermovibrationally driven particle\u2013fluid mixtures, following the same approach already undertaken by Ref. 46, we have assessed the accuracy of the numerical solver described in Sec. III through consideration of an in-house benchmark problem; i.e., the results provided by two independent computational platforms have been compared.\nFor this two-dimensional test case, vibrations perpendicular to the direction of the temperature gradient (Hadley-flow-like configuration) and adiabatic conditions at the sidewalls have been considered. The related non-dimensional parameters are summarized in Table I. A mesh size of 90 \u00d7 90 has been used.\nThe agreement found between the solver originally developed by Lappa41 and the present one (ANSYS Fluent version 2020R2) has been verified by looking at both the x and y velocity components, signals being taken at three locations in the cavity P1, P2, and P3 where P1 [0.25, 0.75], P2 [0.25, 0.5], and P3 [0.25, 0.25].\nAs quantitatively substantiated by Fig. 2, almost no distinction can be made between the results produced with ANSYS Fluent compared to those obtained with the in-house code by Ref. 41 (which unlike ANSYS Fluent is completely based on an explicit-in-time approach). An additional level of validation obviously stems from comparison of the emerging particle structures in terms of patterning behavior and size (Fig. 3). The minor differences in terms of lobe size visible in Fig. 3 can be ascribed to the different interpolation schemes used by Ref. 41 and ANSYS Fluent (the reader being also referred to the arguments reported in Ref. 46). We conclude that the\nTABLE II.

Just like in classic thermal convection problems, the parameter known to influence the \u201cstrength\u201d of convection is the Rayleigh number [shown in Eq. (12)]; in thermovibrational problems, this role is played by the vibrational Rayleigh number. The higher the Rayleigh number, the more complex the flow response and, therefore, the greater the number of grid points required to accurately capture the underlying physics. As in this study, the vibrational Rayleigh number is fixed to Ra\u03c9 = 1.56 \u00d7 10\n4 and Pr = 8; accordingly, the mesh refinement study is carried out assuming these specific values (see Tables II and III).\nThe outcomes of the grid refinement analysis are shown in Table IV.

            "text": "In this subsection, a brief description of each of the abovementioned four realizations is elaborated starting from the \u201cfour-loop\u201d type structure, identified by the circle symbol (\u2022) in Fig. 4. This structure type has been found at three locations in the map, i.e., at medium to high values of both \u03b3 and St. Moreover, as a distinguishing mark with respect to other cases, symmetry holds with respect to the x axis for y = 0.5 and about the y axis for a time dependent value xt, where xt is the point along the x axis representing the location of the vertical centerline of the structure. Four \u201cloops\u201d (or particle-dense \u201ccircuits\u201d) can clearly be recognized, each resembling a Cartesian oval (egg shape). From a practical (interpretative) standpoint, these ovals may be regarded as \u201cattractors\u201d to which all particle trajectories tend, easily revealed by numerical simulations when a statistically relevant number of particles is considered. In this regard, we wish also to recall that, as originally pointed out by Lappa,41 after a transient time, the related particle formations attain a well-defined (asymptotic) shape and size. Although the instantaneous structures keep oscillating along the direction of the vibrations, they give the observer the illusion of a \u201csolid body\u201d moving back and forth (which means that the instantaneous structures reported in Fig. 4 are fully representative of the related time-averaged counterparts).\nThe next formation we lend our attention to is the \u201ccentral pillar,\u201d found at six instances, represented by the square symbol ( ) in Fig. 4. As qualitatively substantiated by the insets in this figure, only one bulk structure emerges in this case, in contrast to the other three types where distinct particle aggregates exist, as also made evident by the \u201cinterposed\u201d clear (particle-free) fluid. The central pillar is formed primarily due to wall effects. Indeed, the simplest way to justify its existence is to consider that the displacement of the cavity along the x axis (i.e., the shaking direction) causes the particles to\nChaos 32, 103119 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0104680 32, 103119-7\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 22:54:10\nFIG. 5.

These behaviors have been found to be a key factor in influencing particle accumulation in thermovibrational problems when considering differentially heated cavities (Hadley flow type configuration) in both laminar41 and turbulent conditions.45 The interaction with the walls, however, is not the only influential factor. Convection still plays a role as witnessed by the tendency of the structure to contract in an hourglass shape as time passes (where the smallest extension along x is visible at y = 0.5).\nThe next case of the sequence, i.e., the accumulation represented by the diamond symbol ( ) in Fig. 4, is the rarest of all formations. Indeed, only two instances have been detected (for the range of parameters considered here). Denoted as \u201ctwo central structures,\u201d this variant shows up in the region of medium values of \u03b3 and high values of St. This case bares much similarity to the ( ) morphology; indeed, an even more pronounced constriction is visible at y = 0.5. What sets it apart from the other realizations is that the central column splits into two structures and a finite layer of clear fluid emerges through the center of the overall particle-dense region. The perimeter of the structure is also more defined when compared to the central pillar accumulation ( ), where the structure is \u201cclosed\u201d near the top and bottom walls.\nFinally, we turn to the \u201ctwo side extension\u201d variant, represented by a triangle symbol (N) in Fig. 4. The central region of accumulation visible here is very similar to the aforementioned central pillar represented by the square symbol ( ). In this case, however, the pillar is ornated by two elongated ovals at the left and right sides.\nHaving completed a description of the patterning behavior, as a concluding observation for this subsection, we wish to remark that two global symmetrical trends apply to all these cases.

            "text": "This subsection is devoted to a quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of these structures to the problem parameters in their respective ranges of existence. In this regard, we start from the remark that while a decrease in the particle size (i.e., a decrease in St) is expected to lead to less compact structures, a higher vibrational amplitude \u03b3 should have the opposite effect.44 It has also been demonstrated that under certain conditions, the tendency toward more cohesive formations due to an increase in the value of \u03b3 may be offset by a decrease in St and vice versa.\nNotably, a similar scenario can be discerned in Fig. 4, where diagonal trends in aggregate types are evident from the N-W to S-E regions of the map when \u03b3 decreases and St becomes larger. These observations are naturally complemented by the findings collected in Fig. 5, where the \u201ccharacteristic length\u201d of the structure has been reported as a function of time for each particle accumulation type. Given the different morphologies and the intrinsic multiplicity of the different formation types, the characteristic length is defined as follows: \u201cfour-loop\u201d type [Fig. 5(a)], the maximum size of a single loop along the y direction; \u201ctwo central structures\u201d [Fig. 5(b)], the maximum size of one of the two pillars along the x direction; \u201ccentral pillar accumulation\u201d [Fig. 5(c)], the horizontal width of the \u201cnecked\u201d region at half height of the cavity; and \u201ctwo side extensions\u201d [Fig. 5(d)], the maximum size of the side loop along the y direction.

By contrast, as qualitatively and quantitatively substantiated in Fig. 4, significant changes (simultaneous increase or decrease) in both St and \u03b3 can cause the transition from one structure type to another.\nB. Varying the vibrational frequency ( )\nAnother influential parameter is considered here (already identified in the frame of earlier studies where simpler thermal boundary conditions were considered), i.e., the frequency of vibrations ( ) defined in Eq.

In this section, three additional (lower) values of are considered for the following structure types: \u201ctwo side extensions\u201d (N, \u03b3 = 1.5 \u00d7 107 and St = 8.01 \u00d7 10\u22125) and the \u201cfour-loop\u201d type structure (\u2022, \u03b3 = 4 \u00d7 107 and St = 1.39 \u00d7 10\u22124).\nThe corresponding modifications in the \u201ctwo side extension\u201d variant (for = 1.2 \u00d7 103, = 1.3 \u00d7 103, and = 1.5 \u00d7 103) are summarized in Fig. 6. Interestingly, with an increase in the frequency of vibrations, the side ovals become more extended along the y axis. The central pillar, however, remains undisturbed up until a value of = 2 \u00d7 103, where two main lobes emerge resembling those pertaining to the \u201ctwo central structure\u201d case. This reinforces the idea of a seamless transition between different structure types as already discussed to a certain extent in Sec. VI A 2.\nThe quantitative increase in extension along both the x and y axis is detailed in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b). The structure formation time (defined here as the time required to obtain a state where the characteristic size of the structures and their distances remain constant) is also included in Fig. 7(c) for the sake of completeness. A rise of the formation time is observed when is increased, and these findings align with those by Ref. 44.\nThe analogous results for the \u201cfour-loop\u201d type structure are depicted in Figs. 8 and 9 (the range of values investigated here includes three additional values of : = 1.6 \u00d7 103, = 1.7 \u00d7 103, and = 1.85 \u00d7 103).\nA similar trend can be recognized in this case with a global increase in both the length of the x and y extensions of the ovals, together with a growth of the formational time when becomes higher.\nAll these findings can be naturally combined with those pertaining to the 2D map shown in Fig. 4. The outcomes of this exercise, by which the original 2D map is expanded through consideration\nof an additional degree of freedom (i.e., the vibration angular frequency), are shown in Fig. 10."

II A, the N-W and S-E corners of the cavity are set to Tcold and the N-E and S-W corners to Thot, leading to a symmetry about the x = y line.\nBefore starting to deal with this situation, at the risk of repetition (see Sec. I), we wish to recall once again that the direction of vibration is known to be an important influential factor in relation to the response of thermovibrational systems.41,42 Here, in particular, for consistency with the results presented for the companion case with non-inclined vibrations, the following case is assumed as a \u201cbasic\u201d configuration (to assess the changes induced by a variation in the shaking direction): Ra\u03c9 = 1.56 \u00d7 10\n4, = 2 \u00d7 103, \u03b3 = 6.5 \u00d7 106, St = 3.04 \u00d7 10\u22124, \u03be = 1.85, and \u03c6 = 0.\nAs shown in Fig. 11, the emerging structure bares much resemblance to the \u201ctwo side extension\u201d variant [the triangle symbol (N) in Fig. 4].

Second, if one looks at the location from which the side loops originate, while for the case presented in Sec.

            "text": "Placing the present results in a wider theoretical context requires a short excursus on the unique properties of this class of particle attractors and what has been understood until now in terms of underlying cause-and-effect relationships. In this regard, as already discussed to a certain extent in Sec. I, it is worth recalling that the present work adds another piece to the puzzle related to the existence of particle attractors in vibrationally driven flows, which do not depend on particle interactions (whose first piece was placed by Lappa41 with the discovery of a new class of self-induced particle aggregates in vibrated non-isothermal fluid systems in the framework of a one-way coupling approach). From looking back at these previous works, some useful arguments can be drawn, which can help to interpret the present one and elaborate a more general \u201cview\u201d of these phenomena and useful generalizations.\nIn particular, compelling evidence has been provided31,41 that particle attractors are made possible by the interplay of inertial and thermovibrational effects as indirectly proven by the suppression of particle structures in the limit as the density of the particles becomes equal to that of the surrounding liquid or the thermovibrational effect is disabled (while still allowing non-iso-dense particles to feel the acceleration produced by vibrations31,41). Convincing arguments have also been elaborated about the direct relationship between the effective spatial shape of the \u201cattractors\u201d (directly connected to the morphology of the particle structures emerging in the framework of one-way coupled numerical studies) and the relative direction of vibrations with respect to the solid boundary of the systems.41 According to these studies, if the angle between vibrations and the walls of the system is changed while vibrations remain perpendicular to the imposed temperature gradient, a zoo of structures can be obtained. Subsequent efforts42 have revealed that further modifications in the morphology can be induced by allowing vibrations to change their inclination with respect to the imposed temperature gradient, which has led to the main conclusion that the effective physical realization in space of particle structures is dictated by the threefold relationship between the shaking direction, that of the imposed (unidirectional) temperature gradient and the effective shape of the container physically hosting the fluid\u2013particle mixture.\nOther works of relevance to this subject have provided evidence that additional levels of complexity can be brought in by symmetry breaking effects emerging in the carrier flow itself in a \u201cspontaneous\u201d way (i.e., due to an intrinsic bifurcation of this flow, which would occur even in the absence of particles44) or produced as a result of the back influence of dispersed solid matter on such a flow (i.e., owing to a two-way coupled mechanism46).\nGiven these premises, the major contribution of the present study should, therefore, be seen in the new findings about the multiplicity of the attractors, i.e., the number N of attracting loci coexisting in the physical space at the same time. Evidence has been provided that this property can be somehow controlled by acting on the degree of thermal inhomogeneity of the fluid.\nThrough a generalization of a large number of results, it was previously concluded that this multiplicity N could not exceed a\nChaos 32, 103119 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0104680 32, 103119-11\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 22:54:10\nvalue N = 2 as the particle structures were always manifesting in couples or as a single large cohesive unit produced by the coalescence of two initially distinct aggregates. Although conducted under the constraint of a 2D flow, the present simulations have shown that even if the analysis is still limited to a case as simple as a square cavity, conditions can be identified for which several distinct formations (with N > 2) can co-exist within a single fluid domain.\nIn particular, by indicating with M the number of inversions in the temperature gradient through the fluid, the multiplicity for the first setting considered in the present work [case (1) shown in Fig. 1(a)] can be expressed as follows:\nN \u2264 2 + M. (24)\nThe significance of this inequality, which holds for a fixed value of \u03be , Ra\u03c9 , and (1.85, 1.56 \u00d7 10\n4, and = 2 \u00d7 103, respectively, in the present work), can be further explained or elucidated as follows: by changing the amplitude of vibrations (\u03b3 ) for a fixed size of particles (St) or, vice versa, changing the Stokes number for a fixed \u03b3 , topological changes can be induced in the emerging particle pattern, with the number of possible realization constrained to be less than or equal to 4.\nFor the second paradigm considered, i.e., the cavity shown in Fig. 1(b) [case (2) for which M = 1 and the vibrations can form an angle \u03c6 with the x axis], this relationship still holds provided a corrective factor is introduced to account for the inclination of the shaking direction, i.e.,\nN \u2264 2 + M + |sin (2\u03c6)|, (25)\nwhich indicates that the relative direction of vibrations can also affect the multiplicity parameter."

            "text": "The problem related to the formation of particle accumulation structures in thermovibrationally driven systems still carries a number of interesting questions, some of a general nature, other more system specific. In the present work, a first attempt has been made to understand if and how behaviors and mechanisms known to be effective under unidirectional temperature gradients can be mapped into systems with non-uniformly heated boundaries.\nEmerging structures have been categorized into specific classes depending on their appearance in the physical space. After running a statistically representative number of numerical simulations, it has been demonstrated that a colorful spectrum of variants is possible, which differ in terms of topology, morphology, and number of attracting loci. For a fixed couple (\u03be , Ra\u03c9), these accumulations exist through a multi-dimensional space of parameters [particle size (St), amplitude (\u03b3 ), frequency ( ), and angle (\u03c6) of vibrations] as a result of the reverberation of physical processes driven by thermovibrational (convective) and inertial (particle-related) effects into a confined space. The major outcome of the present study is that such phenomena can also be \u201ctuned\u201d or \u201ccontrolled\u201d to a certain extent by acting on the degree of thermal inhomogeneity of the system. On increasing the number of inversions of the temperature gradient inside the fluid, the multiplicity of the emerging structures grows accordingly and transition among different realizations can\nbe obtained on varying \u03b3 and/or St. Some correlations or relationships have been introduced in an attempt to model these behaviors. Although these may be regarded as still incomplete realizations of a more complete theory that shall be formulated to predict the properties of particle formations in all situations and as a function of all the influential parameters, this work should be considered a further step toward the complete characterization of the related dynamics. An interesting prospect for the future is the extension of this line of inquiry to the more general three-dimensional case for which the multiplicity of structures and the related response to changes in the system parameters and boundary conditions are expected to become even more intricate."
