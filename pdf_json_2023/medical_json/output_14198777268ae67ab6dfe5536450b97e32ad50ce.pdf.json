    "abstractText": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant dyslipidaemia, characterised by elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the blood. Three main genes are involved in FH diagnosis: LDL receptor (LDLr), Apolipoprotein B (APOB) and Protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) with genetic mutations that led to reduced plasma LDL-C clearance. To date, several PCSK9 gain-of-function (GOF) variants causing FH have been described based on their increased ability to degrade LDLr. On the other hand, mutations that reduce the activity of PCSK9 on LDLr degradation have been described as loss-of-function (LOF) variants. It is therefore important to functionally characterise PCSK9 variants in order to support the genetic diagnosis of FH. The aim of this work is to functionally characterise the p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 variant found in a subject suspected to have FH. Different techniques have been combined to determine efficiency of the autocatalytic cleavage, protein expression, effect of the variant on LDLr activity and affinity of the PCSK9 variant for the LDLr. Expression and processing of the p.(Arg160Gln) variant had a result similar to that of WT PCSK9. The effect of p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 on LDLr activity is lower than WT PCSK9, with higher values of LDL internalisation (13%) and p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 affinity for the LDLr is lower than WT, EC50 8.6 \u00b1 0.8 and 25.9 \u00b1 0.7, respectively. The p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 variant is a LOF PCSK9 whose loss of activity is caused by a displacement of the PCSK9 P\u2019 helix, which reduces the stability of the LDLr-PCSK9 complex.",

            "text": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant dyslipidaemia, characterised by elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the blood. Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia is one of the more common genetic diseases with a prevalence of 1:250\u2013300 in the general population [1]. FH patients have a high probability of developing cardiovascular disease, due to atherosclerotic lesions in the arterial endothelium caused by high plasma LDL-C concentrations. Regarding the aetiology of the disease, mutations in three genes involved in cholesterol metabolism are mainly responsible for the development of the disease: LDL receptor (LDLr), Apolipoprotein B (APOB) and Protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) [2]. Genetic alterations that occur in these genes reduce\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3330. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24043330 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3330 2 of 12\nplasma LDL-C clearance by different mechanisms. Mutations in the LDLR, responsible for LDL-C clearance from plasma, have been detected in the majority of FH patients (85%). On the other hand, mutations in APOB, which are responsible for 5\u201310% of FH cases, impair LDL\u2013LDLr binding, thus leading to LDL-C accumulation in the plasma [2]. Finally, gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PCSK9, a protein involved in the fine-tuning of LDLr expression at the plasma membrane, account for 1% of FH cases by an increased lysosomal degradation of the LDLr [3]. The human PCSK9 gene is located in the 1p32.3 region of the short arm of the first chromosome. The PCSK9 gene, a 22 kb sequence consisting of 12 exons and 11 introns, encodes a protein of 692 amino acids [4]. PCSK9 expression is transcriptionally regulated by the sterolregulatory element-binding protein (SREBP2), which regulates cholesterol metabolism. In fact, when the intracellular concentration of LDL-C is low, SREBP2 induces LDLR transcription together with PCSK9 [5]. The protein is distributed in five domains: N-terminal signal peptide (SP; 1\u201330 aa), propeptide or inhibitory prodomain (31\u2013152 aa), subtilisin/serin protease-like catalytic domain (SCD; 153\u2013451 aa) and the C-terminal cysteine- and histidinerich domain (CHRD; 452\u2013692 aa) [6]. PCSK9 is synthesised as a 74 kDa precursor, which becomes mature after an autocatalytic cleavage between residues 152\u2013153 rendering a 14 kDa prodomain, which binds non-covalently to the 60 kDa catalytic domain [6]. The autocatalytic cleavage is essential for protein secretion and also results in catalytic activity inhibition by hiding the catalytic triad (D186, H226 and S386) [7]. Once secreted, PCSK9 binds to the EGF-A domain of the LDLr, and the complex is endocytosed via clathrin-coated vesicles. Acidification of the endosome increases the affinity of the protein for the receptor that targets the PCSK9-LDLr complex to the lysosome leading to LDLr degradation [8]. Basal PCSK9 activity is necessary to maintain a balance in membrane LDLr levels, thus allowing an adequate degradation/recycling ratio. To date, several PCSK9 GOF variants that cause autosomal dominant hypercholesterolaemia (ADH) by reducing LDLr levels have been described [9]. On the other hand, LOF mutations that reduce the activity of PCSK9, showing an impaired ability to degrade LDLr have also been described [9\u201311]. It is therefore important to functionally characterise PCSK9 variants to validate the genetic diagnosis of ADH. The aim of this work is to functionally characterise the activity of the p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 variant, a variant accidentally found in a hypercholesterolemic patient. In order to carry out the functional characterisation, biophysics and molecular biology techniques have been combined to determine the efficiency of the autocatalytic cleavage, protein expression, the effect of p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 on LDLr activity and the affinity of p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 variant for the LDLr. To understand the mechanism by which p.(Arg160Gln) presents a reduced affinity for the LDLr, a computational study using AlphaFold has been used."

            "text": "Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was employed to sequence genes associated with Familial Hypercholesterolemia in the proband\u2019s sample. A missense PCSK9 mutation was identified: c.479 G > A in exon 3, p.(Arg160Gln). Subsequent cascade screening led to the identification of the same PCSK9 mutation in two of the five family members that were subjected to genetic analysis. (Figure 1). Lipid values of family members and PCSK9 genotypes are reported in Table 1. The information about lipid profiles obtained with the family pedigree demonstrated no clear correlation between the PCSK9 mutation and the high LDL-C phenotype as one of the carriers of the mutation had normal\u2013low LDL-C values. A high LDL-C phenotype with the p.(Arg160Gln) variant was present only in one of the three mutation carriers., which is not expected for a GOF PCSK9 variant. The ClinVar database describes the frequency of the identified PCSK9 mutation (c.479 G > A, p.Arg160Gln) of 0.00013 as it was found in 19/282782 chromosomes in the general population (data from the Genome Aggregation Database, gnomAD). The mutation was reported in three subjects with suspected autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia and in one\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3330 3 of 12\nsubject with hypobetalipoproteinemia (ClinVar database). The variant has been also reported in the literature in a GWAS study observed in one individual with low LDL-C [12]. The available evidence was not sufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease conclusively. For that reason, we decided to functionally characterise the effect on the PCSK9 protein. We analysed the potential consequences of the p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 variant with the in silico prediction programs Mutation Taster, Polyphen-2 PROVEAN; SIFT, Mutation Assessor, FATHMM and PANTHER. The variant was classified as a probably damaging to disease causing PCSK9 variant (Table 2). To our knowledge, no experimental evidence studying the impact of the mutation on protein function has been reported.\nInt.\u00a0J.\u00a0Mol.\u00a0Sci.\u00a02023,\u00a024,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 12\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\np.Arg160Gln)\u00a0of\u00a00.00013\u00a0as\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0found\u00a0in\u00a019/282782\u00a0chromosomes\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0general\u00a0popu\u2010 lation\u00a0 (data\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0Genome\u00a0Aggregation\u00a0Database,\u00a0gnomAD).\u00a0The\u00a0mutation\u00a0was\u00a0re\u2010 ported\u00a0in\u00a0three\u00a0subjects\u00a0with\u00a0suspected\u00a0autosomal\u00a0dominant\u00a0hypercholesterolemia\u00a0and\u00a0in\u00a0 one\u00a0subject\u00a0with\u00a0hypobetalipoproteinemia\u00a0(ClinVar\u00a0database).\u00a0The\u00a0variant\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0also\u00a0 reported\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0literature\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0GWAS\u00a0study\u00a0observed\u00a0in\u00a0one\u00a0individual\u00a0with\u00a0low\u00a0LDL\u2010C\u00a0 [12].\u00a0The\u00a0available\u00a0evidence\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0sufficient\u00a0to\u00a0determine\u00a0the\u00a0role\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0variant\u00a0in\u00a0dis\u2010 ease\u00a0conclusively.\u00a0For\u00a0that\u00a0reason,\u00a0we\u00a0decided\u00a0to\u00a0functionally\u00a0characterise\u00a0the\u00a0effect\u00a0on\u00a0 the\u00a0PCSK9\u00a0protein.\u00a0 We\u00a0ana sed\u00a0the\u00a0potential\u00a0consequences\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0p.(Arg160Gln)\u00a0PCSK9\u00a0variant\u00a0with\u00a0 the\u00a0in\u00a0silico\u00a0prediction\u00a0programs\u00a0Mutation\u00a0Taster,\u00a0Polyphen\u20102\u00a0PROVEAN;\u00a0SIFT,\u00a0Mutation\u00a0 Assessor,\u00a0FATHMM\u00a0and\u00a0PANTHER.\u00a0The\u00a0variant\u00a0was\u00a0classified\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0probably\u00a0damaging\u00a0 to\u00a0disease\u00a0causing\u00a0PCSK9\u00a0variant\u00a0(Table\u00a02).\u00a0To\u00a0our\u00a0knowledge,\u00a0no\u00a0experimental\u00a0evidence\u00a0 studying\u00a0the\u00a0impact\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0mutation\u00a0on\u00a0protein\u00a0function\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0reported.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a01.\u00a0Family\u00a0pedigree\u00a0showing\u00a0the\u00a0carriers\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0p.(Arg160Gln)\u00a0PCSK9\u00a0variant.\u00a0Half\u2010blackened\u00a0\nindicates\u00a0heterozygous\u00a0carriers\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0p.(Arg160Gln)\u00a0variant.\u00a0The\u00a0arrow\u00a0represents\u00a0 the\u00a0proband.\u00a0\nAge\u00a0(in\u00a0years)\u00a0and\u00a0LDL\u2010C\u00a0(mg/dL)\u00a0are\u00a0given.\u00a0\u201c?\u201d\u00a0unknown.\u00a0\nTable\u00a01.\u00a0Sex,\u00a0age,\u00a0lipid\u00a0profiles\u00a0and\u00a0mutational\u00a0status\u00a0of\u00a0proband\u00a0and\u00a0family\u00a0members\u00a0characterised\u00a0 during\u00a0the\u00a0study.\u00a0TC,\u00a0LDL\u2010C,\u00a0HDL\u2010C\u00a0and\u00a0TG\u00a0are\u00a0expressed\u00a0in\u00a0mg/dL.\u00a0\nSubject\u00a0 Sex\u00a0 Age\u00a0 TC\u00a0 LDL\u2010C\u00a0 HDL\u2010C\u00a0 TG\u00a0 p.(Arg160 Gln)\u00a0\nProband\u00a0 F\u00a0 50\u00a0 341\u00a0 275\u00a0 59\u00a0 139\u00a0 YES\u00a0 Son\u00a0 M\u00a0 27\u00a0 282\u00a0 175\u00a0 76\u00a0 199\u00a0 NO\u00a0\nBrother\u00a0 M\u00a0 54\u00a0 200\u00a0 154\u00a0 39\u00a0 98\u00a0 YES\u00a0\nNephew\u00a01\u00a0 M\u00a0 28\u00a0 169\u00a0 99\u00a0 53\u00a0 88\u00a0 YES\u00a0\nNephew\u00a02\u00a0 M\u00a0 24\u00a0 136\u00a0 78\u00a0 51\u00a0 51\u00a0 NO\u00a0 Nephew\u00a03\u00a0 M\u00a0 29\u00a0 187\u00a0 134\u00a0 44\u00a0 132\u00a0 NO\u00a0\nTable\u00a02.\u00a0In\u00a0silico\u00a0predictions\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0impact\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Arg160Gln\u00a0mutation\u00a0on\u00a0PCSK9\u00a0protein\u00a0using\u00a0dif\u2010 ferent\u00a0online\u00a0tools.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Mutation\u00a0 Taster\u00a0 PolyPhen\u2010 2\u00a0 PROVEA N\u00a0 SIFT\u00a0 Mutation\u00a0 Assessor\u00a0 FATHM M\u00a0 PANTHER\u00a0\np.(Arg160G ln)\u00a0 Disease\u00a0 Causing\u00a0 Probably\u00a0 damaging\u00a0 Deleteri\u2010 ous\u00a0 Damag\u2010 ing\u00a0 High\u00a0Im\u2010 pact\u00a0 Damag\u2010 ing\u00a0 Probably\u00a0Dam\u2010 aging\u00a0\nTable 1.

            "text": "Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia is the most common genetic disease, which requires early detection and appropriate treatment to reduce cardiovascular events [1]. In recent years, and thanks to massive sequencing of DNA, many variants of genes involved in the development of FH have been identified; however, not all of them are pathogenic [1,9,16,17]. Although genetic analyses constitute an important step for diagno-\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 3330 7 of 12\nsis, establishing the pathogenicity of these variants through functional studies is essential to make an accurate diagnosis [18]. In the present work we have functionally characterised the effect of the p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 variant to find out whether its function is altered or not. This variant was identified in a 50 y/o female in postmenopausal state with high LDL-C levels. Cascade screening in five family members was not conclusive to establish the supposed \u201cgain-of-function\u201d of the mutated PCSK9 protein. In particular the mutation was identified in a 28 y/o male with normal/low LDL-C. In silico prediction of the effect of the mutation supported a deleterious impact of the mutation on the protein function, but, for obvious reason, without giving advice on gain or loss of protein function. For the p.(Arg160Gln) mutation, a very low frequency was described in genomic databases and it was identified in both hyperand hypo-cholesterolemic conditions. The available evidence was considered insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease conclusively. Therefore, this variant was classified as a variant of uncertain significance, claiming that its association with disease require further investigation. The p.(Arg160Gln) mutation is located at the beginning of the PCSK9-catalytic domain, as shown in the present work; expression/processing and secretion of the variant is not affected. Interestingly, the higher values of LDL internalisation in cells expressing p.(Arg160Gln) indicates that the activity of p.(Arg160Gln) on LDLr activity is lower compared to WT PCSK9. Therefore, the functional characterisation performed in this work indicates that p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 is a LOF variant, thus, is not responsible of the patient\u2019s phenotype. In addition, the LOF activity of the p.(Arg160Gln) variant was corroborated by determining its affinity for the LDLr, which showed a reduced EC50 for the LDLr compared to that of WT PCSK9. We next sought to understand the mechanism by which the p.(Arg160Gln) variant shows a reduced affinity for the LDLr. It has been described that autocatalysis is critical for PCSK9 secretion and endows LDLr-binding capacity by exposing the EGF(A)-binding site [19]. The autocatalytic cleavage occurs between the last prodomain residue, Gln152 (P1 residue; nomenclature of Schechter and Berger) and the first residue of the catalytic domain Ser153 (P1\u2032 residue). Once cleaved, a spring-loaded mechanism is triggered and P\u2032 amino acids translocate into a groove located next to the LDLr-binding site (Figure 6). The EGF(A)interacting site of PCSK9 is a solvent-exposed area of ~530 \u00c52 that is largely flat, featureless and devoid of binding pockets. Therefore, if electrostatic forces are not strong enough, binding and maintaining the PCSK9-LDLr complex could be compromised. Interestingly, the stretch of P\u2032 residues (Ser153\u2013Thr162) adopts an \u03b1-helical conformation, termed the P\u2032 helix, in which P1\u2032 Ser153 and P3\u2032 Pro155 contribute to the stabilisation of the bound LDLr-EGF(A) domain through polar and van der Waals interactions [20,21]. In addition, the Arg160 residue contributes specifically to binding affinity and specificity by forming a salt bridge with the LDLr Asp343 residue [19]. As Gln has no charge, replacement of the positively charged Arg160 by Gln abrogates the interaction with the negatively charged Asp343 of the LDLr. Hence, the loss of this electrostatic interaction can contribute to the reduced affinity determined here of the p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 variant for the LDLr. By using AlphaFold, we have also determined that replacement of Arg160 by Gln affects the conformation of the 153\u2013168 P\u2019 residues. P\u2019 helix modelling shows that the substitution causes a change in helix rotation, which results in a complete displacement of the amino acids involved in the stabilisation of PCSK9-EGF-A binding (Figures 5 and 6). It seems plausible that this predicted displacement of the PCSK9 P\u2019 helix in p.(Arg160Gln) variant represents the main reason for the lower affinity of the variant for the LDLr.\nInt. J. Mol.

Suggested mechanisms leading to loss of affinity of the p.(Ard160Gln) PCSK9 variant for the LDLr. (A) Upon prodomain cleavage, P\u2032 helix is located next to the LDLr-binding site and strengthens the electrostatic forces for binding and maintaining the PCSK9-LDLr complex. Additionally, the Arg160 residue for s a salt bridge with the LDLr Asp343 residue. (B) R placement f Arg160 by a Gln modifies the change the direction of rotatio of the P\u2019 helix, which no longer remains close to the EGF-A residues implicated in PCSK9 binding.\nAccording to the obt ined results, we can conclude that the p.(Arg160Gln) PCSK9 variant is a LOF PCSK9 variant whose loss of activity is caused by a displacement of the PCSK9 P\u2019 helix, which reduces the stability of the LDLr-PCSK9 complex, thus not causative of familial hypercholesterolemia."
