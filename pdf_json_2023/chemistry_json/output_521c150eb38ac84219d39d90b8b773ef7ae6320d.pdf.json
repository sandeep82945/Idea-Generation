Naciuk et al. conducted substitution of isoquinolin-5,8-dione followed by cross dehydrogenative coupling to obtain an isomer of ellipticine quinone (3).20 This strategy of B-ring formation attracted our attention due to its unprecedented route to ellipticine quinone (3) and ellipticine (1). However, the regioselective substitution of isoquinolin-5,8dione would appear to hamper the synthesis of ellipticine (1), because isoquinolin-5,8-dione favors C7 substitution.21 Considering that the synthesis of ellipticine (1) and isoellipticine (2) started from different starting materials and through different synthetic pathways. This study was aimed to develop a convergent pathway to ellipticine (1) and isoellipticine (2), beginning with the same starting material. This benets the simultaneous comparison of their biological activity in the same study. For instance, this study tested the enzymatic activity of 1 and 2 against myosin light chain kinase family member 4 (MYLK4), which is correlated to the development of acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, this feasible synthetic methodology could be applied to understand the structure\u2013 activity relationship of (iso)ellipticine analogues in further study."

            "text": "The synthesis of isoellipticine (2) is shown in Scheme 1. The reaction of isoquinolin-5-ol (5) with [bis(triuoroacetoxy)iodo] benzene (PIFA) followed by the addition of aniline generated predominantly compound 6 together with trace amounts of its regioisomer (9). This regioselective substitution of isoquinolin5,8-dione was also observed by Naciuk20 and Shin.22 Following reported methodology, isoellipticine quinone (4) was converted into isoellipticine (2).16,20 In comparison with Naciuk's work, this pathway is expeditious, generating isoellipticine (2) in four steps with a 19% overall yield.\nDue to the predominant selective C7 substitution of isoquinolin-5,8-dione, an alternative synthetic route is required to achieve C6 substitution. Halogen atoms and methoxy substituent are helpful in the regioselective substitution of (iso) quinolinediones. A trial reaction of 6-bromoisoquinolin-5,8dione with aniline failed to form the anticipated product (9). In 2016, Zhao et al. reported a methodology fullling regioselective amination of phenol, which encouraged us to reorder the synthetic sequence.23 We tried to obtain 6-(phenylamino) isoquinolin-5-ol (7) using Zhao's methodology, and then to oxidize 7 to obtain 6-(phenylamino)isoquinoline-5,8-dione (9, Scheme 2). Interestingly, the reaction of isoquinolin-5-ol (5) with aniline in the presence of potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) under the irradiation of blue light gave unexpectedly a p-iminoquinone (8) containing two anilino moieties as judged by NMR and mass spectra. We hydrolyzed 8 with acetic acid and H2O24 under reux, yielding the anticipated compound (9). This result revealed that one aniline group had indeed been introduced at C6 of the isoquinoline-5,8-dione, and p-iminoquinone\n31596 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 31595\u201331601\n(8) was the product of the K2S2O8-mediated reaction. Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Coherence (HMBC) and Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments were conducted to conrm the structure of the proposed p-iminoquinone (8), specically the position of the imine moiety (Fig. 2\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The proton at dH 9.81 ppm (H-1) in the NMR spectrum of 8 showed correlation with the 13C-NMR spectra reported by Pradhan et al.25 with a 13C-NMR signal at dC 154.10 ppm which is from the carbon atom (C-8) of the imine moiety. Correlations between the carbonyl carbon at dC 181.56 ppm (C6) and protons at dH 7.96 ppm (H-4) signied the existence of a C]O group at the C-6 position. The quinone proton signal in 8 at dH 6.72 ppm displayed NOESY signals between H-2\n\u2032 and H-2\u2032 \u2032. This result revealed that this quinone proton is H-7 and is located between the two phenyl moieties. Together with the results of hydrolysis product, HMBC and NOESY, we concluded that the K2S2O8-mediated reaction generated the p-iminoquinone (8). The following Pd-catalyzed cyclization converted compound 9 to the ellipticine quinone (3), which was subjected to reaction with CH3Li and then NaBH4 to generate ellipticine (1).\nThe scope and mechanism of the unexpected generation of p-iminoquinone (8) attracted our attention and we conducted the experiments shown in Table 1. Results from entries 1 and 3 in Table 1 indicated that this reaction proceeds independently of visible light. The increase of equivalence of aniline resulted in an increase in the reaction yield (entry 2). No conversion was observed in the presence of free radical scavengers such as TEMPO, BHT and benzoquinone (entries 4\u20136), which suggests a free radical mechanism for the formation of 8. In thermal reaction conditions the reaction time is dramatically shortened (entries 7 and 8), and 8 was obtained in a reaction time of 1 h, indicating that the reaction can be conducted through either a photo- or thermal-mediated pathway.\nPradhan et al. reported the synthesis of p-iminoquinone using nitrosobenzene in the presence of hexauoroisopropanol (HFIP).25 This study led us to examine the reaction of aniline with K2S2O8 in the absence of isoquinolin-5-ol (5). This reaction failed to generate nitrosobenzene, revealing the involvement of a pathway different from the route proposed by Pradhan et al. In light of the results in Table 1, a radical mechanism for the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ngeneration of p-iminoquinone (8) was proposed and is shown in Scheme 3. The potassium persulfate was photochemically or thermally cleaved to generate the corresponding sulfate radical which subsequently converted 5 into the radical (A). The addition of an aniline molecule followed by loss of a single electron resulted in another radical (C). A second aniline molecule was introduced and the subsequent oxidation generated the p-iminoquinone (8).\nIn an attempt to understand the scope of the K2S2O8-mediated synthesis of p-iminoquinones, we selected three heterocyclic compounds (10\u201312) each bearing one \u2013OH group attached to the carbon adjacent to the ring fusion bond. Under the reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 8), compounds 10\u201312 were converted into the corresponding p-iminoquinones (13\u201315, Table 2). The resulting products produce the corresponding quinone derivatives through acetic acid-mediated hydrolysis. This methodology is helpful for regioselective synthesis of anilinoquinones because the position of the \u2013OH determines the regioselectivity. A survey of the literature showed that reaction of aniline with persulfate yields polyaniline,26 which could explain the very low yield of the reaction.\nScheme 3 Plausible reaction mechanism.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 31595\u201331601 | 31597\nFig. 3 Analysis of protein\u2013ligand interactions.

In addition, some (iso) ellipticine derivatives were reported displaying kinase inhibition,30,31 which encouraged us to examine the effect of compounds 1\u20134 on MYLK4 and AML cells. Table 3 shows the enzymatic activity of compounds 1\u20134 against MYLK4. The result revealed that ellipticine (1) and isoellipticine (2) showed marked MYLK4 inhibitory activity as compared with their synthetic precursors (3 and 4), with IC50 values of 7.1 and 6.1 nM, respectively. Due to their distinct MYLK4 inhibitory activity, compounds 1 and 2were tested for their cellular activity against MV-4-11 and MOLM-13 cells. Despite the appearance of comparable kinase activity of compounds 1 and 2, 1 showed better AML activity than 2. Ellipticine (1) inhibited the growth of MV-4-11 andMOLM-13 cells with IC50 values of 1.19 and 1.0 mM, respectively. These results suggested that (iso)ellipticine could pave ways to the development of MYLK4 inhibitors for the treatment of AML."

Molecular docking was used to determine if the MYLK4 inhibitors in this study can favorably bind to MYLK4. The binding poses of 1 and 2 showed the occupation of areas associated with the adenosine ring of ATP. Both 1 and 2were observed to form hydrogen bonds to V183 (Fig. 3). V183 forms part of the hinge loop, suggesting favorable occupation of the binding site. An additional hydrogen bond to the carbonyl backbone of residue L112 was also observed. These hydrogen bonds were facilitated by the nitrogen atoms present in the ring structures. The core structure of 1 and 2 provided more \u2018rigidity\u2019 to the compound and formed hydrophobic interactions with amino acids with aliphatic side chains, such as residues L112, V120, V183, L188, L234, and I246. Compound 2 generated additional hydrophobic interactions. This may be due to the location of its nitrogen atom as it formed a hydrogen bond to the hinge residue V183, which caused compound 2 to occupy a slightly different orientation toward residues G113, A133, and M180. This hydrophobic region also explains the distinct lose of MYLK4 activity of 3 and 4, due to appearance of two carbonyl groups. In addition, it guides the structural optimization by introducing hydrophobic substituents on A-ring in the future. Together, the docking results show favorable occupation of the MYLK4 binding site, and their interactions may facilitate their inhibitory activity."
