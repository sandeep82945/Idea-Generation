Lactic acidosis, a hallmark of solid tumour microenvironment, originates from lactate hyperproduction and its co-secretion with protons by cancer cells displaying the Warburg effect. Long considered a side effect of cancer metabolism, lactic acidosis is now known to play a major role in tumour physiology, aggressiveness and treatment efficiency. Growing evidence shows that it promotes cancer cell resistance to glucose deprivation, a common feature of tumours. Here we review the current understanding of how extracellular lactate and acidosis, acting as a combination of enzymatic inhibitors, signal, and nutrient, switch cancer cell metabolism from the Warburg effect to an oxidative metabolic phenotype, which allows cancer cells to withstand glucose deprivation, and makes lactic acidosis a promising anticancer target. We also discuss how the evidence about lactic acidosis’ effect could be integrated in the understanding of the whole-tumour metabolism and what perspectives it opens up for future research. 1. conclusions Lactic acidosis associated with tumour progression allows cancer cells to survive in unfavourable environments. In the last decade, the influence of neoplastic lactic acidosis on the energy metabolism of cancer cells has been deciphered. Lactic reduces glycolysis and lactic fermentation, stimulates the TCA cycle and OxPhos, and promotes the use of alternative nutrients. All in all, it contributes to cell resistance to glucose deprivation. Cancelling lactic acidosis’ effect is therefore a relevant anticancer strategy that restores cancer cell sensitivity to glucose deprivation, a common feature of the tumour microenvironment.
