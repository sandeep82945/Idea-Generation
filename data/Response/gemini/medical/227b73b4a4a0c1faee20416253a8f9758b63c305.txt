1. **Investigate the use of nanotechnology to improve the delivery of anti-cancer drugs to tumors.** Nanoparticles can be engineered to target specific cells or tissues, and they can also be used to deliver drugs in a controlled manner. This could potentially improve the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs and reduce their side effects.


2. **Develop new methods for administering anti-cancer drugs directly to tumors.** This could involve using catheters, needles, or other devices to deliver drugs directly to the tumor site. This could potentially improve the concentration of drugs in the tumor and reduce the risk of side effects.


3. **Study the use of combination therapies that involve both systemic and regional administration of anti-cancer drugs.** This could potentially improve the efficacy of treatment by targeting tumors from multiple angles. For example, a systemic drug could be used to kill cancer cells throughout the body, while a regional drug could be used to target tumors that are resistant to the systemic drug.


4. **Investigate the use of immunotherapy to treat cancer.** Immunotherapy is a type of treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer. This could potentially be a more effective and less toxic way to treat cancer than traditional chemotherapy or radiation therapy.


5. **Develop new methods for monitoring the response of tumors to treatment.** This could involve using imaging techniques, blood tests, or other methods to track the size and activity of tumors. This information could be used to adjust treatment plans and improve the chances of a successful outcome.
