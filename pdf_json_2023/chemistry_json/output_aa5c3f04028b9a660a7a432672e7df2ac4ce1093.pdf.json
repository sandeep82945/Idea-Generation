    "abstractText": "Impaired polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) functions contribute to increased infections and cardiovascular diseases in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Uremic toxins reduce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels and the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of H2S. Its biosynthesis occurs as a side process of transsulfuration and in the disposal of adenosylhomocysteine, a transmethylation inhibitor and proposed uremic toxin. PMNL chemotaxis was measured by the under-agarose method, phagocytosis, and oxidative burst by flow cytometry in whole blood and apoptosis by determining DNA content by flow cytometry and morphological features by fluorescence microscopy. Sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS), diallyl trisulphide (DATS) and diallyl disulphide (DADS), cysteine, and GYY4137 were used as H2S-producing substances. Increased H2S concentrations did not affect chemotaxis and phagocytosis. NaHS primed PMNL oxidative burst activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or E. coli. Both DATS and cysteine significantly decreased E. coli-activated oxidative burst but had no effect on PMA stimulation. While NaHS, DADS, and cysteine attenuated PMNL apoptosis, GYY4137 decreased their viability. Experiments with signal transduction inhibitors suggest that the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is mainly involved in GYY4137-induced PMNL apoptosis and that GYY4137 and cysteine target signaling downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase.",

            "text": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) inhibits essential enzymes and exerts toxic effects at several levels [1,2]. Therefore, H2S was previously only known as a dangerous gas. However, recent studies have shown that H2S can also be produced endogenously, thus exhibiting important physiological effects at lower concentrations [3]. For example, H2S is able to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes [4] and is involved in the regulation of blood pressure [5]. By regulating the activity of endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and perivascular nerves, H2S leads to vasorelaxation [6]. Recently, it has also been shown that H2S mediates plaque stability [7]. H2S has both neuro-modulating and neuro-protective functions by increasing the production of the anti-oxidative glutathione in neurons exposed to oxidative stress [8,9]. Along with the more familiar carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, H2S belongs to the family of gasotransmitters. Under physiological conditions, it is mostly dissociated (86%), and only 14% exists as a gas. Gaseous H2S can easily diffuse through cell membranes due to its lipophilicity [1].\nToxins 2023, 15, 198. https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins15030198 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/toxins\nToxins 2023, 15, 198 2 of 21\nThe plasma levels of H2S in patients with coronary heart disease, hypertension, and smokers are lower compared to the healthy reference group [5]. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also associated with significant reduction of H2S plasma levels [5]. Deficiency of H2S and its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties may contribute to the progression of CKD and mortality [2]. H2S biosynthesis inhibitors significantly worsen renal parameters [10]. The retention of many substances that are normally filtered by healthy kidneys leads to the development of the uremic syndrome. Retention solutes that negatively interact with biologic functions are called uremic toxins [11] and play a central role in impairing polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) functions in CKD patients [12]. Uremic toxins are responsible for the reduction in H2S concentration and its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. While H2S is decreased in uremic patients on hemodialysis, lanthionine, a nonproteinogenic amino acid and byproduct of H2S biosynthesis, is increased [13]. Due to its ability to impair H2S synthesis in hepatoma cells, it is considered a novel uremic toxin [14]. Furthermore, the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate impairs H2S formation in renal tubular cells [15]. Cyanate, a uremic toxin produced by the decomposition of urea in CKD patients, leads to a carbamoylation reaction [16\u201318] that abolishes the antioxidant and cytoprotective activity of H2S [19]. Immune dysfunction and particularly disturbed PMNL functions are a main cause of the high risk of infections and cardiovascular diseases and, as a result, increased morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD [12]. PMNLs are cells of the primary non-specific cellular immune response and play a crucial role in the defense against bacterial and fungal infections. Disturbed functions of PMNLs lead to a higher risk of bacterial infections and cardiovascular diseases and are a major cause of the increased risk of morbidity and mortality among CKD patients [12]. After chemotactic movement to the source of infection, PMNLs take up the invading microorganisms by phagocytosis and kill them with proteolytic enzymes intracellularly released from granula and with reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during the oxidative burst. These critical PMNL functions can be impaired, leading to infectious diseases or pre-activated/primed, causing inflammation and subsequently cardiovascular disease. The coordinated elimination of activated PMNLs is essential for the resolution of inflammation [20]. Increased apoptosis results in a decreased immune response, whereas delayed apoptosis of PMNLs or impaired clearance of apoptotic PMNLs by macrophages causes inflammation [21]. In uremia, the balance between proand anti-inflammatory and between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors is disturbed. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effect of H2S on several essential PMNL functions using the H2S-producing substances sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), diallyl trisulfide (DATS) and diallyl disulfide (DADS), cysteine, and GYY4137."

The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 alone increased PMNL apoptosis (Figure 6A,B), consistent with reports that p38 MAPK is responsive as a part of a cell survival signaling pathway in PMNLs [22\u201325].\nToxins 2023, 15, 198 6 of 21To i 6 of 21\nToxins 2023, 15, 198 7 of 21\nToxins 2023, 15, 198 7 of 21\nthe other hand, SB203580 had a slight additive effect on GYY4137-induced apoptosis.

Protein persulfidation, a posttranslational modification of cysteine residues to persulfides caused by H2S, is an important mechanism of H2S-mediated signaling pathways [43]. Divergent results have been reported regarding the effects of H2S on the immune system [44,45]. Some studies report a pro-inflammatory effect of H2S. In models of inflammation\nToxins 2023, 15, 198 10 of 21\nsuch as sepsis, endotoxic, and hemorrhagic shock, increased levels of H2S were observed. Furthermore, the cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE) inhibitor DL-propargylglycine leads to reduced inflammation [46\u201350]. Other studies described H2S as an anti-inflammatory molecule, e.g., inhibiting TNF\u03b1 and lipopolysaccharides-stimulated NF-\u03baB activation [51,52]. H2S modifies inflammatory responses on the level of endothelium and leukocytes [53]. In addition, it reduces monocyte cell adhesion and relevant inflammatory triggering by preventing ADAM17dependent TNF-\u03b1 activation [54]. The plasma levels of H2S in patients with coronary heart disease, hypertension, and smokers are lower than in the healthy reference group [5]. A study by Whiteman et al. showed that patients with obesity or type-2 diabetes had decreased H2S plasma levels [55]. CKD is associated with significantly reduced H2S production and H2S plasma levels [56]. In end-stage kidney disease patients, in contrast to the low levels of H2S, the plasma concentrations of cysteine and homocysteine are elevated [56]. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and leads to downregulation of CBS, CSE, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) in the kidneys and liver, resulting in decreased H2S plasma levels [57]. The deficiency of H2S and its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective properties may contribute to the progression of CKD and its mortality [2]. Infusion of L-cysteine into the renal artery to raise the endogenous production of H2S resulted in an increase in GFR [58]. The uremic milieu and uremic toxins in particular play a key role in the reduction of H2S levels in renal disease. Many risk factors affecting increased cardiovascular mortality in CKD are associated with uremic toxins and their derivatives [59]. The metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids is mainly affected. Lanthionine, a by-product of H2S biosynthesis, has historically served as a marker for H2S production. Lanthionine plasma levels are considerably elevated in uremic patients, and it has been categorized as a new uremic toxin [14]. Lanthionine is removed to some extent by a single dialysis session, which is accompanied by an increase in H2S levels [13]. In endothelial cells, lanthionine inhibits H2S release by decreasing the protein content and glutathionylation of CBS. The uremic toxin nature of lanthionine has also been evaluated in a zebrafish animal model [60]. The uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate downregulates the H2S-generating enzymes CSE, CBS, and 3-MST [15]. This effect was reversed by inhibiting the receptor for indoxyl sulfate, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. The uremic toxin cyanate is produced by the decomposition of urea. It can inhibit the scavenging of free radicals by H2S via carbamoylation and thereby contributes to the increased oxidative stress in CKD patients [19]. For H2S to serve as an endogenously produced messenger, tissue production and catabolism must result in intracellular microenvironments with a sufficiently high H2S concentration to activate a local signaling mechanism [61]. The concentration of H2S in mammalian plasma may be substantially increased in certain microenvironments, e.g., H2S release from bound sulfur [62]. Increased sulfide levels of up to 1 mM have been reported at infected sites in polymicrobial infections during periodontal disease [63]. H2S production from L-cysteine involves the enzymes CBS, CSE, and 3-MST. Pyridoxal phosphate is a coenzyme of CBS and CTH. Several H2S donors with potential therapeutic applications in cardiovascular diseases have been described [64\u201366]. In our in vitro assays, we used the H2S-producing substances NaHS, DATS and DADS, GYY4137, and cysteine. GYY4137 is a water-soluble synthetic H2S donor [67,68]. The main advantage of GYY4137 over NaHS is the significantly slower H2S-releasing process. Whereas H2S release by GYY4137 peaks after 6\u201310 min, the H2S release by NaHS peaks already within 5\u20138 s. This more gradual increase in concentration corresponds more closely to conditions in vivo [68]. Low H2S concentrations that persist for a relatively long period are more comparable to the physiological milieu in vivo and have no cytotoxic effect. On the other hand, high H2S concentrations peaking in a short time period correspond to pathological conditions that lead to the activation of specific signal pathways and thus to cell death [68]. DATS and especially DADS also release H2S at a lower rate than NaHS [69]. H2S production\nToxins 2023, 15, 198 11 of 21\nby DADS and DATS in tissue depends on glutathione. DADS\u2013GTH interaction generates S-allyl-glutathione and allylperthiol, which induce H2S release through GTH [70]. In our chemotaxis assay, NaHS, DADS, and cysteine had no significant effect on PMNL migration (Figure 1). In septic mice, NaHS stimulated PMNL migration to the side of infection [71]. H2S-releasing substances increase the migration of PMNLs and work as anti-inflammators and anti-oxidants. Treatment of LPS-challenged naive mice with the H2S donor NaHS enhanced neutrophil migration [72]. H2S can also reduce leukocyte adherence, leukocyte infiltration, and edema formation [53]. NaHS and DATS had no significant effect on PMNL phagocytosis of E. coli bacteria (Figure 2). Cleasson et al. [73] reported that phagocytosis of Streptococcus agalactiae was only slightly affected by the presence of sulfide. NaHS increased the PMA- and E.coli-stimulated oxidative burst. Therefore, NaHS primes PMNLs for the production of ROS activated by PMA and E. coli (Figure 3). Whereas priming of PMNLs is an important physiologic mechanism in regulating the immune defense [74], excessive PMNL priming results in inflammation and oxidative stress [75]. DATS and cysteine significantly decreased the oxidative burst of PMNLs stimulated by E. coli (Figure 4). The observation that both substances do not interfere with the direct activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by PMA but inhibit the receptor-mediated stimulation of the oxidative burst by E. coli suggests that H2S released by DATS and cysteine interferes with signaling upstream of PKC. Anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of DADS and DATS have been described. In epithelial cells, DADS reduces inflammation by inhibiting ROS production and NF-\u03baB activation [76]. In a mice model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury, H2S released by the H2S donor GYY4137 led to reduced migration of PMNL and an impaired ROS production [77]. The synchronized elimination of activated PMNLs by apoptotic cell death is essential for the termination of inflammation [78]. A complex system of intracellular signaling pathways mediates PMNL death and is controlled by various extracellular stimuli, e.g., proinflammatory cytokines [79]. We found that NaHS, DADS, and cysteine reduced PMNL apoptosis, but GYY4137 had an apoptosis-enhancing effect (Figure 5). A difference in the kinetics of H2S formation might explain the differences in effects on apoptosis. Consistent with our results, Rinaldi et al. reported that H2S produced by NaHS attenuated PMNL apoptotic cell death and that this effect is due to inhibition of p38 MAPK and caspase 3 [80]. Shigemi et al. reported that DATS-mediated suppression of NF-\u03baB signaling leads to induction of apoptosis [81]. However, the effect of allyl derivatives on apoptosis is controversial. Several studies found that DADS and DATS induce apoptosis [82\u201385]. On the other hand, studies on cardiomyocytes indicate an anti-apoptotic effect of DATS [86,87]. In agreement with the literature reporting that p38 MAPK mediates PMNL survival [22\u201325], we found that the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 accelerated PMNL apoptosis (Figure 6A,B). The p38 MAPK inhibitor did not significantly affect the apoptosisattenuating effect of cysteine, suggesting that H2S synthesized from cysteine targets signaling downstream of p38. SB203580 had an additive effect on GYY4137-induced apoptosis (Figure 6A,B). Additive effects indicate different downstream signaling [26\u201328,88,89], suggesting that GYY4137-triggered apoptosis is independent of the p38 MAPK pathway. Inhibition of ERK by PD98059 did not change PMNL apoptosis or the effects of GYY4137 and cysteine (Figure 6C,D). Results in the literature on the role of ERK in apoptotic pathways are not consistent, reporting both pro- and anti-apoptotic properties of ERK [90\u201392]. Whereas inhibition of caspase 8 had no effect on PMNL apoptosis, the caspase 9 inhibitor had an attenuating effect (Figure 7), showing a contribution of the intrinsic pathway. In a review article, Webb et al. described that spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis is independent of Fas ligation but is mediated by caspases 8 and 9 [93]. Caspase 9 inhibition abolished the GYY4137 effect (Figure 7C,D), indicating that the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is mostly involved in GYY4137-induced PMNL apoptosis. At the moment, we do not have a satisfactory explanation for the unexpected finding that the caspase 9 inhibitor showed a much stronger effect in the presence of GYY4137 than alone. Caspase 9 inhibition had\nToxins 2023, 15, 198 12 of 21\nan additive influence on the inhibitory effect of cysteine, suggesting different signaling pathways (Figure 7). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced PMNL viability (Figure 8A,B), consistent with the reported involvement of PI3K in anti-apoptotic signaling pathways [29]. Several growthfactor and survival-factor receptors activate PI3K [94,95]. Stimulated by second messengers, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 phosphorylates protein kinase B, resulting in activation of NF-\u03baB and transcription of anti-apoptotic genes [96]. The PI3K inhibitor did not affect either the apoptosis-enhancing effect of GYY4137 or the apoptosis-attenuating effect of cysteine (Figure 8), suggesting that both substances target signaling downstream of PI3K. Consistent with the pro-survival, pro-inflammatory effect of NF-\u03baB, we showed that the inhibitor SN50 increased PMNL apoptosis (Figure 8C,D). H2S is an endogenous inflammatory mediator by increasing the activity of NF-\u03baB [48,53,97]. H2S produced by CSE stimulates DNA binding and gene activation of NF-\u03baB. Its anti-apoptotic transcriptional activity is caused by sulfhydration of NF-\u03baB [98]. A wide range of H2S in vivo concentrations has been reported in the literature: 8 \u00b5M [13], 38 \u00b5M [99], 34 \u00b5M [100], 46 \u00b5M [101], and 274 \u00b5M [102] have been measured. In in vitro experiments using H2S-donors, the volatility of H2S has to be considered. H2S volatilization is so fast that the applied H2S concentration is not reached. The loss of H2S produced from Na2S crystals is rapid and exponential, with half-times of 5 min [103,104]. In cumulative H2S dose\u2013response studies on mouse aortas, only 9% of the expected value was measured [105]. Exogenous sulfide is rapidly removed from blood, plasma, or 5% bovine serum albumin in vitro. When sulfide was added to whole blood, the measured peak concentration typically did not exceed 20% of that added [106]. Sulfide consumption increased with increasing BSA concentrations [106]. Therefore, both time and protein concentration are of the greatest importance for the concentration of available H2S in biological samples [107]. It should be noted that samples were taken from healthy subjects for our study. We used whole blood for the phagocytosis and oxidative burst assays. As a result, we increased the current H2S concentration but observed effects without the interference by the uremic milieu. On the other hand, we used isolated PMNLs for the chemotaxis and apoptosis tests. Therefore, the cells were only exposed to the H2S released by the added substances. Furthermore, PMNLs from healthy subjects have not been exposed to uremic toxins, which pre-activate immune cells while impairing their ability to respond to stimuli. It has been shown that PMNLs from healthy subjects react differently to uremic toxins than PMNLs from CKD patients [108,109]. Mononuclear cells from CKD patients have a significantly decreased cytokine production when exposed to lipopolysaccharide [110] and a diminished proliferative response to antigens in vitro [111]. One limitation of this study is that we only determined the concentration of releasing substances based on the literature and did not measure the amount of H2S generated during experiments."

NaHS, DADS, and cysteine reduced PMNL apoptosis, while GYY4137 had the opposite effect. Experiments with signal transduction inhibitor suggest that the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is mainly involved in GYY4137-induced PMNL apoptosis.
