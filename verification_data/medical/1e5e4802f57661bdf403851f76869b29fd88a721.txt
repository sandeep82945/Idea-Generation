"The results underscore that both life satisfaction and school satisfaction decline during secondary school, supporting the Stage-Environment-Fit model (Eccles et al., 1993). The results further highlight that the developmental shape of school satisfaction differed from life satisfaction, which is rather in line with a bottom-up perspective of life satisfaction (Diener, 1984). Particularly, the decline in life satisfaction is associated with achievement composition, underscoring the relevance of achievement performance in secondary school environments for the development of life satisfaction, which is in line with the Stage-Environment-Fit model and the Big-Fish-Little-Pond effect. Taken together, these findings emphasize the difference between the developmental shapes of global and domain-specific subjective well-being and their longitudinal context sensitivity."
