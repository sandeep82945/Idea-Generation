Background: Healthcare workers make up one of the occupations in the United States that experience the most musculoskeletal injuries. These injuries are often related to the movement and repositioning of patients. Despite previous injury prevention attempts, injury rates remain at an unsustainable level. The purpose of this proof-of-concept study is to provide preliminary testing of the impact of a lifting intervention on common biomechanical risk factors for injury during high-risk patient movements. ; Methods: A before-and-after (quasi-experimental) design was utilized to compare biomechanical risk factors before and after a lifting intervention. Kinematic data were collected using the Xsens motion capture system, while muscle activations were collected with the Delsys Trigno EMG system. Results: Improvements were noted in the lever arm distance, trunk velocity, and muscle activations during the movements following the intervention; Conclusions: The contextual lifting intervention shows a positive impact on the biomechanical risk factors for musculoskeletal injury among healthcare workers without increasing the biomechanical risk. A larger, prospective study is needed to determine the interventionâ€™s ability to reduce injuries among 1. conclusions Based on the findings of this proof-of-concept study, the lifting intervention demonstrated improvements in the lever arm distance, trunk velocity, and activation of the core stabilization muscles while not increasing the risk of injury related to poor body mechanics. This gives promise to the safety of testing this intervention towards injury prevention among healthcare workers. Work needs to continue to strengthen the rear deltoids and latissimus dorsi of the workers to further reduce the strain of the movements on them.
