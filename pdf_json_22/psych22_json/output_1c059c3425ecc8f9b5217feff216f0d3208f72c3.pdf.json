Identifying appropriate healthcare services necessitates investigating the mental health challenges and needs of correctional workers (CWs).\nMethods: Individual interviews (n = 9; 5M and 4W) and a mixed gender focus group (n = 6; 3M and 3W) were conducted to gather a general sense of the mental health landscape. Data were analyzed to develop a targeted and comprehensive question guide for gender-specific focus groups (n = 14 unique participants; 6M and 8 W).\nResults: Eight themes emerged from the gender-specific focus groups. Themes focusing on work culture described the negative repercussions of job stress and the inability to discuss challenges openly due to confidentiality concerns and feelings of seclusion associated with the CW profession. Men weremore likely to be subjected to physical violence and women to emotional and sexual harassment from sta and inmates. Themes related to mental health care described the benefits and limitations of the current services and digital mental healthcare. Stigma and accessibility were notable treatment barriers. Lastly, sector-specific therapy was seen as an important component in enhancing engagement and therapist interaction.\nConclusion: The study demonstrates the interconnection between work culture and CW mental health that needs to be acknowledged when addressing mental health care.\nKEYWORDS\ncorrectional workers, internet, mental health, online, psychotherapy, public safety personnel, mental health disorders\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Correctional workers (CWs) are public safety personnel (PSP) responsible for the security, safety, and provision of services for staff and inmates within prisons, jails, courthouses, and correctional centers (1). CWs often report highly stressful work conditions and frequent exposure to potentially psychological traumatic events (2). The demanding nature of this profession may partly explain why the risk of suicide and mental health disturbances is typically greater in CWs than in the general population (1, 2). In a survey of correctional service employees in Ontario, Canada (n= 1,487), 59% of correctional officers met the diagnostic criteria for one or more mental health disorders (3). Furthermore, women were significantly more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders than men (3). The repercussions of untreated occupational stress and mental health concerns can also impact physical health and interpersonal relationships and increase familial anger, stress, and strain (4).\nAlthough different stressors can contribute to the overall risk of mental disorders in CWs, the genesis of specific mental disturbances seems to stem from various aspects of the work environment. Commonly reported contributors include safety concerns, physical assaults and verbal threats, bullying and harassment, witnessing murder or suicide attempts, and dealing with constrained work conditions such as high workload, understaffing, and overcrowding (1\u20136). The amalgamation of these stressors can contribute to CW distress and mental un-wellness, which can lead to suicidal thoughts and behaviors (7). In a systematic review of mental disorders amongst CWs, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was strongly associated with physical violence and work injury (1). Major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorder were strongly associated with low perceived administrative support, job satisfaction, and perceived social value of the work role (1). In a recent qualitative study, the cultural norms of discouraging behaviors or reactions that may be perceived as weak or emotional may also contribute to the high prevalence of mental health disorders in CWs (8). Many CWs also find that there is limited mental health support (9). Moreover, systematic and individual factors such as stigma, repercussions at work, and understaffing are reported barriers to treatment-seeking (10). How these factors are associated with specific mental health disorders and treatment-seeking requires further exploration.\nThe lived experiences of CWs can provide rich and detailed insights into the dynamics of the mental health and treatment-seeking challenges they face in their work environment. The current study is the first phase of a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will investigate the efficacy of online psychotherapy in this population (11). The virtual platform (Online Psychotherapy Tool; OPTT) offers electronic cognitive behavioral therapy (e-CBT), the first-line psychotherapeutic treatment for many mental health disorders\n(12\u201314). The current study explored CWs\u2019 personal experiences with their mental health concerns and care delivery. Indepth 1:1 interviews and focus groups focused on how CWs interacted with prisoners and colleagues, their work conditions and conflicts, mental health challenges they faced, perceptions of mental health resources and support, and their attitudes toward mental health care. Participants were also asked to provide feedback on previous modules for PTSD and depression available on OPTT (11, 15). The findings of the current study will guide the development and evaluation of e-CBT programs for CWs in the subsequent phases."

Telephone screening was conducted by a trained research assistant (RA) to confirm eligibility. The RA explained the study to participants (n = 21; 10 men and 11 women), answered any questions, and obtained informed consent to participate in interviews and focus groups. The study used individual interviews and five successive focus groups. The interviews were \u223c60min in length and the focus groups were 90\u2013120min. All open-ended question guides were pilot tested before use. The focus group sample sizes were between 3 and 6 participants to create an intimate setting for experiences to be shared in depth (16). All interviews were conducted via a secure online video platform and participants were given the option to turn their webcams on or off to preserve their anonymity. Prior to commencing the interviews and focus groups, the participants were informed that they could leave at any time, that they did not need to answer all the questions, and that this was a confidential conversation.

One male participant had to leave within the first half-hour of MFG1 and agreed to join MFG2. Data from his participation in both focus groups were analyzed. The question guide comprised five open-ended questions and additional probes exploring participants\u2019 thoughts and opinions on the previously generated themes and how therapy could address them, strategies to make therapy more easily available to CWs, and general opinions of a CW-specific module that would be available on the OPTT platform. Participants were also asked to discuss how their gender impacted their work experience and how therapy could be designed to address gender-specific needs. The focus groups were conducted by a postdoctoral fellow and three RAs.\nThe screen-recorded sessions were transcribed verbatim by the postdoctoral fellow conducting the focus groups and the resulting transcripts were proofread by an RA involved in the focus groups.

Textual data from the individual interviews and mixed-gender focus groups were analyzed using systematic text condensation, informed by Giorgi\u2019s psychological phenomenological analysis methods (22). This descriptive and exploratory method is frequently used for thematic cross-case analysis of different types of qualitative data to uncover meaning behind a person\u2019s experience (22). The themes centered around the lived experiences of CWs with their mental health and how it may have been impacted by their profession. The data were analyzed by a co-author (YK), a clinician-scientist with experience in qualitative analysis methods. The emergent themes were presented to the research team for discussion and finalization.\nData from the gender-specific focus groups were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis (23) by the postdoctoral fellow and RA who conducted the interviews. Thematic analysis was conducted (24). Initially, the transcribed screen recordings from each focus group were uploaded onto NVivo 12 (25), and open codes were generated that captured prevalent ideas amongst CWs. These codes were then organized into primary, secondary, and tertiary categories, and a codebook of themes was generated. With the analysis of each subsequent focus group, the codebook was modified and revised to capture new insights generated. The themes were then discussed amongst the research team and revised where necessary."

CWs were aware that enclosing individuals in a confined space would result in a natural restlessness. However, what distinguished correctional work from other PSP sectors was:\nWhere we work, there\u2019s no place to go. If there\u2019s an incident, you stay where you are, and the perpetrator goes out to the hospital and comes back to the same unit and you have to deal with the same guy that you had issues with. Paramedics will get to an incident and they won\u2019t see them again, ever, the people that they fix. People that we try to fix, we see them again and again and again. Some of them for ten, fifteen, 20 years (PM4)\nSubtheme: Multiple roles at work\nThe work environment expected CWs to assume different roles, even if they were not trained in that area: \u201csometimes I\nget a feeling that our role has merged into semi-counselors but without all the education,\u201d (PW12). Another participant stated that there\u2019s \u201cnot enough support given to perform tasks outside of your job description. That is definitely something that has frustrated me\u201d (PM1). Many CWs described the general work as monotonous and that wearing multiple hats usually occurred during incidents:\nYou have your routine, your feed, you do your meds, walks, regular things over and over and over again and that gets really monotonous and tedious. But then when something does happen, you become all of the above. You are the fire department, you are the paramedic, you\u2019re the social worker, you\u2019re the police officer. You have all these different hats that you may be required to wear at any given time throughout your day or your week. So I think that can become a little strenuous, having to be everything all at once. (PM3)\nSubtheme: Relationship with management\nParticipants described having different experiences with different managers: \u201cI\u2019ve had some managers that are really supportive and really great and I\u2019ve had others that are absolutely horrible\u201d (PW13). Another participant described differences in the level of management: \u201csome people that work in senior management have never worked in a day in the life of a correctional officer\u201d (PW14). One of the criticisms was that during incidents, staff mental well-being was not prioritized:\nIf there\u2019s an incident that happens, the first thing you hear is to make sure to cross your T\u2019s and dot your I\u2019s instead of, how are you guys doing? Did you guys survive that swing or [the offender] trying to kill you? Or did you make sure that your documentation is right? (PM4)\nMental health views were reported to differ amongst managers and staff who had been in service for a longer period of time: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a manager that might be coming around 30 years, in my firsthand experience, I hear that mental health isn\u2019t really pushed. It\u2019s kind of like an old guard mentality with that person,\u201d (PF16). Mental health services promoted by management also seemed disingenuous: \u201cit\u2019s kind of like they do it because they have to do it, not because they want to do it\u201d (PM3). These feelings may be due to a lack of perceived care and concern: \u201cThey put up all the posters but I\u2019ve never had a manager stop me and ask me actually how I\u2019m doing\u201d (PM2). CWs also indicated a disconnect between management and the frontline: \u201cthere was no meaningful dialogue which again adds to that frustration\u201d (PM5)."

The negative effects also extended to other areas of a person\u2019s life: \u201cI love what I do. . .However, it\u2019s taken its toll personally, professionally, with relationships, with mental health. It\u2019s taken its toll in so many ways,\u201d (PW16). Emotional detachment was seen as a way to cope with traumatic experiences and burnout: \u201cit\u2019s a quiet survival mechanism\u201d (PM5). Another participant found that positive behaviors outside of the work environment were not beneficial and resulted in emotional detachment at work:\nI\u2019m a very caring, courteous, polite person and I tried to maintain that inside of that environment. That creates a lot of emotional labor because it\u2019s very difficult for me and was sort of the cause of my mental injury, that conflicting emotion in there.

One participant reported that \u201ca bravado exists amongst both sexes or genders\u201d (PM2). This culture was also described as one frequently practiced by the older generation of CWs with an influence on younger employees:\nThey [new officers] see or they hear about these older officers and how they act in this sort of macho environment way, this toxic masculinity way, and they try to act in that way too to fit in. And I think that\u2019s a big issue. (PW13)\nA fear of judgement was listed as a reason why CWs\nrefrained from addressing mental health needs:\nI find with trying to access all of that stuff is the fear that someone that you know, [who] is one of those stereotypical macho guards will literally call you out for it and make you feel like garbage because you need help when you know that they\u2019re almost as broken, if not more broken than you are. Just the fa\u00e7ade is very intimidating. (PW12)\nSubtheme: Disconnect between work and personal life\nMost CWs found a disconnect between their identities inside\nand outside work:\nWhen you leave the gate, leave the institution, you turn the [correctional worker] off a little bit and then you turn into the husband, or the father, or the friend, or whatever role you\u2019re going to have that you name on your rest days. It\u2019s a little bit of a disconnect. (PM3)\nSome participants also expressed that it was hard to disconnect from work and that it had an impact on their personal life:\nI was always on the edge. We\u2019re always in a state of readiness, right?...This is why when you see a lot of the guys going to the restaurants, they always have their back to the wall. Because you always have that state of readiness. (PM6)\nMany CWs also reported that control was necessary at work\nbut became problematic in their personal lives:\nEvery aspect of somebody\u2019s [offender] life is controlled by us in some regard. . . it\u2019s hard for us to lose control. . . I know when I go home and my wife and I argue or bicker about something, it\u2019s very hard for me sometimes to relinquish that control because I\u2019m so used to having it. (PM2)\nMany of the participants found that those outside corrections did not understand the nature of their job: \u201cthey [friends and family] don\u2019t get that your job is literally so stressful that your anxiety levels are at 100 most of the time,\u201d (PW12). Some CWs described the public as being in the dark regarding the details of the CW profession, making it hard for them to share their work experiences:\nPeople who are not in corrections don\u2019t understand what life is like inside and so it\u2019s hard to be able to share any of that experience or for them just to have a basic understanding of what everyday life is like there. (PW11)\nThe inability to confide in family members was reported to be guilt-inducing: \u201cI carry a lot of guilt, you know opening up to my family about things like that because I don\u2019t want to traumatize them and vicarious trauma is a real thing,\u201d (PW16). Feelings of isolation and exclusion were also apparent in the participants:\n[We\u2019re] behind the wall, nobody really knows about us, nobody really has talked to us, we haven\u2019t really been included in a lot of things. If they talk about a law enforcement day, correctional officers are rarely included. We\u2019re typically excluded from most things. (PM2)"

You\u2019re getting disgusting comments from your coworkers and from the inmates. It\u2019s a different culture because you\u2019re a female and you\u2019re weak. It\u2019s that whole thing of females in roles that are traditionally male. It\u2019s another one of those crappy parts of the job.

Even myself, it took me years to step up. And I knew I was having issues but I was just like, \u2018I can get through it, I can get through.\u2019 And finally, I wasn\u2019t. I broke down. (PM6)\nBecause some interventions were offered in a public environment, it prevented some CWs from accepting them: \u201cthe sad thing is because they offer it in a public environment, everybody\u2019s gonna decline or most people are gonna decline\neven if they might not have declined in another situation,\u201d (PF4). Stigma contributed to a fear of judgement within the workplace culture, which discouraged CWs from receiving care. When the idea of an onsite mental health care office emerged, one participant expressed:\nThe stigma is still there and as much as we want to say that it\u2019s not or it\u2019s changing, I think that some people will still have that fear, like \u2018ok, I\u2019m going to go there [onsite office for mental health care], what are my people going to think?\u2019 (PF14)\nOne participant described the fear of work repercussions\nwhich prevented CWs from seeking help:\nA lot of people worry that you\u2019re gonna be labeled with something, that you\u2019re gonna go and talk to somebody and then a doctor is going to recommend that you take some time off. . . and while you\u2019re off, people at work are gonna be seeing you taking time off, not dealing with what they\u2019re dealing with. . . and the stigma of waiting and getting yourself right while they [coworkers] have to deal with it [mental health challenges] is what\u2019s really difficult for a lot of people to seek help. (PM2)\nNormalizing mental health and addressing the \u201cmacho culture\u201d (PF10)was seen as an important way of reducing stigma, \u201cI don\u2019t know howwe can do it, but I think we need to normalize mental health as much as we do physical health. . .we need to help staff realize that mental health problems are still health problems,\u201d (PF4). Some CWs were hopeful that the younger generation will contribute to greater awareness and changes in workplace mental health stigma:\nI know officers who have said, \u2018I\u2019m broken and I\u2019m getting help for this and I\u2019m doing whatever treatment or therapy,\u2019 and they speak openly about [it] and that gives me hope for a new generation and a new future for corrections.

One of the benefits of individual therapy was that there was no judgement: \u201cYou just feel like you can say what you need to say without judgement\u201d (PF14). Another participant who preferred individual therapy said: \u201cit\u2019s really hard as a [CW] to open up in front of a group of people. . . It\u2019s one thing to do it [with] other staff. . . It is way harder to do it in front of people that you know,\u201d (PM2). At the same time, confidential group therapies were also viewed positively: \u201c[CWs] can get together and have those discussions in a form that\u2019s safe and shared by everyone\u201d (PF11). Another participant indicated that sharing experiences can be \u201ckind of an education\u201d (PM6). The majority of participants believed that individual therapy could be the first line of treatment, followed by group therapy:\nI think I\u2019d like individual [therapy] maybe initially. [Then] I think developing a support group of peers who literally are going through the exact same thing, or very similar anyway. A one-on-one with someone who hasmaybe a more psychotherapy background can provide actionable tools. (PF10)\nParticipants had variable opinions on online and in-person therapy. Most preferred in-person delivery and felt they would be more committed to it because \u201cnot everyone has the time or the structure in their life to necessarily do things online. . . not everybody\u2019s self-driven\u201d (PF4). Some attributed their preference for in-person delivery to the social nature of their work: \u201cmy interactions with people are always face-to-face with eye contact and I find that is an important part of relaying your proper mental state - is to be able to look at somebody and say that\u201d (PM1). Some participants also described the impersonal aspect of the online delivery method: \u201cthere\u2019s kind of a little bit of a disconnect when you do something over zoom, or teams, or via phone. There\u2019s that lack of personal aspect to it,\u201d (PM3). In contrast to most CWs, one participant described the benefit of writing things down in online therapy: \u201cI know I feel like I have a hard time articulating frommy head to verbally. So sometimes I write it down and reassess it, just to get a clear picture of what I\u2019m trying to say,\u201d (PF14). Having therapy that acknowledged CWs\u2019 experiences was also a way to make them feel cared for: \u201cI think having firsthand knowledge and experiences integrated into the therapy makes it feel like they give a shit about what we have to say and about how we want to make it better for the next person\u201d (PF16).\nLastly, the majority of CWs expressed the importance of working with therapists who had a strong background in corrections: \u201cwe should have therapists who know what our work environment is and the baggage that you can\ntake from there into your everyday life\u201d (PF4). One of the reasons experienced therapists were necessary was because: \u201cthey [therapists without correctional experience] really can\u2019t empathize with us very well. They understand trauma, I believe, or they understand trauma from their point of view, but it\u2019s not perhaps the same trauma that we go through\u201d (PM2). Working with experienced therapists was also viewed as a way to enhance treatment-seeking: \u201cif I knew right away that I was going to talk to so had a background in it [corrections] rather than just somebody from the street, I would be personally more inclined to call\u201d (PM2).\nTheme: Online CW-specific psychotherapy modules"

Some weeks maybe I\u2019d sit there and do the whole thing and the other ones maybe I\u2019d do it over a couple of days. (PM5)\nThe time flexibility of the platform was also appealing to a participant who was unable to concentrate for long periods of time due to his mental health injury. However, concentrating on a screen was challenging for another participant: \u201cit\u2019s just the fact that I have to sit there and concentrate on a screen instead of just talking with someone. And I have difficulty concentrating, so that\u2019s my issue\u201d (PM6). The accessibility of the therapy was also a positive feature for some CWs:\nIt sounds like it would work. It would allow people to access mental health care from their homes, which would be a little bit more comfortable for them if they\u2019re having a hard time with the social aspect of life. (PM1)\nAnother CW also acknowledged the program\u2019s broad reach: \u201clet\u2019s say, 15% are going to do it, that\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019ve reached that 15% that you wouldn\u2019t before\u201d (PM3). One participant summarized the advantages and disadvantages as follows:\nSo advantages, definitely would be, it\u2019s online, if you have an internet connection, you can access it. You can go back and review the material. You can kind of do it at your own pace, kind of like an online course sort of thing. . . But I think the disadvantage is if someone is pretty far into a spiral of their mental health, they may not want to take the time out of their day [or] give a crap in general. They may not understand what the material means, or they might be an older person that\u2019s not\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 10 frontiersin.org\ncomputer savvy or things like that, that might need more traditional talk therapy or go in-person or something like that (PF16)\nFor some, the exercise due dates had drawbacks:\nSome people do very well with a due date and other people would really struggle with it and I know I\u2019d really struggle if it was like, \u2018here\u2019s your PowerPoint, you have to check through and do the homework and click on it and send it back,\u2019 and one week you\u2019d get great work from me and the next week you\u2019d get pretty rough work from me.

The negative aspect of the program described by someCWswas that it seemed to resemble other online training programs:\nEverything in our training now these days is online. And most people don\u2019t even read through it. It\u2019s just a matter of going through it and then checking. It\u2019s just a checkmark and so I think another online format, would be another issue I think.

Whereas, if I sat down and talked to somebody in person, it\u2019s a much different scenario\u201d (PM2). A suggestion largely expressed by CWs was the inclusion of relevant examples within the therapy modules designed for CWs: \u201creal-life videos of not necessarily actors, but maybe people going through certain situations and talking about certain situations can help,\u201d (PF4). The cartoonish examples in the modules were pointed out by two participants. One participant expressed:\n[If cartoonish images are used in modules designed for CWs] They don\u2019t feel real. They\u2019re kind of cartoony, but then we experience that a lot. . . it\u2019s insulting. Give me a picture of a real person who looks like they\u2019re going through distress rather than a cartoonish or screenshotted image of somebody. (PF4)\nAnother participant added:\nI do know that most of the training that I did, was all cartoons. There would be some videos that would have definite correctional workers in them and actors, which were funny. But a lot of them, I find that the more serious things tend to be animated. (PF12)\nWhen asked if they would prefer real-life examples with CWs integrated into the modules, one CW responded: \u201cI would definitely be more apt to take it if I knew there was information in it from coworkers or other people who have been in corrections,\u201d (PF12)."

Another participant outlined the difference between online and in-person therapy: \u201cEven if it\u2019s got great pictures, great stories, great videos to play, I never take the same thing out of it than if someone face-to-face teaches me the information\u201d (PM2).However, the benefits of the virtual therapist were expressed, even if there was an impersonal aspect to it:\nI can see how it can feel really impersonal because it\u2019s a pre-recorded set of slides but the feedback that you get from your individual therapists, I think is what will make it better for anyone who participates in this. (PF4)\nOne participant suggested adding a virtual face-to-face\ntherapist instead of solely communicating through text:\nI can do it [the therapy] on my phone or my laptop or whatever and it gives a little bit more freedom even to go back to the material and read it over again.

Another participant included, \u201cI agree with that, or perhaps for the initial assessment and goals, [it] would be helpful to have an in-person call,\u201d (PF11).

(PF14)\nProviding homework feedback during virtual meetings\ninstead of textual content was also expressed:\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 11 frontiersin.org\nI think for a response, even a 15min [meeting]. Because you\u2019re basically just going to try to convey what you would normally write in that paragraph you sent back.

(PM3)\nThese strategies were seen as good ways to develop a good\ntherapeutic relationship:\nI really like having an idea of who you\u2019re talking to and knowing that you\u2019re talking to a person and not just a computer and that you can develop a therapeutic relationship.

            "heading": "Work culture",
            "text": "In line with the current body of research (6), correctional work culture was described as one marked by high stress,\ntrauma, and violence. The findings support role overload as having a large effect on job stress (26). The pervasiveness of job stress was also reported to stem from role boredom and monotony. Hypervigilance, a dominant trait in CWs (27), can be a result of the interaction between monotonous correctional work and chronic trauma exposure (28). The current study provides a novel perspective that inadequate preparation stemming from the multiple roles that CWs take on can worsen sentiment toward workplace monotony. The stress of separating work and personal life identities may also add to the significant work-life conflict observed in CWs (29\u201331). As a result, detachment and decompressing behaviors were frequently reported by participants. In British prison officers, those who successfully detached themselves from work-related challenges were more likely to have a good work-life balance and experience greater psychological health (30). At the same time, ignoring the work conditions that instill these behaviors can have a pernicious effect on employee mental health and burnout risk in the long term (32, 33).\nAlthough a previous study observed no significant difference in the rate of violence experienced by male and female prison employees (34), the current findings indicate that violence type may be influenced by gender. The experiences of women CWs are in line with concerns of gender inequality and sexism that appear in this male-dominated profession (35). These factors may partly explain why all the women in the study kept their webcams off while all the men kept theirs on. Threats to identity safety may result in women being less vocal in expressing their concerns without anonymity (36, 37). It may have also contributed to the negative views some women CWs expressed toward members of their own gender. At the same time, workplace harassment training programs were not viewed as effective by participants. Similarly, a recent study also demonstrated the ineffectiveness of these training programs (38). Paradoxically, these training programs have been shown to increase the likelihood of victim blaming amongst men due to a defensive reaction (38). In line with the current findings, the study authors suggested manager and leadership training to help detect and de-escalate early signs of harassment. Working with employees to develop actionable tools and strategies may encourage men to have a proactive role in promoting a positive work culture. In turn, this approach could potentially discourage the toxic masculinity expressed by the women CWs in the study."

            "text": "As indicated by study participants and supported by other studies (39), organizational and managerial support, mutual trust, and an opportunity to provide constructive feedback on services are effective ways to improve program efficacy and protect against the harmful mental repercussions of correctional work. Although stigma and fears of judgement\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 12 frontiersin.org\nwere expressed by study participants, many highlighted the importance of peer support and being able to talk to someone who understood their experience. Stigma is a key factor in the normalization of toxic masculinity (i.e., socially regressive male traits) and isolation, all of which can contribute to and worsen adverse mental health outcomes and discourage individuals from seeking care (40, 41). Conversely, social support is associated with lower odds of PTSD positive screens in CWs (42). Indeed, study participants described the protective effects of supportive interpersonal relationships with management, colleagues, and family.\nParticipants also advocated for sector-specific therapy. Previous research on public safety personnel indicates that sector-specific therapists can strengthen therapeutic alliance (43, 44). The findings extend on this by shedding light on the seclusion of this profession and difficulty in explaining work experiences to individuals outside of the profession, including therapists that CWs had worked with. Previous findings also demonstrate that therapists available through institution-provided programs typically lack knowledge of correctional work (45) and their services are less likely to be used for work-related reasons (46). Participants also suggested including real-life examples in therapy that they can better relate to. These examples may be a lesser but beneficial form of social support and an alternative way for CWs to feel connected while refraining from sharing information they perceive will jeopardize their standing in the workplace (47). Many hailed in-person therapy for creating a more personable experience and enabling strong therapeutic connections. Similar to previous findings (48), although participants found the online programs to be convenient, accessible, and time-flexible, many pointed out that the lack of a face-to-face therapist could make the program impersonal. Some suggested including a video component to enhance working alliance."

The triangulation of individual interviews and the focus group aimed to enhance data richness and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mental health landscape in corrections (50). In addition, exploring perceptions of digital mental health programs is a unique novelty of the current study. These insights are valuable considering that the use of digital mental health programs is gaining traction in correctional facilities (11, 43, 51). Providing a platform for CW voices can help guide clinical practice surrounding digital therapies for this population. Not only can this strengthen mutual trust and integrity (33, 52), but it can aid in developing programs that acknowledge limitations and barriers expressed by users.\nAlthough the study had many strengths, it also warrants discussing its limitations. The study participants were ethnically homogenous with the majority identifying as white. Since low racial diversity exists in correctional work (53, 54), the current sample may reflect these trends. At the same time, it is important to explore factors that may prevent BIPOC groups from sharing their mental health experiences and needs. Differential outcomes in mental health care preferences and needs of diverse racial and cultural groups (55, 56) suggest consideration of these groups in future studies. Lastly, most of the study participants had a mental health diagnosis and detailed their frustrations navigating through the current care system. Future studies may want to consider the experiences of participants who are not diagnosed or have recovered from their mental diagnoses. These individuals may provide additional perspectives on mental health challenges and services that may not have been previously considered."
