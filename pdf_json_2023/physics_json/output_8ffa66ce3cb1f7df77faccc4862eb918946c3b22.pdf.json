Based on such architectures, Qu et al. developed the preparation of a hetero[4]rotaxane containing a [c2]daisy chain via an elegant self-sorting strategy.22\nHerein we report the design and synthesis of a ditopic amide-based [2]rotaxane, a mechanized monomer that might be involved in a plethora of chemical equilibria between different mechanically-interlocked supramolecular species in solution, as represented in Fig. 1. The main particularity of this system is the presence of a diamide macrocycle linked to the habitual Leigh-type tetraamide ring by means of an aryl\u2013aryl bond, and with a thread bearing two binding sites. NMR experiments and MS data were decisive for unambiguously determining the main supramolecular structure formed in solution, a dimeric cyclic hetero[4]pseudorotaxane with a [c2] daisy chain substructure. Computational studies corroborated the formation of this cyclic pseudorotaxane by a cooperative self-assembly. Three different strategies for controlling the disassembly of this mechanically interlocked supramolecular species have been successfully achieved.\nReaction conditions: (i) N1,N3-bis[4-(aminomethyl)benzyl]isophthalamide, 5-bromoisophthaloyl dichloride, Et3N, CHCl3, 25 \u00b0C, 4 h; (ii) bis(pinacolato)diboron, Pd(dppf)Cl2 (5 mol%), AcOK, dioxane, 90 \u00b0C, 24 h."

Whereas the chemical shi of the signals ascribed to the fumaramide binding site (Hb and Hc, red) are importantly upshied to lower values (Ddaverage = 1.32 ppm),27 the corresponding signals of the GlyGly station (Hh and Hj, green) remained nearly unaffected. The signal referred to the NHd of the fumaramide is shied to higher chemical shi (Dd = 1.18 ppm), as result of the hydrogen-bonding interaction with the polyamide macrocycle (light blue). This scenario clearly points out that the macrocycle in rotaxane 2 is predominantly located over the fumaramide binding site, with the GlyGly station practically unoccupied. Interestingly, the 1H NMR spectrum recorded in CDCl3 of compound 5, with the second macrocycle attached to the rst one, was very complex (Fig. 2c).\nAer a careful inspection we could assign the most signicant signals. Apart from the new peaks corresponding to the novel diamide macrocycle (in purple) and the former tetraamide one (in light blue), the most relevant changes in the spectrum of 5 in CDCl3, when compared with that of rotaxane 2, is the displacement to lower chemical shi of the signals Hh and Hj (in green) part of the GlyGly binding site. This fact indicates that the GlyGly station is now placed inside the diamide macrocycle (in purple). The chemical shi of the signals of the fumaramide (Hb+c) are not altered when the second macrocycle is attached, thus supporting that compound 5 is probably forming the supramolecular interlocked dimer, the hetero[4]rotaxane 5$5, via the self-slippage of the GlyGly station through the second diamide ring (see Fig. 1 for\nChem.

The employment of DMSO, a highly polar solvent able to strongly compete for the establishment of hydrogen-bonding interactions,28 apparently precluded the assembly of the supramolecular aggregate 5$5 occurring in CDCl3. Thus, the formation or not of the supramolecular dimer can be controlled by selecting media of different polarity, the use of a very polar solvent such as DMSO completely precluding the assembly (Fig. 3a). The multiple possibilities in the self-assembly of the\n4146 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 4143\u20134151\nditopic compound 5 via threading of the GlyGly moiety through the diamide macrocycle made difficult the analysis of the 1H NMR spectra of 5 in CDCl3 solution. Consequently, we could not unambiguously distinguish between the presence in that solution of a monomer (linear or self-threaded), a dimer (cyclic or acyclic), trimeric species or larger assembled structures. Therefore, a MALDI-TOF experiment was performed in order to observe the formation of one or several of those stable supramolecular aggregates. Indeed, the obtained spectra showed up that compound 5 forms dimeric species in a signicant amount, whilst identifying also the monomer. The experimental isotopic distribution of the peaks corresponding to the molecular ion of the 5$5 dimer was in total agreement with the calculated ones (Fig. 4, inset). The MALDI-TOF experiment also shows the formation of traces of trimeric supramolecular structures ([3M + Na]+ 5642.5)."

As expected, the supramolecular assembly 5 showed the lowest diffusion coefficient (D = 3.68 \u00d7 10\u221210 m2 s\u22121, Table 1, entry 4). Diffusion coefficients and molecular radii are correlated by the Stokes\u2013Einstein equation.30 It has been postulated31 that the volume of a molecular species, considering a relatively spherical shape, is proportional to its molecular weight. Thus, the equation can be linearized by taking the logarithm of both magnitudes.32 We established a calibration curve with D values of amide-based rotaxanes previously described in the literature20 and that of [2]rotaxane 2, showing a good correlation (see Fig. S2, S3 and Table S1\u2020).

The respective rRot values of thread 1 (7.6 \u00c5) and [2]rotaxane 2 (8.8 \u00c5) are in fairly good agreement with their hydrodynamic radii (7.1 \u00c5 and 8.6 \u00c5, respectively) obtained from the D values (Table 1, entries 2\u20133). However, those corresponding to macrocycle 3 (8.4 \u00c5) and [4] rotaxane 5$5 (17.8 \u00c5) are far from being realistic due to the elliptical shapes shown by their computed structures. For that reason, we calculated the theoretical D values of macrocycle 3 (7.72 \u00d7 10\u221210 m2 s\u22121) and [4]rotaxane 5$5 (3.30 \u00d7 10\u221210 m2 s\u22121) considering these structures as prolates, which t well with those experimentally determined (Table 1, entries 1 and 4).36 By contrast, the hypothetical diffusion coefficient of monomeric 5 when considering an elliptical shape (5.08 \u00d7 10\u221210 m2 s\u22121) is quite far from that obtained from the NMR experiments (Table 1, entry 4). Thus, we can conclude that the experimental diffusion data are consistent with the presence of a compact and elliptical shaped [4]rotaxane 5$5 as the major species in CDCl3.\nTo further investigate a potential equilibrium between 5 and 5$5, we also determined the diffusion coefficient in CDCl3 over the range of concentrations 2\u201310 mM (see ESI, Table S2\u2020). The D-value of the supramolecular assembly 5 increases up to 10% on going from 10 mM (3.38 \u00d7 10\u221210 m2 s\u22121) to 2 mM (3.71 \u00d7 10\u221210 m2 s\u22121). However, we observed an analogous growth for the D-values of rotaxane 2, unable to self-assemble, at the same concentrations. These results seem to indicate that the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nassembly coming from 5 does not experience any change in this range of concentrations.\nFinally, we measured the diffusion coefficient of 5 in DMSOd6 where it exists as the monomer (Table 1, entry 5). In this solvent of higher viscosity, the D value of 5 is consistently smaller. However, its rH calculated from the Stokes\u2013Einstein equation turned out to be very similar to that determined in CDCl3. At rst sight, the similar hydrodynamic radii of 5 in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6, seems to contradict our previous assumptions. However, it should be taken into account that the diffusion speed is very sensitive to molecular shape and solvation effects, that can be very different in both solvents.38 Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the presence of a compact elliptical dimer 5$5 as the major species in CDCl3 and a less compact and highly solvatedmonomer 5 in DMSO-d6.\n2.4 Computational studies for the self-assembly of rotaxane 5\nIn order to nd further evidences concerning the formation of the cyclic [4]pseudorotaxane in solution, we also carried out computational studies. Aer a deep conformational study of the individual components present in system 5 (thread 1 and the unthreaded tetraamide and diamide macrocycles) by molecular mechanics (MMFF94), we calculated the potential intermolecular and intramolecular interactions that can be established when the supramolecular aggregates are formed, both in the gas phase and in solution (CHCl3), optimizing their geometries at a DFT level (BP86-D3/def2-SVP). Aer analyzing a range of the possible assemblies of 5 (i.e. molecular lasso, lineal dimers, etc.), we found that the formation of the [c2]daisy chain was the energetically most favorable structure. Moreover, the computations show that the encapsulation of the two GlyGly stations inside the cavity of the two diamide macrocycles (one of each molecule) to form the cyclic dimer 5$5 is neatly favorable via a cooperativity phenomenon.

Note that the GlyGly station in the monomer 5 is interacting with the diamide macrocycle (highlighted in purple) but not inside its cavity, thus not forming a molecular lasso (Fig. 5a). As the binding energy of 5$5 is lower than twice that of the monomer 5 we assume that some kind of cooperativity should be operating in the formation of the doubly interlocked dimer 5$5 (Fig. 5c). Thus, these computations show that the formation of the cyclic hetero[4]pseudorotaxane is favored over other supramolecular architectures of lower level of complexity. Moreover, the computed structure of 5$5 (Fig. 5b) is in accord with that deduced from the NMR experiments (Fig. 2), with the tetraamide macrocycle (in blue) located over the fumaramide binding site (in red) and the diamide ring (in purple) over the GlyGly function (in green) (see colours in Scheme 2)."

            "text": "At this point we wondered how to inhibit the self-assembly of the monomer 5. We envisaged that the formation of the cyclic dimer 5$5 could be dampened by converting the fumaramide binding site of 5 into another functionality with negligible affinity for the tetraamide macrocycle, forcing in this way the translation of this ring to the nearby GlyGly station and thus precluding its dimerization. The control of the translational motion in fumaramide-containing rotaxanes have been extensively investigated due to the versatile switchability of this function by means of isomerization by light irradiation39 or chemical transformations. The Diels\u2013Alder reaction of a diene (typically, cyclopentadiene) with the fumaramide function at the thread of a bistable rotaxane has been reported to efficiently promote the shuttling of its entwined polyamide macrocycle towards an adjacent station.40 With this precedent in mind, we carried out the Diels\u2013Alder reaction between 5 and cyclopentadiene affording the expected adduct Cp-5 in 48% yield41 as a 1 : 1 mixture of two diastereoisomers (Fig. 6). A deep analysis of the NMR spectra of Cp-5, by comparing with the spectra of similar Diels\u2013Alder adducts of the thread Cp-1 and the bromoderived rotaxane Cp-2 (see ESI\u2020 for synthetic details), allowed us to assess that Cp-5 is not a cyclic dimer (Fig. 6). The signals of the new station (bicycloheptene Diels\u2013Alder product, in orange) appears at similar chemical shis in the three adducts indicating that, in the case of the rotaxanes Cp-5 and Cp-2, there is not interaction of the new stations with the tetraamide ring. In addition, the signals due to the GlyGly function (green colour in Fig. 6) are shied to higher eld when comparing to those of the thread Cp-1 and the rotaxanes Cp-2 and Cp-5, indicating that the respective tetraamide macrocycle is in fact interacting with the GlyGly station and, as a consequence, precluding the selfassembly of the doubly interlocked structure. Moreover, the position of the macrocycle at this side of the thread is also evidenced by a drastic shielding of the signals related to the\n4148 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 4143\u20134151\nadjacent stopper (Hl and Hm). Remarkably, the retro-Diels\u2013 Alder reaction of Cp-5 under thermal and high vacuum conditions, resulted in the re-assembly of the cyclic dimer 5$5 (see ESI\u2020 for further synthetic details).\nWe were also intrigued by the possibility of using an external guest as a competitor for the occupation of the diamide macrocycle present in 5, precluding the formation of the supramolecular dimer. Pyridine N-oxide derivatives have been proven to interact with diamide macrocycles, analogous to that in 5, by forming stable pseudorotaxanes.42 Thus, we expected that the addition of the pyridine N-oxide derivative 6, with butyl groups at the ends (see ESI for further details, Fig. S17 and S18\u2020), to a solution of 5 in CDCl3 could prevent the formation of the cyclic [4]rotaxane (Fig. 7). First, we performed titration experiments by adding pyridine N-oxide 6 to a solution of the bromo-\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Next, we proved that the addition of up to 18 equiv. of 6 to a solution of 5 (2 mM, CDCl3, 298 K) was necessary for avoiding the formation of the supramolecular dimer as result of the putative assembly of the new pseudorotaxane 5$6. Having in mind that the association constant between the macrocycle 3 and the N-oxide 6 was same order of that of 3 with thread 1 (518 M\u22121 vs. 418 M\u22121), the disassembly of the dimer 5$5 required an excess of N-oxide 6 for totally disrupting the formation of the supramolecular dimer. In this regard, it must be also considered that this process is even made more difficult by the cooperativity phenomenon behind the assembly of 5$5."

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nthis system for self-assembly has been deeply studied by experimental and computational techniques. Solutions of the complementary rotaxane in a noncompetitive solvent allows the hydrogen-bonding-driven assembly of a novel cyclic hetero[4] pseudorotaxane, with a [c2]daisy chain substructure. The survival of this supramolecular architecture has been proven by NMR and MS analysis, and also by computational methods, supporting the positive cooperativity phenomenon that assists its assembly. Remarkably, the controlled disassembly of the supramolecular architecture can be achieved by different methods, such as increasing the polarity of the solvent, by addition of a competitive organic molecule and by performing a reversible chemical transformation that induces an internal translational movement of the ring along the thread. All these methods reduce the level of association of the systems up to the monomer. The synthetic methodology shown here might be used in the preparation of other mechanically interlocked systems displaying intricated structures and enabled for switching functions."
