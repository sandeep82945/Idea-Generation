Introduction\nThe optoelectronic devices have been tremendously studied in order to upgrade and develop their properties. For the same reason, it has been attempted to find materials that could be used as active layers in these optoelectronic devices. The new generation of the components is highly valued because they are based on organic materials that offer not only flexibility and lightweight but also large surface and potentially low-cost devices [1]. Conjugated polymers are considered as one of the most successful and promising materials to be used as active layers in organic optoelectronic devices, such as in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic solar cells (OSCs) [2\u20134]. A deeper understanding of the structure-properties correlation is required as the main purpose of our study. In order to attain the objective, theoretical calculations based on DFT are employed to design and to model a new copolymer derived by Poly(2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene)(MEH-PPV) combined with the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The choice of these polymers is based on their close optoelectronic properties and their conductor characters, where their electrical conductivities are equal to 8.8 \u00d7 10\u22128 S/m and 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 S/cm, respectively, for MEH-PPV [5] and P3HT [6]. Also, these two polymers are the most tested in organic electronics. Hence, the testing combination of the two polymers leads to a new copolymer with optimal properties of the two basic homopolymers. The interesting photoconductive properties, such as the capacity of absorbance in the visible, the low gap, and the high charge transport, are features that make these polymers mostly used in the optoelectronic fields [7\u20139]. Similar simulations with DFT were performed to evaluate the different properties of some conjugated polymers and also to determine the effects of the charge transfer in the donor-acceptor systems for an organic solar cell. As examples, we can note the study\nPolymers 2022, 14, 513. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14030513 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 513 2 of 20\ndeveloped by Peng Song\u2019s team, which is based on the investigation of the photoinduced charge transfer in the (P3HT: PCBM) systems and their effects on the photophysical properties [10]. For the same system, Liu\u2019s group [11] and Debkumar\u2019s team [12] made a detailed theoretical study that describes the structure and the optoelectronic parameters of the different oligomers, which are indicated that the variation of the energy depends on the number of monomeric in each oligomer. Moreover, Mamduh J. Aljaafreh et al. investigated the theoretical optoelectronic properties of an optimized structure of a copolymer that is based on MEH-PPVB and compared the obtained results with the experimental [13]. The new copolymer MEH-PPV-P3HT has not been synthesized, so our strategy is to study the properties derived from the combination of MEH-PPV and P3HT and to deeply describe their optoelectronic properties. In this way, this study can be helpful to better understand the relationship between the structure and the properties of the results copolymer and their application as an active layer of solar cells. For more insights into the effects of the coupling on the conformational, optoelectronic, and vibrational parameters, the modeling of these polymers should be carried out.\n2. Computational Details\nThe structures of the basic homopolymers and their derived copolymers were modeled using the density functional theory (DFT) [14,15]. The geometric optimization was carried out using the functional hybrid B3LYP method [16\u201318] and the base set 6-31G (d, p) [19]. The vibrational and the electronic properties, such as HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energetic levels, were calculated by the same method. To determine the coupling sites between the monomers, an oxidized optimization was performed to evaluate the spin density values in each monomer. These latter represent the electronic density distribution in the cation radical from the oneelectron (+1) charged [20\u201322]. Afterward, the optical absorption spectra were simulated by two different methods, which are time dependant-DFT [19] using the same base set, but the functional hybrid was CAM-B3LYP [23\u201325] and ZINDO. These methods are also used to model the photoluminescence spectra, which were obtained by a re\u2013optimization using the CIS method [26] with an STO-3G base set. The simulation of these optical spectra considers the presence of chloroform solvent. Furthermore, for the excited state, the electronic transition assignments and oscillator strengths were calculated utilizing the SWIZARD program [27]. All these theoretical calculations were accomplished with the Gaussian 09 program [28].\n3. Results and Discussion 3.1.

Consequently, the energy of the electronic gap Eg \u00e9le is diminished where Eg \u00e9le= EHOMO \u2212 ELUMO.\nSubsequently, from the two tables, we notice that the electronic gap energy of te-\ntramer 4MEH-PPV (2.7 eV) and of the homopolymer 6P3HT (2.7 eV) are close to the ex-\nperimental values of the gap energy of the polymers MEH-PPV and P3HT, which are\nequal to 2.3 eV [29] and 2 eV [30], respectively.\nFurthermore, the experimental values of the maximum absorption for tetramer\nMEH-PPV and P3HT in chloroform solution are around 431 nm [31] and 451 nm [32],\nrespectively. The simulation carried out by the TD-DFT indicates that the maximum of\nthe absorption is 425 nm and 470 nm, respectively, for the 4MEH-PPV and 6P3HT. These\nvalues are closer to the experimental values than the ones given by the ZINDO, which\nsuggests that the TD-DFT method is more reliable than the ZINDO method.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 513 3 of 20\nThe first step to model these polymers is the optimization in the ground state of their structures by varying the number of monomeric units n (n = 1, 2, . . . ) in order to find the most stable geometries. The choice of conformer can be verified equally by the maximum absorption given by TD-DFT/CAM-B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) methods and ZINDO, comparing them to the experimental. The optoelectronic properties obtained by these calculations are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.\nFrom the results shown in these tables, it is clear that the increase of the number of monomers leads to the decrease of the HOMO level energy and the elevation of the LUMO level energy. Consequently, the energy of the electronic gap Eeleg is diminished where Eeleg = EHOMO \u2212 ELUMO. Subsequently, from the two tables, we notice that the electronic gap energy of tetramer 4MEH-PPV (2.7 eV) and of the homopolymer 6P3HT (2.7 eV) are close to the experimental values of the gap energy of the polymers MEH-PPV and P3HT, which are equal to 2.3 eV [29] and 2 eV [30], respectively. Furthermore, the experimental values of the maximum absorption for tetramer MEHPPV and P3HT in chloroform solution are around 431 nm [31] and 451 nm [32], respectively. The simulation carried out by the TD-DFT indicates that the maximum of the absorption is 425 nm and 470 nm, respectively, for the 4MEH-PPV and 6P3HT. These values are closer to the experimental values than the ones given by the ZINDO, which suggests that the TD-DFT method is more reliable than the ZINDO method. Relying on these results, we can choose the 4MEH-PPV as a conformer of the tetramer MEH-PPV and the homopolymer 6P3HT as a conformer of the polymer P3HT. Hence, the chain lengths of our polymers are formed by four monomeric units for the MEH-PPV and six monomeric units for the P3HT, and the geometric structures of these polymers are shown in Figure 2.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 513 4 of 20\nPolymers 2022, 13, x 4 of 19\nRelying on these results, we can choose the 4MEH-PPV as a conformer of the tetramer MEH-PPV and the homopolymer 6P3HT as a conformer of the polymer P3HT.

Knowing that the scan is the variation of the relative energy via the potential energy surface (PES) in the function of the angle of torsion, which is varied between 0 and 180\u00b0 with a step of 20\u00b0, we define the most stable conformer of each polymer by checking their minimum relative energy.\nFigure 3 illustrates the obtained results and shows that the PES of MEH-PPV presents two minimum relative energies, which correspond to the dihedral angles 40\u00b0 and 140\u00b0; however, the P3HT has only one minimum energy corresponding to the angle 40\u00b0. Furthermore, the dihedral angle between MEH-PPV and P3HT is equal to 60\u00b0, which is related to the torsion angle of the block copolymer. This twisted structure reveals that the torsion angle between the two basic polymers can affect the structural and electronic properties [33].\nDuring the conformation of these homopolymers, a study of the different architectures of their derived copolymers was carried out by the spin density and dihedral angle (scan).

It is noted that the Raman spectrum of P3HT is close to that of Ramif copolymer, and the characteristic bands of P3HT presented in this spectrum are also almost in agreement with that of P3HT oligomers [38\u201340]. This latter can confirm the great contribution of the P3HT blocks. Moreover, the characteristic peaks of MEH-PPV that appear in the spectrum of copolymers are approximate to those donated by the Raman spectra of P3HT oligomers, which correspond to 1632 cm\u22121, 1692 cm\u22121 (C=C stretching modes in vinylene group) [41,42].\n3.4. Electronic Properties\nTable 5 sums up the electronic properties of the copolymers MEH-PPV-P3HT.\nThe obtained results explain the coupling effects of the two basic homopolymers 4MEH-PPV and 6P3HT. To compare the graft copolymer (Ramif) with 4MEH-PPV, the graft of the P3HT on the chain of MEH-PPV reveals the destabilization with the increasing of the HOMO level of the energy from 4.29 eV to 4.54 eV and the LUMO level from 1.52 eV to 1.82 eV. These variations imply the decreasing of the band gap to be equal 2.72 eV, and this reduction subsequently explains that there is a charge transfer during this copolymerization. Nevertheless, the electronic properties of the copolymer Ramif are very proximate to that of P3HT; this can be explained by the rupture of MEH-PPV conjugation at the vinyl group, which implies the major contribution of P3HT. Additionally, for the block copolymer, the variation of HOMO and LUMO level energies entail a diminution of the gap energy by 0.3 eV and 0.1 eV compared with that of 4MEH-PPV and 6P3HT, respectively. These results interpret the increase of the length of the chain, which implies the higher charge transfer. The charge distribution in these copolymers was determined by the analysis of the molecular orbitals of HOMO and LUMO levels, which are shown in Figure 8. The electron density in the HOMO level is localized in the P3HT units; however, the electron density in the LUMO level is situated in the MEH-PPV units.\n3.5. Optical Properties 3.5.1.

Molecular orbitals of HOMO and LUMO levels of: (a) the Ramif copolymer and (b) the Block copolymer.\nAfter comparing the absorption spectra of these copolymers and those of the two basic homopolymers given by the two calculation methods, we can deduce the coupling effect on the optical properties. For the absorption spectra of the graft copolymer (Ramif), we notice that the two absorption bands, which are attributed to the n\u2192\u03c0* transitions (located between 200 nm and 350 nm), are the combination of two contributions (MEH-PPV + P3HT). However, the band that is assigned to the \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* transition, which corresponds to the maximum of absorption, exhibits a blueshift from that of P3HT and a redshift from that of MEH-PPV, where this shift refers to a low-charge transfer between the two polymers. It is clear that there is no enlargement of the spectrum of this copolymer, which verifies our hypothesis of rupture of MEH-PPV conjugation as well as the contribution and the dominance of P3HT in the \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* transition.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 513 11 of 20\nPolymers 2022, 13, x 10 of 19 3.5.

This increase generates a decrease\nPolymers 2022, 14, 513 12 of 20\nin the energy of the optical gap, the estimate of the energy of which is determined using the following formula [43]:\nEg = 1240 \u03bb\n(1)\nwhere \u03bb is the intersection between the linear part of spectra and the abscissa axis. Focusing on Table 7, we notice that the optical gap of this copolymer is lower than that of MEH-PPV and P3HT. Indeed, this decrease explains the higher charge transfer along the chain; subsequently, this assembly leads to the increase in the conjugation length that is due to the combination of the two blocks contributions of the MEH-PPV and P3HT, which clearly explains the enlargement of the absorption spectrum compared to the two basic homopolymers\nIn Figure 10, we represent the photoluminescence spectra of the two copolymers and those of the basic polymers calculated by the two methods TD-DFT and ZINDO. The values of the maximum emission are summarized in Table 8.\nAccording to this table and the photoluminescence spectra of these copolymers and the basic homopolymers, it is noted that the maximum emissions of the graft copolymer (Ramif) given by the TD-DFT and ZINDO methods are very near to that of P3HT. However, the photoluminescence spectra of the two copolymers present a redshift compared to the MEH-PPV. These variations explain the great contribution of P3HT and confirm the hypothesis of rupture of MEH-PPV conjugation. We summarize in Table 9 the characteristics of each transition of these polymers, such as emission energy, oscillator strength, the electronic assignments, and the radiative life time \u03c4, which is estimated by the Einstein transition probabilities [46]:\n\u03c4 = c3 2 ( E f lu )2 f (2)\nPolymers 2022, 14, 513 13 of 20\nPolymers 2022, 13, x 12 of 19\nTable 8.

From these results, we deduced that the coupling of MEH-PPV and P3HT under a block architecture improves the electronic and optical properties of the original compounds through interaction and a charge transfer due to the extension of conjugation. An enlargement of the absorption spectrum and a reduction of the electronic and optical gap are the consequences of the MEH-PPV/P3HT combination. On the other hand, the assembly of MEH-PPV and P3HT under the graft architecture implies that the electronic properties are close to that of P3HT; this can be explained by the rupture of MEH-PPV conjugation. Thus, this copolymer exhibits properties that allow it to be used as an active layer in organic photovoltaic cells.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.M., and M.L.; formal analysis, M.L., M.M.A. and W.T.; funding acquisition, M.L.; investigation, M.M.A., and M.M.; methodology, M.M.; project administration, M.M.A., and M.M.; supervision, K.A.; validation, M.M.A., and M.M.; writing\u2014 original draft, M.L,. and M.M.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.L., M.M.A., M.M., and K.A.
