    "abstractText": "In 5G New Radio (NR), beam management entails periodic and continuous transmission and reception of control signals in the form of synchronization signal blocks (SSBs), used to perform initial access and/or channel estimation. However, this procedure demands continuous energy consumption, which is particularly challenging to handle for low-cost, low-complexity, and battery-constrained devices, such as RedCap devices to support mid-market Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. In this context, this work aims at reducing the energy consumption during beam management for RedCap devices, while ensuring that the desired Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are met. To do so, we formalize an optimization problem in an Indoor Factory (InF) scenario to select the best beam management parameters, including the beam update periodicity and the beamwidth, to minimize energy consumption based on users\u2019 distribution and their speed. The analysis yields the regions of feasibility, i.e., the upper limit(s) on the beam management parameters for RedCap devices, that we use to provide design guidelines accordingly.",

INTRODUCTION In the last few years, standardization bodies and industry players have developed several Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, such as Long Range (LoRa), Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT), and SigFox to support IoT applications in many fields, ranging from agriculture, transportation, logistics, and healthcare, as well as for smart cities [1], [2]. Along these lines, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is also promoting new specifications [3] to simplify 5G NR standard operations to support high-end IoT devices, referred to as RedCap devices [4].\nAmong other features, RedCap devices may be operating in the lower part of the millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum to improve the network performance in more demanding scenarios, such as in an indoor factory scenario [5]. Communication at mmWaves, however, requires directionality between the transmitter and the receiver to compensate for the additional path loss experienced at those frequencies, typically realized via Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna arrays. In 5G NR, beam management was designed to allow the endpoints to identify and continuously maintain the optimal direction of transmission, e.g., during initial access and/or channel estimation [6]. Specifically, beam management implies exhaustive search based on Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), collected into bursts and transmitted by a Next Generation Node Base (gNB) according to pre-specified\nintervals and directions. However, beam management involves severe energy consumption for sending and receiving control signals, which is a function of the beamwidth and periodicity of SSBs [7]. Even though this is generally not an issue for 5G NR systems, it may be challenging to handle for low-complexity, battery-powered RedCap devices, and may degrade the network performance.\nRecently, the scientific community has explored possible simplifications of the 5G NR standard to optimize power consumption for RedCap devices [5], for example via simplified air interface procedures [8], protocol stack, antenna configurations [9], and enhanced power-saving functionalities such as Discontinuous Reception (eDRX) or wake-up signals [10]. The 3GPP has also launched some Study and Work Items in this domain, for example in TR 38.869 [11] to study low-power wake-up signal and receiver for RedCap devices. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work focusing on beam management for RedCap devices, which stimulates further research in this domain.\nTo fill these gaps, in this work we formalize an optimization problem to determine the optimal beam management design for RedCap devices to minimize the energy consumption. Notably, we focus on an Indoor Factory (InF) scenario, and derive the so-called regions of feasibility, i.e., the upper limit(s) on the beam management parameters, including the number of SSBs per burst and the burst periodicity, to guarantee that the Quality of Service (QoS) constraints are met, for example that User Equipments (UEs) never go undetected and/or maintain alignment as they move. Simulation results demonstrate that there exists an optimal configuration for beam management to promote energy efficiency, which depends on the speed of the UEs, the beamwidth, and other network parameters.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we present our system model (deployment, energy, mobility, and beam management). In Sec. III we describe our optimization problem. Also, we describe the impact of the number of antennas at the gNB on the QoS constraints. In Sec. IV we present the simulation results and provide design guidelines towards the optimal set of parameters for beam management. Finally, conclusions are given in Sec. V."

Then, K UEs are uniformly deployed at height hUE around the clutters. The location of UEk, for k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . ,K}, is given by (dk, \u03d5k), where dk is the distance between UEk and the gNB, and \u03d5k is the phase of UEk measured counterclockwise. The UEs are assumed to be moving on a circle at constant velocity v in a counterclockwise direction.\nThe Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) \u03b3k at UEk is given by [13]\n\u03b3k(d3D) = HLPr(d3D) +HN(1\u2212 Pr(d3D))\nN0 \u00b7B \u00b7 NF/GgNB,kGUE , (1)\nwhere d3D = \u221a\n(hgNB \u2212 hUE)2 + d2k is the distance between the gNB and UEk, N0 is the noise Power Spectral Density, B is the channel bandwidth, and NF is the noise figure. HL and HN include the effect of path loss, shadowing and fading parameter for the Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Lineof-Sight (NLoS) channels, respectively and Pr(d3D) is the LoS probability, as described in [12]. Specifically, we have\nHj = |hkj |2PLkj , j \u2208 {L,N}, (2)\nwhere hkj and PL k j are the channel fading gain and path loss for the LoS (L) and NLoS (N) links, respectively. In Eq. (1), GgNB,k (GUE) is the beamforming gain at the gNB (UE). We assume analog beamforming (a realistic assumption for RedCap devices to minimize the energy consumption [14]), such that the gNB (UEs) can probe only one direction at a time. Specifically, the gNB is equipped with NgNB antennas, and the beamforming gain is expressed as [15]\nGgNB,k = sin\n( NgNB\u03c0\n2 sin \u03b8k\n) / sin (\u03c0 2 sin \u03b8k ) , (3)\nwhere \u03b8k is the angular offset with respect to UEk, as described in Sec.

Each SS block is mapped into a certain angular direction so that directional measurements can be made based on the quality of the received signal, e.g., in terms of the SNR. To reduce the overhead, SSBs can be gathered together into SS bursts. An SS burst consists of NSS \u2208 {8, 16, 32, 64} SSBs, and the periodicity between consecutive SS bursts is TSS \u2208 {5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160} ms."

Due to the finite pre-defined codebook of directions available at the gNB, UEk comes with a non-zero initial angular offset \u03b8i,k = min(\u03d5k \u2212 \u03d5\u0304br) with respect to the gNB antenna boresight directions \u03d5\u0304br . = [0, 1, 2, . . . , SD \u2212 1]\u22063dB, as represented in Fig. 1.\nAt the same time we assume that, during beam management, UEk can move in a counterclockwise direction at constant velocity v. During this time, UEk may lose beam alignment and the corresponding beamforming gain, and get disconnected if the resulting SNR is lower than a pre-defined threshold [18]. Thus, we define \u03b8v,k as the angular offset due to mobility during beam management, i.e.,\n\u03b8v,k = vTBM/dk. (8)\nIn Eq. (8), TBM is the time for beam management, and is measured as the delay from the first SSB transmission to the completion of the sweep in all possible angular directions, which can be expressed as in [6, Eq.

Therefore, the overall angular offset for UEk during beam management, due to both the initial offset (\u03b8i,k) and the offset accumulated due to mobility (\u03b8v,k), can be expressed as\n\u03b8k = |\u03b8v,k + \u03b8i,k|.

In (11), (11b) ensures that the SNR at UEk is greater than or equal to a minimum threshold \u03c4 , which is large enough to ensure that UEk can be properly detected, and (11c) restricts the number of antenna elements at the gNB to 64, as expected for RedCap devices.\nModeling of the constraints. The optimization problem determines the optimal value of NgNB, referred to as N\u2217, based on the SNR \u03b3k, \u2200k, which depends on GgNB, so on the angular offset \u03b8k introduced by the moving UEs. Indeed, as the UE moves at constant velocity v during the beam management process, it may lose alignment with respect to the associated beam, potentially deteriorating the beamforming gain. This may cause the SNR of UEk to drop below the sensitivity threshold \u03c4 , preventing it from being detected. The factors that may lead to misalignment include: (i) the UE velocity v (the faster the UE, the sooner it may lose alignment); (ii) the beam management time TBM and, consequently TSS and NSS (the slower the beam management procedure, the higher the probability that the UE would lose alignment); and (iii) the number of antennas NgNB, which defines the beamwidth (the narrower the beam, the higher the probability that the UE would lose alignment). In the following, we investigate the impact of those terms on the optimization problem.\nIn Fig. 2 we plot \u03b8\u0304 (the angular offset averaged over all K UEs in the scenario) vs. NgNB for different values of v and TSS, and for NSS = {8, 16}. We observe that \u03b8\u0304 initially decreases with NgNB. In fact, when the number of antennas is small, the beam is large enough to ensure continuous alignment despite mobility. In this region, \u03b8\u0304 is thus dominated by the initial offset \u03b8i,k with respect to the antenna boresight direction. Then, as NgNB increases, the beams become progressively narrower, and the number of SSBs that are required to be sent to completely sweep the beam space also increases, which increases the beam management time. In these conditions, the angular offset due to mobility \u03b8v,k increases accordingly as per Eq. (8). In addition, we observe that in both Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) the angular offset for v = 2 m/s and TSS = 20 ms overlaps with the offset for\nv = 1 m/s and TSS = 40 ms. Similarly, the offset for v = 2 m/s and TSS = 40 overlaps over the offset for v = 4 m/s and TSS = 20 ms. Therefore, we conclude that the angular offset depends on v and TSS only through their product. This observation becomes significant while analyzing the feasibility regions in Sec. IV.\nNotice that the zigzag effect in Fig. 2 is due to the fact that \u03b8v,k and hence \u03b8\u0304 is a function of TBM which, as reported in Eq. (9), is a ceiling function. This effect increases as NgNB increases, i.e., as \u03b8v,k dominates the average angular offset \u03b8\u0304.\nAdditionally, in Fig. 3 we plot the average antenna gain at the gNB (GgNB, averaged over all K UEs in the scenario) vs. NgNB for different values of v and TSS, and for NSS = {8, 16}. We notice that GgNB initially increases with NgNB, and then drops after a threshold due to mobility. If NM is the number of antennas corresponding to the point where GgNB is maximum, we conclude that the optimization problem in (11) is restricted to the values of NgNB \u2264 NM because the energy consumption increases with NgNB. We further observe that NM decreases with v and TSS, and increases with NSS. In other words, the product vTSS for a given value of NSS establishes an upper limit to determine the regions of feasibility, as further discussed in Sec. IV: if the SNR constraints are not satisfied for NgNB \u2264 NM, the optimization problem will be infeasible.\nOptimization algorithm. Based on the optimization problem in (11), and the considerations above, we conclude that the energy consumption at the UE increases monotonically with the number of antennas at the gNB. This suggests that the minimum value of NgNB at which the SNR constraints are satisfied should be the optimal NgNB, or N\u2217. For a given transmit power (PT ) and SNR threshold (\u03c4 ), if the constraints are not met, the problem is infeasible."

            "text": "In this section, we evaluate the energy consumption for beam management as a function of NSS, TSS, NgNB, v, PT , and \u03c4 . Specifically, we perform 105 Monte Carlo simulations in MATLAB for each combination of parameters, and in each simulation we find N\u2217 using the algorithm presented in Sec. III. The simulation parameters are reported in Tab. I, taken from [12, Table 7.2-4] for the InF-SH scenario, [5] for the RedCap devices, and [17] for the power consumption.\nThe goal of our analysis is to determine the regions of feasibility, and the corresponding set of 5G NR beam management parameters which minimize the energy consumption while satisfying SNR constraints. Notice that we assume zero misdetection probability in the analysis, i.e., no user goes misdetected during the beam management process. A. Impact of TSS and NSS\nFigs. 4(a) and 4(b) depict the UE misdetection probability and N\u2217, respectively, as a function of TSS and v, for NSS = 8. While N\u2217 depends on PT and \u03c4 , it does not change with v, TSS, and NSS. This is because the objective function always drives the optimization problem towards the minimum value of NgNB that meets the SNR constraints for each UE, so as\nto minimize the energy consumption. In turn, this sets N\u2217 to the minimum value corresponding to the largest angular offset beyond which the problem becomes infeasible (which determines the values of v and TSS for a given NSS), as described in Sec. III.\nNevertheless, given PT and \u03c4 , there exists only a limited set of values of v, TSS at NSS for which the SNR constraints are met. As a consequence, some bars are missing in Fig. 4(b), which indicates that the corresponding problem is infeasible. For example, for TSS = 160 ms and v \u2265 1 m/s, there are no values of NgNB for which SNRk \u2265 \u03c4, \u2200k. This is also observed in Fig. 4(a), where the misdetection probability at TSS = 160 ms is greater than zero for v \u2265 1 m/s. Similarly, v \u2265 2 m/s is infeasible for TSS \u2265 80 ms, whereas for v \u2264 4 m/s and TSS \u2264 20 ms the problem is feasible, which yields N\u2217 = 5.4 on average.1 This is because increasing v or TSS increases the average angular offset as per Eq. (10), and may cause the UEs to lose beam alignment sooner, thus making the problem infeasible.\nB. Impact of PT and \u03c4\nFig. 5 illustrates the average optimal number of antennas N\u2217 as a function of the transmission power PT and TSS, for \u03c4 \u2208 {3, 7} dB, v = 1 m/s and NSS = 8. We observe that as PT decreases and \u03c4 increases, N\u2217 increases. Indeed, increasing the number of antennas leads to a higher (best case) beamforming gain, thus possibly improving the minimum SNR at the UEs. At the same time, decreasing PT and/or increasing \u03c4 also reduces the set of values for which the problem is feasible, as demonstrated by the missing bars in Fig. 5. In fact, although the angular offset does not directly depend on PT and \u03c4 , a\n1Notice that, while we constrain N\u2217 to be an integer in each Monte Carlo simulation, here N\u2217 represents the average of different realizations."

Table II reports these feasibility regions for PT = 18 dBm and \u03c4 \u2208 {3, 7, 10} dB, in terms of the highest product of v and TSS supported by the system. We recall that, as observed in Sec. III, both v and TSS have the same impact on the angular offset, and the feasibility regions are perfectly defined by the product vTSS . For example, for NSS = 8 and \u03c4 = 7 dB, the feasibility region is upper bounded by vTSS = 0.08 m. The results in Table II have been obtained for different values of NSS and \u03c4 , and v \u2264 25 m/s using a similar analysis as in Sec. IV-A.\nFig. 6 depicts the feasibility regions in terms of the upper bounds of parameters NSS and TSS for which the optimization problem in (11) is feasible, for PT = 18 dBm and \u03c4 \u2208 {3, 7, 10} dB. These plots were generated using the values in Table II, and are intended to provide guidelines towards the optimal 5G NR beam management configurations to minimize the energy consumption for RedCap devices. In general, we observe that as \u03c4 increases, the feasibility regions become smaller. This is because increasing the threshold \u03c4 translates into a tighter constraint on the SNR (C1 in (11)), thus the optimization problem yields larger values of N\u2217 to increase\nthe beamforming gain. However, this also implies narrower beams, which in turn reduce the angular offset which can be tolerated by the system.\nFurthermore, the size of the feasibility regions is inversely proportional to v and TSS, as expected from the analysis in Sec. III. Indeed, if the UEs move faster, or if the beam management process takes longer, the angular offset in Eq. (10) also increases, and so does the probability that the UEs would lose beam alignment. However, we can see from Eq. (9) that TSS does not influence the beam management time TBM if SD \u2264 NSS, i.e., if sending the SSBs requires exactly one burst [19]. Based on the expression of SD in Eq. (5), this condition is true if NgNB \u2264 3, 5, 11, 21, for NSS = 8, 16, 32, 64 respectively. In general, it is convenient to choose NgNB accordingly, to limit the impact of TSS on the shape of the feasibility regions."

            "text": "The feasibility regions in Fig. 6 show that the smallest (highest) feasible TSS (NSS) (i.e., the bottom-right part of the feasibility region) would be the optimal configuration for the beam management. Indeed, this choice implies faster beam alignment and better SNR on average, but also entails the highest overhead as more time resources are used for sending control signals at the expense of data transmissions [6, Fig.\n17]. Furthermore, let ECt be the average energy consumption for sending SSBs over time, which can be expressed as [7]:\nECt = (PUETSSB)NSS/TSS, (12)\nwhere PUETSSB represents the average energy consumption for sending one SSB, as per Eq. (4).\nOverall, there exists a trade-off between the beam management periodicity and the resulting overhead and ECt, which leads to the optimal values of TSS and NSS. We thus propose to operate in the top-left portion of the feasibility regions, i.e., choosing the highest possible TSS at NSS = 8. In this way, we minimize the average energy consumption per unit time, while still satisfying the SNR constraints as we are in the feasibility regions. For instance, for PT = 18 dBm and \u03c4 \u2208 {3, 7, 10} dB, the optimal configuration for (NSS, TSS) at v = 1 m/s is (8, 160 ms), (8, 80 ms) and (8, 20 ms), respectively."

Therefore, we formalized an optimization problem to minimize the energy consumption during beam management, while ensuring that some desired QoS requirements, measured in terms of the misdetection probability, are met. Through simulations, we identified the feasibility regions where the problem can be solved, and proposed the optimal values of the beam management parameters for RedCap devices, such as the optimal SSB size and periodicity, to maintain a minimum energy consumption while optimizing latency and overhead. As part of our future work, we will generalize our optimization problem to other scenarios like smart agriculture, introduce additional mobility models, as well as consider more sophisticated optimization methods, e.g., based on machine learning."
