    "abstractText": "The combination of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapies is the gold standard for treating intestinal failures. The possibility of chemical solubility in water is mandatory for intelligent capsules. Functionalised silk fibroin with peptides and covalently linking different molecular entities to its structure make this protein a platform for preparing gels dissolving in the small and large intestine for drug delivery. In the present study, we linked a peptide containing the cell-adhesive motif Arginine\u2013Glycine\u2013Aspartic acid (RGD) to degummed silk fibres (DSF). Regenerated silk fibroin (RS) films obtained by dissolving functionalised DSF in formic acid were used to prepare composite gelatin. We show that such composite gelatin remains stable and elastic in the simulated gastric fluid (SGF) but can dissolve in the small and large intestines\u2019 neutral-pH simulated intestine fluid (SIF). These findings open up the possibility of designing microfabricated and physically programmable scaffolds that locally promote tissue regeneration, thanks to bio-enabled materials based on functionalised",

            "text": "The development of ingestible devices has been recently considered as a valid alternative to endoscopic and invasive clinical techniques for a broad range of applications, from ingestible electronics for physiological monitoring of a patient to programmable dosage of drugs [1\u20139]. These devices are often made of, at least in part, elastic polymers for packaging such devices [10]. The main drawback is that this approach relies on complications caused by the migration of fractured components that requires surgical solutions for their removal [11\u201315]. Gelatin is a collagen material that can be dissolved in water at 37 \u25e6C and is generally used for hydrogels in the fabrication of scaffolds for tissue engineering and drug delivery systems [16,17]. However, without crosslinking agents, it suffers from rapid dissolution in gastric and intestinal fluids [18,19]. Recently, inspired by silk fibroin due to its impressive biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mechanical properties [20], a new class of hydrogels has been brought to the attention of the scientific community, i.e., it was found that collagen interacted with silk fibroin in aqueous solution making possible the fabrication of scaffolds where drugs can be embedded and released at controlled rates [21,22]. A further advantage of this novel method to obtain hybrid collagens is the possibility of realising\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4605. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27144605 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 4605 2 of 11\narginine\u2013glycine\u2013aspartic acid (RGD) functionalised silk fibroin nanoparticles to mitigate intestinal inflammatory state [23] as well as, for silk peptide, to improve energy and glucose metabolism and promote the gut microbiota\u2019s homeostasis in obese young animals [24]. Incorporating exogenous RGD peptide on Bombyx mori silk fibroin membranes has been used in the ex vivo cultivation and transplantation of cells to treat severe eye diseases and reconstruct the ocular surface [25]. However, collagen is insoluble or at least is partially insoluble. Thus, the challenge is transforming water-soluble collagen into water-stable films for ingestible devices. In the proposed method, the opportunity to covalently link synthetic peptides to degummed silk fibres (DSF) and then apply a reverse engineering approach to get regenerated silk fibroin (RS) films appears particularly relevant, offering the possibility of promoting the surface interactions between cells and functionalised biomaterials with designed architectural forms and structure [26\u201328]. For this purpose, several authors reported the use of cell-binding epitopes of the major adhesive proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM), e.g., fibronectin, the well-known universal adhesive RGD peptide [23,29,30]. When grafted on nanomaterials, this peptide has been reported to enhance cell adhesion [23,29] or to enable specific cell targeting for drug delivery [30]. Accordingly, we synthesised a peptide containing the RGD motif (MO-07, sequence: YRGDS), endowed with anti-inflammatory and cell adhesion properties. We linked it to DSF by activating the -COOH groups on the backbone of DSF and subsequent functionalisation with the peptide. The synergistic effect of the functionalisation of DSF and the attachment of the peptide endowed the resultant regenerated silk film with remarkable differences in mechanical properties. The synergistic combination of MO-07/RS with gelatin stabilised the composite at 37 \u25e6C in a simulated gastric fluid (SGF) environment, showing that this compound remains elastic and stable in an acidic environment while partially dissolving in the small and large intestines\u2019 simulated intestine fluid (SIF) environment."

Quantitative chromatographic analysis of the reacted peptide indicated that 19\u201322% (n = 3) of the peptide was consumed by the reaction and therefore linked to the fibroin.

The new peaks at 2974 cm\u22121 and 2881 cm\u22121 in the spectrum of MO-07/RS (Figure 2b) belonged to the methylene C\u2013H asymmetric/symmetric stretches of the MO-07 peptide. The peak at 3620 cm\u22121 can be attributed to the \u2013OH stretch [35]. According to the obtained spectra, it is possible to observe a shift in the amide I band (from 1654 to 1637 cm\u22121); this could suggest amidation between the RS and MO-07 peptide by the grafting method [36,37]. The mechanical properties were evaluated in detail by assessing the practicability of the peptide-modified RS film as stretchable materials (Figure 3). The functionalisation effect of the peptide addition to the RS on the stretchability is illustrated in Figure 3a. As a result, the stretching properties, measured in terms of strain ratio \u03bb = l/l0, where l0 is the initial length of the sample, of the MO-07/RS sample, were improved with higher strain at break.

Briefly, the high content of Ca2+ ions dispersed in RS film allows the re-dispersion in water to obtain a gel. Combining the above points will enable us to adopt a solvent-free method for developing RS gelatin composites. We then tested the compressive strength of the RS gelatin and MO-07/RS composites (Figure 4). As depicted in Figure 4a, the MO-07/RS gelatin composite shows milky white and opaque colour. During the compressive test (compressed to 60%) of the RS gelatin and MO-07/RS gelatin composite (Figures 4b and S1), it was clear that the RS gelatin shows linear elasticity, while the MO-07/RS sample did not exhibit any linear plateau region. From the comparisons of the corresponding stress-strain curves in Figure 4b, the composite gelatin achieved a high compression stress of 160 \u00b1 8 kPa, which was about four times higher than that of RS gelatin gel (37 \u00b1 7 kPa). These findings suggest gelatin\u2019s mechanical properties can be tuned by adding peptide-modified RS.\n\u03bb=7\nFigure 3.

For our experiments, we consider the transit time as the time that the food takes to reach the large and small intestine, and it was estimated that the gastric time was between 35.5 min and 57 min, while the transit time for the small intestine was about 261 min [39,40]. The pH-dependent dissolution appearance and data of samples are reported in Figure 5a,b. Adding MO-07/RS to gelatin showed a stable degradation pattern at a pH value of 1.2. In contrast, for neutral pH values (i.e., 6.8), we observed a degradation pattern that indicated a total dissolution for the gelatin added with RS after 44 min and a weight loss of about 50% for the MO-07/RS-modified gelatin after 4 h. The degradation of neat gelatin in the SIF environment appeared evident with a degradation time of a few minutes. The gelatin and RS gelatin in SGF dissolved in a few minutes (data not shown). Interestingly, once strained, the MO-07/RS composite showed elastic properties without cracks (Figure 5c). Therefore, by modulating gelatin composition by physical blending peptide-modified RS, we could match both the elastic and enteric properties of ingestible gelatin. By the comparison of the FTIR spectra of gelatin [41], MO-07/RS, and MO-07/RS-modified gelatin, the secondary silk protein structure [42] was determined to consist of side chains (1605\u20131616 cm\u22121), \u03b2-sheets (1616\u20131622, 1622\u20131628, 1628\u20131638, and 1697\u20131704 cm\u22121), random coils (1638\u20131647 and 1647\u20131656 cm\u22121), \u03b1-helices (1656\u20131663 cm\u22121), and turns (1663\u20131671, 1671\u20131686, and 1686\u20131697 cm\u22121). The addition of gelatin to MO-07/RS increased the \u03b2-sheets content (Figure S7). These results indicate that the interaction between MO-07/RS and gelatin induced more stable structures in the gelatin in terms of elasticity and insolubility.\nFigure 4.

In contrast, for neutral pH values (i.e., 6.8), we observed a degradation pattern that indicated a total dissolution for the gelatin added with RS after 44 min and a weight loss of about 50% for the MO-07/RS-modified gelatin after 4 h. The degradation of neat gelatin in the SIF environment appeared evident with a degradation time of a few minutes. The gelatin and RS gelatin in SGF dissolved in a few minutes (data not shown). Interestingly, once strained, the MO-07/RS composite showed elastic properties without cracks (Figure 5c). Therefore, by modulating gelatin composition by physical blending peptide-modified RS, we could match both the elastic and enteric properties of ingestible gelatin. By the comparison of the FTIR spectra of gelatin [41], MO-07/RS, and MO-07/RS-modified gelatin, the secondary silk protein structure [42] was determined to consist of side chains (1605\u20131616 cm\u22121), \u03b2-sheets (1616\u20131622, 1622\u20131628, 1628\u20131638, and 1697\u20131704 cm\u22121), random coils (1638\u20131647 and 1647\u20131656 cm\u22121), \u03b1-helices (1656\u20131663 cm\u22121), and turns (1663\u20131671, 1671\u20131686, and 1686\u20131697 cm\u22121). The addition of gelatin to MO-07/RS increased the \u03b2-sheets content (Figure S7). These results indicate that the interaction between MO-07/RS and gelatin induced more stable structures in the gelatin in terms of elasticity and insolubility.

The extract fibres were washed twice with water and dried at room temperature under a chemical hood in laminar flow. To prepare the degummed silk fibres (hereon DSF) for the functionalisation, 833.8 mg of DSF was weighed, placed in a 50 mL pre-weighed tube, and covered with 30 mL of PBS (10 mM, pH 6.5). After being left there for 30 min, PBS was removed from the well with a dispensable graduated plastic pipet, and the DSF were squeezed with a spatula to remove as much PBS as possible. The -COOH groups were activated by treating the wet DSF with a 40 mL of a freshly prepared solution of 0.5 mM EDC*HCl (N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u2032-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride) and 0.7 mM NHS (N-Hydroxysuccinimide) in PBS pH 6.5 for 15 min.

To quantify, by indirect measurement, the concentration of peptide MO-07 linked to DSF, samples of the peptide solutions were taken before and after the reaction and analysed by UHPLC in the same conditions used to prepare the calibration curve. This procedure enabled us to define the quantity of peptide consumed by the reaction, corresponding to the peptide linked to DSF."

A water droplet of about 5 \u00b5L was applied, and photographs were taken at an interval of 5 s. The contact angles were measured in a goniometer (FT\u00c5200, First Ten \u00c5ngstroms, Inc., Portsmouth, NH, USA) using the FT\u00c5 Drop Shape Analysis Software, Version 2.0 (2002, Portsmouth, NH, USA). FTIR investigation on MO-07 peptide, RS, and peptide-modified RS films was performed using a PerkinElmer spectrometer in ATR mode. Measurements were performed with a resolution of 4 cm\u22121, and the number of scans was 200 for each spectrum. The background spectra were recorded before each spectrum. The measurements were performed at room temperature. The spectra were collected in the range of 4000 to 400 cm\u22121. The FTIR spectra of MO-07/RS and MO-07/RS\u2013gelatin composite were deconvoluted by subtracting a linear baseline and applying a Gaussian deconvoluting curve by Origin 9 software (Origin Lab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). The spectra were collected in the range 1750 to 1450 cm\u22121, the amide I and amide II bands. Deconvolution was performed using Lorentzian line shape, and the relative content of the structure was obtained by curve-fitting and measuring the relative areas. The mechanical properties of the RS and MO-07/RS films were tested with a tensile testing machine (Lloyd Instr. LR30K, Bognor Regis UK). Rectangular samples (1.5 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 100 \u00b5m) were stretched with a strain rate of 5 mm\u00b7min\u22121 using a 50 N load cell.
