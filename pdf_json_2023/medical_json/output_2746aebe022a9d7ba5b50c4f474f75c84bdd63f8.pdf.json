ABSTRACT Objective The aim of the study is to estimate trends in the prevalence and associated factors of noncommunicable disease (NCD) risk factors in adults from 2007 to 2020 in Cabo Verde. Design Populationbased crosssectional study. Setting Nationally representative samples of adult population in Cabo Verde from the 2007 and 2020 STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor surveillance (STEPS) surveys. Participants The sample included 1760 adults in 2007 and 3721 in 2020. Outcome measures Included fruit/vegetable consumption, low physical activity, sedentary behaviour, current tobacco use, hazardous alcohol use, diabetes, total elevated cholesterol, hypertension and overweight/obesity. Logistic regressions adjusted for sociodemographic factors were applied to estimate predictors of each of the nine NCD risk factors. Results Compared with participants in the study year 2007, participants in the study year 2020 had a significantly higher prevalence of low physical activity (adjusted OR (AOR): 2.21, 95% CI: 1.15 to 4.25) and overweight/obesity (AOR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.23) and significantly lower rate of hypertension (AOR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.93). Low physical activity (AOR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.23 to 2.10), overweight/obesity (AOR: 2.59, 95% CI: 2.10 to 3.20), current tobacco use (AOR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.36 to 2.75), hypertension (AOR: 5.45, 95% CI: 4.24 to 7.00), diabetes (AOR: 8.40, 95% CI: 4.65 to 15.18) and elevated total cholesterol (AOR: 4.58, 95% CI: 2.83 to 7.39) were more common among the 50\u201364yearolds. Being male increased the odds of current tobacco use (AOR: 3.64, 95% CI: 2.75 to 4.81) and hazardous alcohol use (AOR: 4.79, 95% CI: 3.15 to 7.27), and decreased the odds of low physical activity (AOR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.58) and overweight/obesity (AOR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.56). Conclusions Of the nine NCD risk factors evaluated from 2007 to 2020 in Cabo Verde, two increased (overweight/ obesity and low physical activity) and one decreased (hypertension). Several associated variables were identified for each individual NCD risk factor that can help in guiding interventions. INTRODUCTION Majority (>85%) of death attributable to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) happen in lowincome and middle income countries. In Cabo Verde, a small island lower middle income country (population 540 000) in Africa, the majority (70%) of deaths were attributable to NCDs, and life expectancy was 73.3 years and the literacy rate was 85%. Considering stark increases of NCDs in the subSaharan Africa region, it is important to gain an insight in the local determinants of NCDs. Against this backdrop, national communitybased data on NCD risk factors among adults in Cabo Verde are needed. In the population of Cabo Verde, 7% had diabetes and 25% had hypertension. Behavioural factors, including alcohol abuse, unhealthy diet, smoking and physical inactivity increase the risk of dying from a NCDs. In Cabo Verde, in 2016, 6% of adults engaged in harmful alcohol use, 9% were current smokers and 19% were physically inactive. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY",

There was no target for physical inactivity which increased from 2007 to 2020.25 According to the Global Nutrition Report,6 Cabo Verde had little or no progress in terms of diet- related NCD targets, including obesity.6 Some of the reduction of hypertension may be attributed to strengthened implementation of NCD programme in Cabo Verde including the WHO PEN primary care interventions addressing hypertension, etc.24 In unadjusted analysis, among men, there has been a reduction of hazardous alcohol use, which may be related to implementing multisector interventions to prevent alcohol and other substance abuse,26 as well as the training of primary healthcare professionals on preventing alcohol abuse and a presidential campaign on \u2018Less alcohol, More life\u2019.26 Furthermore, the per capita (\u226515 years) alcohol consumption (in litres of pure alcohol) reduced from 7.6 in 2010\nto 5.7 in 2016.27 In terms of current tobacco use, there was some reduction from 14.1% in 2007 to 11.9% in 2020, but this was insignificant. Although some tobacco control measures, such as mass media and advertising bans, are in place, there is no policy or weak measure regarding smoke- free environments, health warnings and taxation (cigarettes have not become less affordable between 2010 and 2020).28\nSimilar to previous trend studies in India,29 Mongolia30 31 and Iran,32 low physical activity and/or overweight/obesity increased over time. In our study, the prevalence of hypertension decreased over time, which is similar to Mongolia,33 while in India,29 South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo34 and Mozambique,35 the prevalence of hypertension increased over time. In comparison to other African countries, the proportion of 3\u20139 NCD risk factors (42.9% in 2007 and 45.7% in 2020) in this study was higher than in Malawi (3\u20137 NCD risk factors, 16.5%)9 and in Zambia (26.7%, 3\u201310 NCD risk factors).10 The prevalence of overweight/obesity in 2020 (50.4%) and the prevalence of diabetes (5.1%) in 2020 was similar\nP atna).

Lower education was associated with insufficient fruit/vegetable intake, current tobacco use and hazardous alcohol use, while higher education was associated with low physical activity, sedentary behaviour and overweight/obesity. Lower economic status was positively associated with overweight/obesity, and hypertension, and being unemployed had a higher odds of low physical activity, inadequate fruit/vegetable intake and current tobacco use. These results show how the nine specific NCD risk factors can be targeted differently depending on sex, age, educational level, economic, and work status.\nThe results of the study may have implications for policy and practice on the prevention and control of NCD risk factors among adults in Cabo Verde. We found a large increase in the prevalence of overweight/obesity from 36.8% to 50.4% and low physical activity from 19.1% to 36.7%, implying that a large population is at increased risk of morbidity and mortality.1 According to WHO guidelines,37 \u2018Adults should do at least 150\u2013300 min of moderate- intensity aerobic physical activity; or at least 75\u2013150 min of vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity; or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorousintensity activity throughout the week, for substantial health benefits\u2019.\nA high proportion (45.7%) of the study population had 3\u20139 NCD risk factors, meaning that many people had multiple NCD risk factors, requiring that health promotion reduces multiple behavioural NCD risk factors (such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful alcohol use) and promote early detection, treatment and healthcare of NCDs at primary level.38"

            "text": "Based on two national community- based surveys in adults from 2007 to 2020 in Cabo Verde, we found that of the nine risk factors for NCD evaluated in the past 13 years, two increased (overweight/obesity and low physical activity) and one decreased (hypertension). Several factors associated with NCD risk factors were identified, including level of education, age, sex, economic status\nand work status, which can guide interventions. Considering the high proportion of having multiple NCD risk factors, interventions are needed that target multiple, in particular modifiable, NCD risk factors, such as low physical activity and overweight/obesity. Cabo Verde can strengthen the implementation of its national policy for physical activity and food, including national physical activity communication campaigns and national mass participation events on physical activity, and in addition to promoting physical activity through community sports and for older adults, physical activity promotion can include workplaces, childcare settings, public open spaces and through walking and cycling. The national food policy can be strengthened by introducing sugarsweetened beverage tax, policy to limit saturated fatty acid intake, policy to introduce industrially produced trans fatty acids and policy to reduce the impact of marketing of foods and beverages high in saturated fats, trans fatty acids, free sugars or salt in children."
