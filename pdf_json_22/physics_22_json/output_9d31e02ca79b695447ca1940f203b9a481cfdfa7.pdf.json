INTRODUCTION\nProblems of diffusion with stochastic resetting has become an important field of study in recent years [1, 2]. In any stochastic process, the event of resetting instantly sets the system back to its initial state after random times. These time intervals are drawn from distributions which may have various forms [1, 3\u20139]. Noninstantaneous resetting has also been studied [10]. The idea of resetting has found applications in the problems of chemical reactions [11\u201313], biological processes [14\u2013 16], and magnetic phase transitions [17]. Resetting in the presence of space dependent potentials introduce interesting new features [18\u201327]. Our work below is related to the latter theme.\nOne of the motivations to study resetting comes from the fact that it may be used as a strategy to expedite the first passage to a target [1]. It is now known that for resetting at a constant rate, the optimal resetting rate (ORR) coincides with the condition CV = 1, where the noise CV is the ratio of standard deviation to mean of first passage time [5]. The optimality for other resetting time distributions were also studied [6]. First passage to a target on the other hand can also be regulated by tuning the spatial potential under which diffusion happens. When both potential bias and resetting work together, the former may render the latter strategy irrelevant at a point \u2014 this leads to transitions between phases with or without benefit of resetting [19, 21\u201327].\nFor generic spherically symmetric potentials V (R) = kRn and k ln(R/a) in any dimension d, the continuous transition point kc where ORR vanishes was exactly solved for various cases [25] \u2014 it was shown that kc \u223c dR\u2212n0 for the power-law potential (where R0 is the resetting radius) and kc \u223c d for the logarithimic potential, at large d. Various studies showed that the optimal resetting rate vanishing transition (ORRVT) has similarities to usual phase transitions \u2014 the mean first\n\u2217 saeedmalik@iitb.ac.in \u2020 dibyendu@phy.iitb.ac.in\npassage time (MFPT) is analogous to free energy and ORR is analogous to an order parameter [21, 23, 25]. A Landau like theory for MFPT as a function of ORR was developed [21, 23]. In particular, the possibility of discontinuous transitions of ORR, and continuous tri-critical point (TCP) was demonstrated in [23]. A natural question is which factors influence the nature of the transition, i.e continuous or discontinuous. The models that we study in this paper show that increase in the number of absorbing boundaries play a crucial role in giving rise to discontinuous transitions. This is reminiscent of switch from continuous to discontinuous transition in equilibrium q-state Potts model with increasing q [28].\nIn the context of a barrier crossing problem [29, 30] relevant to chemical reactions, the usefulness of resetting and associated ORRVT was studied in [21, 26, 27]. The latter studies focused on the question of the first passage to a hill top, starting from an adjacent valley. Yet if one considers a magnetic system in which the magnetization +m0 has to evolve to \u2212m0, the initial state and the final target are both at valleys seperated by a potential barrier which is to be crossed. Such a problem with resetting has not been studied earlier. We study this problem analytically in this paper using various models. One model deals with a Brownian particle in a piecewise linear potential which is tentlike, while another model deals with a magnetic system evolving at a fixed temperature and magnetic field under a Landau-like quartic potential. We show that the left-right asymmetry of the potential wells in these models, play a crucial role in determining the number of transitions in the parameter space and the type of transition.\nThis article is organized as follows. In section 2, we define four models based on the shapes of the potentials and the type of boundary conditions. In section 3, we discuss the methods used to study the transitions of ORR. In section 4, we present our results on ORRVT in two models in which only continuous transition (CT) arise. In section 5, we study the other two models where discontinuous transition (DT) and TCPs arise. Finally, we conclude in section 6.\nar X\niv :2\n20 2.\n03 76\n6v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nta t-\nm ec\nh] 8\nF eb\n2 02\n2\n2"

            "text": "In this article, we explore the role of the shape of the potential and the boundary conditions which give rise to rich diversity of transitions demarcating the phases where resetting is beneficial or a hindrance. We study four different models in this paper, which are shown in Fig.(1). In all these models the potential has a nonmonotonic shape with a hill in between two valleys \u2014 a new feature in comparison to the earlier studies.\nIn Model-I and Model-III (Fig.(1a, 1c)) we have a diffusing particle subjected to a tent potential V (x) over x \u2208 [0, L] given by the Eq.(1):\nV(x) = { v1(x\u2212 xm), x \u2264 xm, \u2212v2(x\u2212 xm) x \u2265 xm.\n(1)\nwhere the linear segments of slopes v1 and \u2212v2 are separated by a peak at xm. The values of the slopes determine the depth of the valleys formed at the boundaries u = 0 and at u = 1 (where u is the scaled length x/L). The particle position is stochastically reset to its initial position x0 \u2208 (0, L) at a constant rate r. Since our main attention is to study the first passage problems we have to suitably define the target as an absorbing boundary (AB). In Model-I the left boundary at u = 0 is an AB while the right boundary at u = 1 is a reflecting boundary (RB) (i.e V (x) = \u221e for x \u2265 L). In contrast in Model-III we have two targets at u = 0 and u = 1 both of which serve as AB \u2014 the first passage is achieved when the particle arrives at any one of them for the first time. We would see below that the seemingly innocuous change of the nature of the right boundary at u = 1 makes the Model-III have a completely different phase diagram compared to Model-I. We note that for v1 < 0 and v2 < 0 (i.e. a valley at xm) with no RB but only an AB, our Model-I becomes identical to the one studied in [26].\nIn Model-II and Model-IV the position x of the diffusing particle represents the magnetization state of a magnetic system. The potential V (x) has a mean field Landau form given by\nV (x) = x4 \u2212 bx2 \u2212 cx (2)\nwhere b = 6(Tc\u2212T )Tc represents the reduced temperature (deviation from the critical temperature Tc) and c = 12hTc is the reduced magnetic field. In the symmetric case of c = 0 (zero external field) the minima of the po-\ntential are at x = \u00b1 \u221a\nb 2 and the maximum is at x = 0.\nWe define a scaled magnetization u = x \u221a 2\u221a b . In all our studies the system is confined to the domain u \u2208 [\u22121, 1], even when the potential is asymmetric (|c| > 0). Note that in the asymmetric case (|c| > 0) the maximum is shifted from the location u = 0 and the minima are not at u = \u00b11 \u2014 instead their locations may be solved from the cubic algebraic equation: V \u2032 (x) = 4x3\u22122bx\u2212c = 0. The system is stochastically reset to its initial magnetization u0 \u2208 (\u22121, 1) at a constant rate r. In Model-II\nthe target for the first passage is the negative magnetization state u0 = \u22121 achieved by an AB condition while u0 = 1 serves as RB. In Model-IV both positive and negative magnetization states u0 = \u00b11 are ABs and serve as targets for the first passage. In both the models it would be interesting to see whether resetting strategy helps to reach the target magnetization state(s) at various values of the reduced temperature b and magnetic field c. Note that with increasing b (lower temperatures) the barrier height increases making the first passage more challenging. In such situations the asymmetry introduced by the magnetic field as well as stochastic resetting may help reach the target(s) \u2014 explicit study below will show where the field renders the resetting strategy ineffective.\nFor all the four models the stochastic process is described by the forward Chapman-Kolmogorov equation\n\u2202P\n\u2202t = D\n\u22022P \u2202x2 + \u2202[V \u2032(x)P ] \u2202x \u2212 rP + r\u03b4(x\u2212 x0), (3)\nwhere P \u2261 P (x, t|x0) is the probability of finding the particle at position (or magnetization) x at time t starting from x0 at time t = 0 i.e. with initial condition P (x, 0|x0) = \u03b4(x \u2212 x0). Here r is constant rate of resetting to the initial position x0 and D is the diffusion constant. In addition, there are specific boundary conditions relevant to the different models. In this paper, we would not be using the forward formalism, but the backward stochastic formalism which is more suitable for obtaining the properties related to the first passage. In the following, we would discuss the backward master equation for survival probability and the general method of finding ORRVT for the models.\n3"

            "text": "In general for any stochastic process with resetting, it was shown in [5], that the MFPT may be expressed in\nterms of the Laplace transform F\u0303 (s) of the distribution of the first passage time (FPT):\n\u3008Tr\u3009 = 1\u2212 F\u0303 (r) rF\u0303 (r)\n(4)\nWhen one is close to ORRVT the optimal resetting rate r\u2217 may be assumed to be small \u2014 this is certainly true for continuous critical and tri-critical transitions and may be a reasonable approximation for discontinuous ones. In such a case, expanding mean \u3008Tr\u3009 in a Taylor series in r [21, 23] is a good starting point:\n\u3008Tr\u3009 = a0 + a1r + a2r2 + a3r3 +O(r4) (5)\nThis is reminiscent of Landau theory for free energy as a function of the order parameter [31]. The coefficients in Eq.(5) were derived [21, 23] in terms of the moments of the FPT without resetting: a0 = \u3008T \u3009, a1 = \u3008T \u30092 \u2212 \u3008T 2\u3009 2 , a2 = 1 6 \u3008T\n3\u3009 + \u3008T \u30093 \u2212 \u3008T \u3009\u3008T 2\u3009 and a3 = \u2212 \u3008T 4\u3009 4! + \u3008T 3\u3009\u3008T \u3009 3 + \u3008T 2\u30092 4 \u2212 3\u3008T 2\u3009\u3008T \u3009 2 + \u3008T \u3009\n4. In this limiting expansion (Eq.(5)), a0 and a3 must be positive to ensure positivity of \u3008Tr\u3009 at both vanishing r and large r respectively. The sign of the remaining coefficients a1 and a2 decide the type of the ORRVT as we discuss below; although such a discussion may be found in [23] we provide the following for the ease reading.\nIf a1 or a2 or both are negative \u3008Tr\u3009 will be minimum at an optimal rate r = r\u2217 which may be located by setting \u2202\u3008Tr\u3009\u2202r |r=r\u2217 = a1 + 2a2r\u2217+ 3a3r 2 \u2217 = 0. This leads to\nr\u2217 = a2 3a3\n[\u221a 1\u2212 3a1a3 a22 \u00b1 1 ]\n(6)\nWhen a1 \u2264 0 and a2 > 0 there is a possibility of a CT by changing a control parameter \u03bb (which may be u0 or v2 or c in the different models defined above) at a critical point \u03bb = \u03bbc. By setting a1 = 0 the following important condition is obtained which is very useful to locate the critical point analytically:\nAt \u03bbc : \u3008T 2\u3009 = 2\u3008T \u30092 and \u3008T 3\u3009 > 6\u3008T \u30093 (7)\nNear the transition as a1 \u2192 0\u2212, we may write a1(\u03bb) = a1(\u03bbc) + a \u2032\n1(\u03bbc)(|\u03bbc \u2212 \u03bb|) + O(\u03bbc \u2212 \u03bb)2 with a1(\u03bbc) = 0. This implies r\u2217 \u2248 |a1|/2a2 (from Eq.6 considering the root with negative sign for which r\u2217 \u2192 0), and we have r\u2217 \u2248 |\u03bbc \u2212 \u03bb|\u03b2 with \u03b2 = 1. Note that this exponent with which ORR vanihes is in contrast to \u03b2 = 1/2 in the mean field Landau theory of magnetic phase transition [31].\nA special situation arises when a1 \u2192 0\u2212 and a2 \u2192 0+. In such a case, the quantity a1/a 2 2 \u2192 \u221e which\nimplies r\u2217 \u2248 \u221a |a1|/3a3 (from Eq.6 for the root with the negative sign). Again assuming a1 \u221d |\u03bbc \u2212 \u03bb| we have r\u2217 \u2248 |\u03bbc\u2212\u03bb|\u03b2 with \u03b2 = 1/2. This is again in contrast to \u03b2 = 1/4 for a TCP in Landau theory of phase transition [31]. At this TCP, \u03bb = \u03bbtc, the conditions a1 = 0 and a2 = 0 gives:\nAt \u03bbtc : \u3008T 2\u3009 = 2\u3008T \u30092 and \u3008T 3\u3009 = 6\u3008T \u30093 (8)\nThe possibility of DT in ORR arises when a1 > 0 and a2 < 0. For such a transition at \u03bb = \u03bbf one has a discontinuous jump of r\u2217 from a value rf > 0 for \u03bb\u2212f to r\u2217 = 0 for \u03bb + f . The DT happens when \u3008Tr\u3009|r=0 = \u3008Tr\u3009|r=rf , and \u2202\u3008Tr\u3009 \u2202r |r=rf = 0. If the discontinuous jump in the \u201corder parameter\u201d r\u2217 at ORRVT is small, using the Landau expansion (Eq. 5), these conditions lead to a1 + a2rf + a3r 2 f = 0 and a1 + 2a2rf + 3a3r 2 f = 0. Solving the latter equations we get:\nAt \u03bbf : rf = \u2212 a2 2a3 and a1 = a22 4a3\n(9)\nUsing the above Eq.(9), one may obtain the jump in r\u2217 = rf as well as the location of the transition point \u03bbf , but only within the small jump approximation. Thus Eq.(9) gives approximate values and not exact ones as Eqn.(7) and (8). For accurate determination of the DT point and order parameter jump when it is large, studying \u3008Tr\u3009 (exact or numerical) is better.\nTo study the possible transitions completely we need to know the moments of the FPT analytically exactly or at least numerically. The moments of the first passage probability distribution F (x0, t) are also related to the survival probability Q(x0, t) = \u222b\u221e t F (x0, t)dt for the process to survive till time t starting from x0, as follows:\n\u3008Tnr \u3009 = \u222b \u221e 0 tnF (x0, t)dt = n \u222b \u221e 0 tn\u22121Q(x0, t)dt\n\u2261 n(\u22121)n\u22121 \u2202 n\u22121q(x0, s)\n\u2202sn\u22121\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 s\u21920\n(10)\nwhere the second equality comes from integrating by parts and further demanding that Q(x, t) must decay faster than any power law in the limit t \u2192 \u221e. Thus the knowledge of \u3008Tnr \u3009 comes from the knowledge of Q(x0, t). Here q(x0, s) is the Laplace transform of Q(x0, t) with respect to t, i.e q(x0, s) =\u222b\u221e 0 dtQ(x0, t)e \u2212st. Note that the nth moment without resetting \u3008Tn\u3009 can be obtained by setting r = 0 in the expression of Eq.(10). The survival probability Q(x, t) for a general initial position x satisfies the backward differential Chapman-Kolmogorov equation (which is the counterpart of the forward Eq.(3)):\n\u2202Q\n\u2202t = D\n\u22022Q\n\u2202x2 \u2212 V \u2032(x)\u2202Q \u2202x \u2212 rQ+ rQ0, (11)\nHere Q \u2261 Q(x, t), Q0 \u2261 Q(x0, t), and the resetting position x = x0 has been kept distinct from the initial position x. On finding Q(x, t), one may replace\n4 x by x0 (the particular specified initial position) and solve for Q(x0, t). That further leads us to the moments through Eq.(10). The differential equation (11) is to be analytically or numerically solved for the given initial and boundary conditions. The initial condition is Q(x, 0) = 1. For an AB or a RB at x = xb the conditions are Q(xb, t) = 0 and Q \u2032 (xb, t) = 0 respectively.\nIn the following, we will discuss the methods to obtain q(x0, s) using Eq.(11) for the models defined above. For the tent-potential (Eq.(1)), the Eq.(11) is exactly solvable, but piecewise. However, for the more nontrivial Landau potential (Eq.(2)), we have to take resort to a numerical technique. Both are discussed below in Secs.[III A] and [III B]."

Even solving this numerically is a challenge because q(x, s) may be obtained by the numerical integration of the above equation for an assumed q(x0, s), which in turn is not known before q(x, s) is solved.\nWe handle the problem using the following method developed in Ref.[21]. First we make the Eq.(19) homogeneous by introducing a new function y(x, s) = q(x, s)\u2212 rq(x0,s)+1(r+s) , which looks as:\nD \u22022y(x, s)\n\u2202x2 \u2212 V\n\u2032 (x)\n\u2202y(x, s)\n\u2202x \u2212 (r + s)y(x, s) = 0 (20)\nNote that the absorbing boundary (AB) condition q(xAB, s) = 0 translates to y(xAB, s) = \u2212 rq(x0,s)+1(r+s) while reflecting boundary (RB) condition on q \u2032 (xRB, s) = 0 implies y \u2032 (xRB, s) = 0. Thus the unknown value q(x0, s) still lingers around through the AB condition. Next we proceed to define a scaled function\n5 y\u0303(x, s) = y(x, s)/y(xAB, s). The differential equation for y\u0303(x, s) is:\nd2y\u0303 dx2 = V \u2032 (x) D dy\u0303 dx + (r + s) D y\u0303 (21)\nIt is remarkable that the AB condition y\u0303(xAB, s) = 1 and hence the solution of Eq.(21) becomes free of the unknown input value q(x0, s). The RB condition is y\u0303 \u2032 (xRB, s) = 0. If one may find y\u0303(x, s) numerically using y\u0303(x0, s) one may obtain q(x0, s) from the following formula\nq(x0, s) = (y\u0303(x0, s)\u2212 1)y(xAB , s)\n= \u2212(y\u0303(x0, s)\u2212 1) rq(x0, s) + 1\n(r + s) ,\n=\u21d2 q(x0, s) = 1\u2212 y\u0303(x0, s) s+ ry\u0303(x0, s) .

After setting s = 0, we solve the Eq. (21) using NDSolve technique in Mathematica which includes ExplicitRungeKutta method to obtain y\u0303(x, 0). Further using the relation below (which follows from Eq.(22)) the mean time with resetting can be found from the numerical value of y\u0303(x0, 0):\n\u3008Tr\u3009 = q(x0, 0) = 1\u2212 y\u0303(x0, 0) ry\u0303(x0, 0) .

After applying these conditions the desired solutions of Eqn.(24) and (25) are shown in the App.[B 1].\nWhen x0 < xm, the Eq.(7) gets modified to \u3008T 2\u3009\u2212 = 2\u3008T \u30092\u2212, and when x0 > xm, we have \u3008T 2\u3009+ = 2\u3008T \u30092+. These conditions on the moments help us obtain the exact locations (2 \u2212 d surfaces) of the continuous ORRVT in the 3 \u2212 d parameter space of (v1, v2, u0). We show projected transition lines for fixed values of v1 in the v2\u2212 u0 plane in Fig.(2b) and Fig.(2d). We systematically vary v1 from negative values (Fig.(2a)), to high positive values (Fig.(2c)). In the scenario of Fig.(2a), we see (in Fig.(2b)) that for any v2 (positive or negative) on varying the scaled initial position u0 we have a single CT from the beneficial resetting phase (with r\u2217 > 0) to the unbeneficial phase (r\u2217 = 0) at some critical point u0c = u0c(v1, v2).\nOn the other hand for the scenario in Fig.(2c) for large positive v1 above a certain v \u2217 1 we have a new possibility. Within a certain range of v2 \u2208 (v2,min, v2,max), for a constant v2, we have multiple CTs as we vary u0. First r\u2217 > 0 changes to r\u2217 = 0 phase at u0c = u1, then there is a re-entrance to the r\u2217 > 0 phase at u0c = u2, and finally there is a transition to the r\u2217 = 0 phase at u0c = u3. Thus for the case of a deep valley near the AB (u0 = 0), corresponding to large v1, the advantage of resetting is crucially determined by the location of the resetting point u0. If one is near the AB or near the hill top it seems resetting is beneficial, but otherwise not.\nWhile for very large v1 and v2, since the peak at xm is sharp, it is expected that resetting would help in crossing the barrier and attaining first passage irrespective of the location u0 \u2014 hence we see r\u2217 > 0 for most values of u0. Likewise, for small values of v2, the peak is not so sharp, and so resetting is mostly unnecessary \u2014 as a result for most values of u0 we have r\u2217 = 0. Yet the existence of multiple regions where resetting is either beneficial or not, for v2 \u2208 (v2,min, v2,max), is rather interesting and not intuitively expected a prori.\nIs a DT possible in this model? To check this we derived the exact expressions of MFPT in the presence of resetting (see App.[B 1]) using Eqs. (15) and (16) and appropriate boundary and matching conditions \u2014 note that \u3008Tr\u3009\u2212 = q\u2212(x, s)|s=0 and \u3008Tr\u3009+ = q+(x, s)|s=0.

The critical lines in the c\u2212 u0 plane are shown in (b) and (d). The phase with r\u2217 > 0 is shown in purple color for b = 2 in\n(b) and b = 5.5 in (d). The values of cmax = \u22122.0, cmin = \u22127.1 and the three critical points corresponding to c = 4 are u1 = \u22120.92, u2 = \u22120.36 and u3 = 0.63. For b < b\u2217 = 3.95 (shown in red line), there is only a single critical point for a given c. The temperature dependent\ndiffusion constant used in this study is D = 6T/Tc.\n(b =constant), this leads to the ORRVT lines in the two-dimensional c\u2212u0 plane as shown in Figs.(3b) and (3d).\nIn Fig.(3a) we consider a shallow double potential corresponding to temperature closer to Tc. For c = 0 it is symmetric, while for c > 0 asymmetry develops. Note we have the AB and hence first passage at a location near the negative magnetization minimum. Corresponding to this scenario, we find that for any given field c \u2264 0, there is a single CT from the r\u2217 > 0 phase to the r\u2217 = 0 phase (see Fig.(3b)). The RB at u = 1 helps in the first passage by providing confinement so effectively that resetting strategy is not helpful, unless u0 is close to the AB where resetting helps to curtail long excursion away from the target.\nThe above scenario changes as temperature becomes low and consequently, potential wells deepen (see Fig.(3c)). For b > b\u2217 the critical transition line in the c \u2212 u0 plane has two turning points. As a result for a given magnetic field c \u2208 (cmin, cmax), there are three critical points u1, u2 and u3. For reset points u0 \u2208 (u1, u2) and u0 \u2208 (u3, 1), resetting does not help.\n7 On the other hand for u0 \u2208 (\u22121, u1) (near AB) and u0 \u2208 (u2, u3) (near the potential barrier) the resetting strategy is indeed beneficial and r\u2217 > 0.\nNote that this model represents a realistic magnetic system, and at very low temperature T \u2192 0 (i.e. b\u2192 6) barrier crossing is indeed a challenge to go from a positive magnetization state (u0 \u2208 (0, 1)) to the negative magnetization state u0 = \u22121. We see three things in Fig.(3d). At high magnetic field (c 0), the asymmetry in the potential can drive first passage efficiently such that resetting is unnecessary for most u0. On the other hand, for very low values of field c, resetting is a good strategy to additionally help in barrier crossing. Finally, at intermediate values of c, it is most interesting that resetting only helps if done to specific ranges of the initial magnetization.\nV.

            "text": "The mathematical procedure to study continuous ORRVT for this model with tent potential (piecewise linear V (x) and discontinuous V \u2032 (x)) has been discussed in Sec.[IV A]. To obtain the CT, one needs to solve for \u3008T \u3009\u2212, \u3008T \u3009+, \u3008T 2\u3009\u2212 and \u3008T 2\u3009+ without resetting using Eqn. (24) and (25) with matching conditions of MFPT and its derivative at x = xm. The boundary conditions in this model are different from Model-I. We have \u3008T \u3009\u2212|x=0 = 0, \u3008T 2\u3009\u2212|x=0 = 0, \u3008T \u3009+|x=L = 0, and \u3008T 2\u3009+|x=L = 0, at both x = 0 (i.e. u = 0) and x = L (i.e. u = 1). The exact expressions are shown in App.[B 2]. Setting \u3008T 2\u3009\u2212 = 2\u3008T \u30092\u2212 for x < xm and \u3008T 2\u3009+ = 2\u3008T \u30092+ for x > xm we get the surfaces of CT in the 3\u2212 d (v1, v2, u0) space.\nTo obtain the locations of the DTs which arise in this model, we solve Eqs. (15) and (16) for \u3008Tr\u3009\u2212 = q\u2212(x, s)|s=0 and \u3008Tr\u3009+ = q+(x, s)|s=0 with resetting, with suitable boundary and matching conditions (mentioned above). The results may be seen in App.[B 2]. Then we plot MFPT as a function of the resetting rate r and obtain the discontinuous jump in r\u2217, whenever they arise. We would like to point out that the jump in r\u2217 may be quite large, and the analytical formula obtained from small order parameter expansion (Eq.(9)) may not lead to numerically accurate answers (see Fig.(9) in App.[B 2]). Hence the procedure outlined above for DT is better.\nIf we set v2 = \u2212v1, then the potential looks as in Fig.(4a) and the problem becomes identical to the one studied in Ref.[23]. In Fig.(4b) for v1 = 15 and v2 < 0 as we vary u0, the ORR goes from a nonzero value to zero continuously at a critical point, and then undergoes a discontinuous jump at a second transition point. The DT line terminates at a TCP (marked in pink).

While for v2 < 0 the transitions in Fig.(5b), Fig.(5d) and Fig.(5f) remain similar to Fig.(4b), the ORRVT lines in the v2\u2212u0 plane start to develop completely new features for v2 > 0 regime. In Figs.(5a,5c,5e) we systematically reduce v1 from positive to negative values. In Fig.(5b) for v2 > 0, we see the appearance of the first new feature \u2014 the critical line on the left side splits by producing a pair of TCPs. As v1 is further lowered we see in Fig.(5d) and Fig.(5f) that the DT line connecting the TCPs stretch out in length. A second new feature in the Figs.(5b,5d,5f), is the appearance of an island like domain near the peak, where resetting is beneficial (r\u2217 > 0). Thus at a large enough value of v2 on varying u0, one would encounter four CT points.\nWe show the variation of the ORR value r\u2217 as a function of v2 and u0 for v1 = 2 in Fig.(6a). At high value of v2 we have marked the four transition points of ORR namely u1, u2, u3 and u4 which would be encountered if one varies u0 at v2 = 75. The regions of r\u2217 > 0 (shaded in color) are interspersed with regions of r\u2217 = 0 (shown in white). The discontinuous jump in r\u2217 is also shown over a stretch of the transition line near the left boundary. This first order stretch is terminated by two TCPs at the two ends, which is a rather rare feature. In Sec.[III], we have analytically established that the ORR behaves as r\u2217 \u221d [\u03bbc\u2212\u03bb]\u03b2 with \u03b2 = 1 near continuous transition and \u03b2 = 1/2 near TCP. We see in the Fig.(6a) that the approach of r\u2217 to the critical point (u1) looks linear (green curve), while that to the TCP is a curved line (pink). We explicitly check the exponent \u03b2 in Fig.(6b) in a log-log plot of r\u2217 vs. |u0c \u2212 u0|. At the CT point u0c = u1 we have \u03b2 = 1 and at the TCP u0c = uTCP we have \u03b2 = 1/2, as expected. The plots in Figs.(5) and (6) are for finite values of v2. A natural question is whether the scenarios presented for ORRVT lines continue to v2 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e or not.

The corresponding ORRVT lines in the v2 \u2212 u0 plane for different values of constant v1 are shown in (b), (d) and (f). In (b) on the left branch a pair of TCPs emerge (shown at v2 = 13.24, u0c = 0.185 and v2 = 18.46, u0c = 0.174 in the figure). In (d) and (f) the segment of DT line connecting the TCPs lengthen. An island of r\u2217 > 0 phase is present near the peak u0 = 0.5 in all the figures (b), (d) and (f). Here we used D = 1, xm = 0.5 and L = 1.\nthe condition \u3008T 2\u3009\u2212 = 2\u3008T \u30092\u2212 for x < xm at v2 \u2192 +\u221e we obtain the Eq.(B10) in App.[B 2]. This transcendental equation has three real solutions \u2014 for example for v1 = 2 the two critical points are u1 = 0.149, u2 = 0.376 and u3 = 0.5. Similarly, for x > xm setting \u3008T 2\u3009+ = 2\u3008T \u30092+ as v2 \u2192 \u221e we find that the critical point is u4 \u2192 1 independent of the value of v1 (see Eq. (B11) in App.[B 2]). Thus we have proved that four critical points continue to exist at v2 \u2192\u221e.\nOn the other hand, when v2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e by setting \u3008T 2\u3009\u2212 = 2\u3008T \u30092\u2212 for x < xm we obtain the transcendental Eq.(B12) in App.[B 2], which has only a single real solution \u2014 for example u0c = 0.260 for v1 = 2. In contrast \u3008T 2\u3009+ 2\u3008T \u30092+ and hence there is no solution for a CT. Thus for x > xm there is no CT, although we know there is a DT (from Fig.(5)).

In contrast the r\u2217 surface (shown in green) and the line in purple, go to r\u2217 = 0 continuously at the CT line and TCP point respectively. At v2 = 75 we have four CT points: u1 = 0.149, u2 = 0.449, u3 = 0.513 and u4 = 0.973. The value of r\u2217 rises from 0 at u2 reaches a peak and comes down and vanishes at u3. The CT line near u0 = 1 continues to a DT line through a TCP. In (b) we show in log-log plot of the power-laws that r\u2217 follows on approaching u0c = u1 and u0c = uTCP = 0.149 with exponents \u03b2 = 1 and 1/2 respectively."

In comparison in Model-IV, changing b affects the depth of both the valleys, while changing c affects the asymmetry of both the valleys simultaneously. Thus fine tuning the shape of the potential due to which the interesting features of the phase diagram in Fig.(5d) arise, becomes rather challenging to be achieved in Model-IV. One may obtain some of the results similar to Model-III, but not all, as shown below.\nWe obtain \u3008Tr\u3009 by following the method discussed in Sec.[III B] with the boundary conditions \u3008Tr\u3009 = 0 at u = \u00b11.

            "heading": "VI. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "In this paper, we studied different models of 1\u2212d diffusion, to understand whether the strategy of stochastic resetting is beneficial to reach target(s), in the presence of spatially varying potentials. In particular, we focused on potentials having a local peak or barrier with valleys on the two sides, flanked by reflecting or absorbing boundaries. The Models-I and III had piecewise linear potentials and hence were analytically exactly tractable. The Models-II and IV described the\ntime evolution of magnetization of a magnetic system subjected to stochastic resetting \u2014 the realistic quartic potential in this case permitted us to do numerical study.\nThe subtle interplay among features like the sharpness of the peak, the asymmetric depth of the valleys, and the presence of either RB or an AB, in the different models produced spatially interspersed domains where resetting is either beneficial or harmful. The boundary of these domains were maked by continuous or discontinuous ORRVT. In some of the models we found multiple tri-critical points.\nFor Model-I and Model-II with an AB and a RB, we obtain an interesting result that for intermediate sharpness of the peak, there are two neighborhoods (near the AB and near the peak) where resetting is beneficial and the remaining two neighborhoods where it is not. Consequently, there are three continuous transition points.\nFor Model-III with two ABs we find two novel features. The first is the existence of a discontinuous transition line flanked by two TCPs on the two sides. One TCP where the first order and a second order line meets has been found in earlier literature. Compared to that, the existence of two TCPs with a finite discontinuous transition segment is exotic. The second feature is the existence of four critical points and associated three domains in space (two near the ABs and another around the barrier) where resetting is beneficial.\nOne important understanding that we have from this work is that discontinuous ORRVT can only arise if we have more than one ABs. Additionally, there should be space dependent asymmetric potential in the region of confinement. Recall that, we had discontinuous transitions and TCPs in Models-III and IV and not in Models-I and II. The potential barriers enhance the necessity of resetting in their neighborhood.\nWe note that earlier studies on first passage with resetting from a valley to a hill top did not have such varied types and number of ORR vanishing transitions. What we have shown is that having the full spatial variation of the potential with both valleys and a barrier, richer aspects of ORRVT may arise.\nThe fact that we considered thermal evolution of the magnetic system in Model-II and IV with the appropriate temperature dependent diffusion constant, in between two resets, make the results obtained relevant to realistic systems. In particular it would be nice to do simulation of a many body Ising magnetic system with stochastic reset to confirm whether the results we obtained for an effective one body problem remain valid.\nAcknowledgement: DD would like to acknowledge SERB India (grant no.

These are used in calculations of Models-I and III.\nThe two piecewise backward equations (13) and (14) may be combined into a single equation as follows:\n\u2202Q(x, t)\n\u2202t = D\n\u22022Q(x, t)\n\u2202x2 \u2212 (v1 \u2212 (v2 + v1)\u0398(x\u2212 xm))\n\u2202Q(x, t)\n\u2202x \u2212 rQ(x, t) + rQ(x0, t) (A1)\nwhere, \u0398 represents Heaviside unit step function [32]. Integrating both sides of Eq. (A1) from x = xm \u2212 to x = xm + , where is an infinitesimally small positive number, we have:\u222b xm+ xm\u2212 dx \u2202Q(x, t) \u2202t = \u222b xm+ xm\u2212 dxD \u22022Q(x, t) \u2202x2 \u2212 \u222b xm+ xm\u2212 dx(v1 \u2212 (v2 + v1)\u0398(x\u2212 xm)) \u2202Q(x, t) \u2202x\n\u2212 \u222b xm+ xm\u2212 dxrQ(x, t) + \u222b xm+ xm\u2212 dxrQ(x0, t) (A2)\nSince Q(x, t) and \u2202Q(x,t)\u2202t are finite everywhere, it implies \u222b xm+ xm\u2212 Q(x, t)dx = 2 Q(xm, t)\u2192 0, \u222b xm+ xm\u2212 dx \u2202Q(x,t) \u2202t =\n2 \u2202Q(xm,t)\u2202t \u2192 0 and \u222b xm+ xm\u2212 dxQ(x0, t)\u2192 0.

small order parameter approximation may not be very accurate. In Fig.(9), we show \u3008Tr\u3009 vs. r for a certain DT \u2014 while the exact value of \u2206r\u2217 = 17.5, the value from the formula in Eq.(9) is 10.032 (marked as red dot on r-axis in Fig.(9)). So numerical method is better to find DT than approximate analytical formula in Eq.(9).\nNumber of continuous transitions in Model-III for a fixed value of v1 and v2 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e: At v2 \u2192 \u221e and any given v1 for x < xm = 0.5, the condition of CT \u3008T 2\u3009\u2212 = 2\u3008T \u30092\u2212 yields the following algebraic equation\n16\nfor u0c:\nev1u0c(3v1u0c \u2212 0.75v1 \u2212 1)(1\u2212 e0.5v1) = ev1u0c(v1u0c + 2)\u2212 0.5v1e2v1u0c\n+ e0.5v1(v1(2u 2 0c \u2212 u0c + 0.75)\u2212 4u0c + 1) + 2u0c \u2212 1\u2212 u0c(0.5\u2212 u0c)2 \u2212 2ev1v1u20c\n(B10)\nThe above equation has three real solutions of u0c indicating three CTs. For x > xm = 0.5 the corresponding equation obtained from \u3008T 2\u3009+ = 2\u3008T \u30092+ is:\nu0c \u2212 1 = 0 (B11)\nwhich leads to the solution of u0c = 1. Thus in total for the limit v2 \u2192\u221e there are four CTs. For v2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e the transition condition is \u3008T 2\u3009\u2212 = 2\u3008T \u30092\u2212 for x < xm = 0.5 and leads to:\nev1u0c(e0.5v1(2\u2212 v1(3u0c \u2212 1))\u2212 1) = ev1v1u0c(1\u2212 0.5v1u0c) + e0.5v1(v1(1\u2212 u0c) + 2)\u2212 e2v1u0c\n(B12)\nThe above equation has a single real solution of u0c. For x > xm = 0.5 the condition for CT, \u3008T 2\u3009+ = 2\u3008T \u30092+, is never satisfied as \u3008T 2\u3009+ 2\u3008T \u30092+ even for finite v2 < 0. We know that in this region there is a DT but no CT. Thus in the limit v2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e there is only one CT.\n[1] M. R. Evans and S. N. Majumdar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 160601 (2011). [2] M. R.
