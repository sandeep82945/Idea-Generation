Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between March and November 2021, with 54 infants of both sexes aged between 1 and 12 months. Twenty-seven infants born from mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy composed the COVID19 group, whereas infants born from mothers not exposed to COVID-19 composed the control group. Medical records and child health booklets provided neonatal and prenatal data. The Survey of Wellbeing of Young Children screened the risk of global developmental delay during a phone interview or home visit. Chi-squared, Mann\u2013Whitney test, and binary logistic regression were applied. Results: The risk of motor developmental delay was identified in 15 infants (12 in the COVID-19 group), while 36 were at risk of behavioral alteration (22 in the COVID-19 group). The COVID-19 group presented a 6.3-fold risk of motor developmental delay. Motor developmental delay was also significantly associated with socioemotional alterations (odds ratio = 6.4, p = 0.01). Regarding families of infants in the COVID-19 group, 63% of the mothers presented risk of depression, 51.9% risk of substance abuse, 40.7% risk of food insecurity, and 7.4% risk of domestic violence. The inflexibility subscale of the survey was a statistically relevant variable for the socioemotional domain. Conclusion: Infants born from mothers with COVID-19 were at high risk of motor developmental delay and socioemotional alterations. Although, this study fills an important gap in the literature regarding the influence of maternal exposure to COVID-19 on infant development, new studies screening families with infants at risk of developmental delay may significantly impact maternal and child health-related indicators, such as physical health, emotional development and social behavior.

This survey monitors the risk of developmental-behavioral disorders by assessing multiple domains of infant well-being.10\nCognitive, language, and motor development were assessed using the SWYC milestones,11 while the BPSC assessed behavioral and emotional symptoms. The section regarding family questions assessed parental depression, violence, substance abuse, and food insecurity. Questions related to parental concerns about infant behavior, learning, or development were also asked.12\nThe SWYC milestones and BPSC were classified according to total scores.12 Development was classified as \u201cneeds review\u201d (scores lower than the minimum for the age of infants) or \u201cappears to meet age expectations\u201d (higher than the minimum for the age of infants).

The interleukin-6, the main mediator involved in the inflammatory response, in high concentrations generates fetal neuroinflammation and microglial activation with long-term effects on neurodevelopment.16,17 This biological response to stress conditions at a cellular level may increase DNA damage,2,16 causing alterations associated with a major risk of chronic diseases or motor,6 cognitive,7 and neurological development.18\nAlthough studies investigating the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have not reported evidence of vertical contamination from mothers to infants,19,20 the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy may cause the same immune activation with long-term effects, since brain development is a dynamic process that extends into adolescence.16 In addition, factors such as maternal and perinatal experiences, social isolation, exposure to viral infections, and maternal depression and illness may also contribute to altered growth and child development.3,21,22\nMost families in the COVID-19 group were at risk of food insecurity. Shonkoff et al23 suggested that poverty and food insecurity were risk factors for adverse outcomes in childhood (eg, impaired motor and cognitive performance in the early childhood).23 Food insecurity might influence the fetal and brain development, via indirect effects through the mother, since the calories and nutrients required for fetal growth are transferred from the mother, dependent on maternal food intake and influenced by maternal microbiota.24 Microbes play an essential role in fetal development, because the maternal microbiota colonizes the newborn\u2019s body during a time when the brain is being shaped by key developmental processes.24\nMoreover, food insecurity may reflect low socioeconomic levels, which harms the well-being, socioemotional, cognitive, and language development of children and adolescents.25 A low socioeconomic level also leads to\nInternational Journal of Women\u2019s Health 2023:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S389291 DovePress\n471\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nenvironmental restrictions and poor sensory and motor stimuli for infants.26 In this context, an appropriate interaction between biological and environmental factors within a favorable family context improves infant development.27\nAccording to our results, other environmental factors investigated through SWYC forms, such as substance abuse, family violence and parental depression, may have influenced the neurodevelopmental outcomes. Parental substance abuse contributes to impaired intrauterine and infant development (eg, poor motor and cognitive outcomes and socioemotional and learning difficulties) and increases the chances of long-term intellectual disability28 and adolescence and adulthood depression.4 Nair et al29 observed that cumulative environmental factors (eg, maternal depression, domestic and non-domestic violence, number of family members, lack of shelter, incarceration, partner absence, psychological status, and severity of dependence) in infants born from mothers with substance abuse issues led to cumulative negative effects on motor development and high risk of maternal negligence and childhood abuse.29\nOur results also indicated that most infants lived with mothers at risk of depression. Recent studies indicated anxiety, depression, and maternal stress as regulatory factors influencing neurodevelopmental outcomes in the fetal programming process.30,31 Infants born from mothers with depression also presented a high risk of cognitive and motor delay and negative behavior disorders in adulthood.30,31 Studies using animal models showed a direct relationship between altered development and behavior and cortisol levels;32,33 the latter can be intensified by lack of social support.34\nFurthermore, stressful situations during the prenatal period, even when isolated (eg, snowstorms, hurricanes, and other natural disasters), might affect the cognitive and socioemotional development of infants in the long term.35,36 Thus, the pandemic-related stress experienced by mothers during pregnancy can act as a risk factor for changes in child development, especially when associated with other negative variables, such as maternal illness, inadequate support network, food insecurity and domestic violence.29,37 Therefore, birth during the COVID-19 pandemic, even without maternal infection, can be associated with regulatory problems related to sleep and child irritability.38\nBased on this background, Gabbard39 demonstrated that developmental disorders were associated with hormonal and biochemical alterations caused by environmental factors and gene expression. Jiang et al40 also showed that inflammatory cascades due to psychosocial stress may affect the behavioral and neurological development of fetuses and infants exposed to adverse situations in childhood.\nAlthough this study highlights the main factors related to the global development of children exposed to maternal illness, it is not free of limitations. The COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation hindered an outpatient assessment, so a screening questionnaire applied via phone was an alternative to monitor and carefully assess infants. Also, other conditions in conjunction with COVID-19 could not be paired between the samples and the inclusion criteria restricted our sample size. Additionally, the infants included in our sample were not tested for COVID-19, because in Brazil, during the time this study, only the symptomatic subjects were being tested.\nThus, we suggest that the future longitudinal studies monitoring the development of these infants be carried out with predictive developmental scales, as Bayley-III, as they can track not only the development of infants at risk but of all babies born in conditions as peculiar as the pandemic and social isolation. Further, longitudinal studies with larger samples should investigate neuromotor outcomes and consider the biopsychosocial model and biological aspects to interpret findings related to developmental delay.41\nNevertheless, in the Northeast of Brazil, this is the first study assessing the risk factors of socioemotional and motor delay in infants born from mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy. The Northeast Region has many social inequalities even between areas of the same city42 and the development of a Brazilian infant can be impaired by environmental deprivation.\nConsidering the existence of a direct relationship between socioeconomic conditions, biological factors and neurodevelopmental outcomes, it is clear that this study fills an important gap in the literature regarding the influence of maternal exposure to COVID-19 on infant development. Maternal illness may predispose alterations in child development, mainly if associated with risk factors, while the environmental context lived by the mother (eg, prolonged social isolation and psychosocial vulnerability) may negatively impact infant motor and socioemotional development.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S389291 DovePress International Journal of Women\u2019s Health 2023:15 472\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"
