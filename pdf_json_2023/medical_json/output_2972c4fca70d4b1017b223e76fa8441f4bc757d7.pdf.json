    "abstractText": "Memristors have been considered to be more efficient than traditional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) devices in implementing artificial synapses, which are fundamental yet very critical components of neurons as well as neural networks. Compared with inorganic counterparts, organic memristors have many advantages, including low-cost, easy manufacture, high mechanical flexibility, and biocompatibility, making them applicable in more scenarios. Here, we present an organic memristor based on an ethyl viologen diperchlorate [EV(ClO4)]2/triphenylaminecontaining polymer (BTPA-F) redox system. The device with bilayer structure organic materials as the resistive switching layer (RSL) exhibits memristive behaviors and excellent long-term synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the device\u2019s conductance states can be precisely modulated by consecutively applying voltage pulses between the top and bottom electrodes. A three-layer perception neural network with in situ computing enabled was then constructed utilizing the proposed memristor and trained on the basis of the device\u2019s synaptic plasticity characteristics and conductance modulation rules. Recognition accuracies of 97.3% and 90% were achieved, respectively, for the raw and 20% noisy handwritten digits images from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset, demonstrating the feasibility and applicability of implementing neuromorphic computing applications utilizing the proposed organic memristor.",

            "text": "In the big data era, huge volumes of data with much irregularity are rapidly generated every day, which is becoming a big challenge for information processing systems [1\u20133]. Recently, emerging neuromorphic computing methodologies, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), have attracted much attention due to their abilities to imitate the functions of synapses and neurons of the human brain and to deal with tricky tasks involving big data [4\u20136]. Numerous studies have also demonstrated their successful application in a wide range of fields in relationship with big data, such as computer vision (CV), pattern recognition, and natural language processing (NLP) [7\u20139]. However, the existing neuromorphic computing hardware platforms, including the General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) and application-specific accelerators such as Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) [10], are mainly designed on the basis of the traditional von Neumann architecture, where the computation and memory units are physically separated from each other, inevitably incurring frequent data movement back and forth between them. Consequently, this leads to the memory wall problem and brings about a performance bottleneck and low-energy efficiency to the system [11,12]. The shortcomings are exposed more obviously\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 803. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13050803 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 803 2 of 12\nespecially when the von-Neumann-architecture-based systems are used to deal with dataintensive applications such as neuromorphic computing. As in the human brain, synapses are the fundamental and key elements of a neuromorphic system. The synapses in existing neuromorphic systems are usually realized using CMOS devices, hindering the design of synapses and neurons with a higher density in neuromorphic systems. Therefore, it is quite essential to explore novel devices beyond von Neumann computing paradigms to design more performance- and energy-efficient synapses, neurons, as well as neuromorphic computing systems. Recently, memristors have been widely used to design artificial synapses and neurons, owing to their numerous advantages such as such as nonvolatility, high density, low-power consumption, and CMOS compatibility [13\u201318]. The resistive switching and multiconductance state properties allow the memristor-based synapses and neurons to do in situ computing in an analogue fashion with the help of the Ohm\u2019s Law and Kirchhoff\u2019s Current Law (KCL), inherently fusing the functions of memory and computation into the identical devices [19]. As a result, the frequent data movement problem can be addressed, improving both the performance and energy efficiency of the system. Additionally, the nonvolatility of memristors enables the stored synaptic weights to be kept unchanged even when the system is powered off, which can further lower the overhead during a system initiation. Furthermore, when stimuli of appropriate amplitudes and widths are applied, biological synaptic behaviors such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), potentiation, and depression can be observed on memristors [20]. Afterwards, a neuromorphic computing system beyond the von Neumann paradigm could be established where memristors are utilized to construct artificial electronic synapses and neurons. Therefore, memristors are considered to be one of the most promising next-generation neuromorphic devices. Numerous reports [20\u201330] have broadly investigated and demonstrated the applicability of memristors in such fields. However, most of them employed memristors based on inorganic materials. For instance, memristors based on metal oxide materials such as HfOx or ZnO were used to realize artificial synapses in [20\u201322], while sulfide materials such as Ag2S or Cu2S were used in [23,24]. Additionally, other works [27\u201329] also employed memristors based on 2D materials to realize artificial synapses and neuromorphic computing systems. Compared with inorganic counterparts, memristors based on organic materials have many more strengths, including low cost, easy manufacture, high-mechanical flexibility, biocompatibility, and more importantly, tunable electronic properties [19,31,32]. This allows them to be applied in scenarios such as wearable devices or even skin-implantable systems. In this work, a two-terminal organic memristor using ethyl viologen diperchlorate [EV(ClO4)]2/triphenylamine-containing polymer (BTPA-F) as the resistive switching layer (RSL) is presented. The bilayer-structured RSL between two metal electrodes exhibits memristive behavior and excellent long-term synaptic plasticity, which is of great importance for artificial synapses and neurons. Additionally, the conductance states can be precisely modulated by applying appropriate voltage pulses, making it possible to design multilevelweight synapses using the device. A multilayer perception (MLP) neural network [33] was designed and implemented using the EV(ClO4)2/BTPA-F-based memristor to examine the feasibility of implementing neuromorphic computing systems employing the proposed device. By taking advantage of the nonvolatile and tunable conductance of the device and the KCL, the simulated hardware network is capable of storing synaptic weights and doing neuromorphic computing on identical devices, which can significantly improve the performance and lower the power of a neuromorphic computing system. The synaptic weights of the network were trained and modulated on the basis of the memristor\u2019s synaptic plasticity characteristics and conductance modulation rules. Recognition accuracies of 97.3% and 90% were achieved, respectively, for the raw and 20% noisy handwritten digits images from the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset [34]. Thus, the EV(ClO4)2/BTPA-F-based organic memristor is a promising candidate for neuromorphic computing applications.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 803 3 of 12"

The 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were conducted at 400 MHz on a Bruker 400 AVANCE III spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) with deuterated chloroform as solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as a standard chemical shift of zero. Weight-average (Mw) and number-average (Mn) molecular weights were recorded by a waters 2690 gel permeation chromatography (Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) unitizing polystyrene standards and elution with tetrahydrofuran solvent (THF, 1 mL/min). The UV-Visible absorption spectra characterization was measured in 10 \u00b5M solution on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Steadystate fluorescence spectra of the polymer devices were recorded on an Andor SR303iA/DU420A-BVF spectrofluorometer (Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK). Cyclic voltammetry (CH Instruments Inc., Austin, TX, USA) measurements were recorded in the tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4) solution of acetonitrile (0.1 M) under an argon atmosphere utilizing platinum gauze and Ag/AgCl as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively, in which a typical scan rate of 50 mV/s was used during the CV measurements. The cross-sectional images of the BTPA-F nanofilm as well as the BTPAF/EV(ClO4)2 bilayer structure was conducted on a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Kyoto, Japan). The I-V sweeps were measured by Agilent B1500 semiconductor analysis system (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) at room temperature. The deposition of the top electrode utilized the magnetron sputtering system at the Ar atmosphere. Further, we utilized the electron-rich polymer of BTPA-F that can accept the anion of electron deficiency (Figure 1a) and the electron deficiency molecule viologen as an anion acceptor (Figure 1b) to form the push and pull anion effect. Considering the solution ability of the viologen organic salt dissolving in the organic solvent due to its high molecule polarity, we dispersed them in the PEO polymer to generate the even viologen: PEO nanofilm. Under the outside field, the perchlorate in viologen can be stimulated to migrate to the BTPA-F polymer coordinating with the amino, thus forming the variation of the electronic transportation.

When the postsynaptic spike arrives before the presynaptic (\u2206t < 0), the synaptic weight change (\u2206W) will be positive, wherein the value of synaptic weight will increase gradually, indicating an LTP process. On the contrary (\u2206t > 0), the synaptic weight change will be negative wherein the value of synaptic weight will decrease gradually, indicating an LTD process. The synaptic weight retention performance of our device in response to temperature change is also examined in this work. The result shown in Figure 4c demonstrates that our device can tolerate a wide range of temperature without obvious synaptic weight loss, which allows the device to be applied in a wide range of temperature environment."

            "text": "The biological presynapse and postsynapse can be respectively mapped to the top and bottom electrodes of the memristor, and the conductance value corresponds to the synaptic weight. Applying pulse voltage on the memristive device can be used to replace the nerve stimulation signal of neurons. The characteristics of nerve stimulation signals corresponding to different synaptic functions can be simulated by changing the shape, frequency, duration, and other parameters of the pulse voltage. As shown in Figure 5a, a three-layer MLP neural network was designed and implemented utilizing the Ta/EV(ClO4)2/BTPAF/Pt memristor for the purpose of demonstration of the feasibility of our device in implementing neuromorphic computing systems. The supervised learning based on the backpropagation (BP) algorithm was employed to train the network using 60,000 images from the MNIST database, a standard benchmark widely used to gauge machine learning algorithms. The grayscale of the image is represented by the conductance value. According to the corresponding relationship between the pulse and the memristive state, the grayscale of the image in the database is mapped to the number of spike pulses that need to be applied. Each input image was scaled to 8 pixels by 8 pixels to match up the size of our custom network. Through cropping and bicubic interpolation downsampling methods, the effective information of the image is preserved under the condition of adapting the input quantity of the network. It is worth mentioning that the more integrated memristive network has more input features, thus achieving higher resolution image recognition. A total of 64 input neurons of the network corresponded to the total amount of pixels of one image, while 10 output neurons corresponded to 10 handwritten Roman numerals. The weights were updated during the learning process based on the experimental data sampled by testing on the Ta/EV(ClO4)2/BTPA-F/Pt synaptic memristor according to the LTP and LTD modulation rules. A dedicated crossbar array based on the presented memristor was then designed to simulate the custom neural network, as illustrated in Figure 5b. The top electrodes of the devices on an identical row were connected to a word-line (WL) while the bottom electrodes of the devices on an identical column were connected to a bit-line (BL). The top and bottom electrodes of each individual memristor device mimicked the pre- and postsynaptic neuron, respectively, while the bilayer-structured RSL of the device acted as the synapse. The custom MLP neural network consist of 5920 (80 rows \u00d7 74 rows) artificial synapses, each of which was initialized to the minimum conductance of the presented. The training dataset from MNIST was used in the training duration, with a mini-batch size of 60. As illustrated in Figure 5c, the network training was composed of two stages: feedforward inference and feedback weight update. The synaptic weight of each synapse was kept unchanged and used in each feedforward inference iteration and updated in each backward iteration by applying voltage pulses according to the LTP and LTD modulation\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 803 7 of 12\nrules of the device. The feedforward inference was performed layer by layer sequentially, as was the backward weight update. The input voltage vector for the first layer was a feature vector from the dataset, while the input vector for the subsequent layer was the output vector of the previous layer. The analogue weighted sum can be performed along bit-lines according to the Ohm\u2019s law and Kirchhoff\u2019s law [51,52], demonstrating that the in situ computing is enabled in the memristor array. The total current of each bit-line was the summation of the currents through each device in the same column, while each current was the product of the conductance and the corresponding voltage across the memristor. The input signal of hidden neurons can be derived from the Equation (2):\nIlj = 64\n\u2211 i=1 W lijV l i (2)\nwhere V li denotes the input voltage vector applied to the top electrodes of the synaptic devices, Ilj denotes the readout current vector from the bottom electrodes of the synaptic devices, while W lij denotes the weight matrix of layer l. Then, the current results were activated by a nonlinear sigmoid transfer function. The activated result of a hidden layer was transferred to the output neurons. The inference result was calculated by Equation (3):\nV l+1i = \u03c3(I l i ) =\n{ cIli , I l i > 0\n0, Ili \u2264 0 (3)\nwhere c is 800 V/A, which is a scaling factor matching the voltage range of the device. The resulting voltage elements exceeding 0.8 V were clipped to avoid changing the memristor state. V2 and V3 are the output signals of the second and third layers of the network, respectively. The forward propagation process ends at this point. Nanomaterials 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 12\nFigure 5.

We evaluated the electrical characteristics and memristive behaviors of the memristor by\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 803 10 of 12\napplying consecutive positive and negative voltage sweeps for conductance setting and resetting, and small voltages of \u00b1 0.2 V for current reading. The long-term potentiation and long-term depression properties together with the weight modulation rules were then investigated to verify the long-term plasticity of the device. At last, a three-layer artificial neural network was designed and implemented by customizing a synaptic crossbar array employing the presented memristor as the synapses. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and applicable of our device in implementing neuromorphic computing systems.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.Z.; investigation, J.Z. and X.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, J.Z., X.C., S.L., and Q.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.Z., X.C., S.L., Q.C., and G.L.; software, X.C.; visualization, X.C. and Q.C.; supervision, G.L.; funding acquisition, Q.C. and G.L.
