    "abstractText": "In a recent experiment, the out-of-plane surface susceptibility of a single-layer two-dimensional atom crystal in the visible spectrum has been measured. This susceptibility gives a measurable contribution to the reflectivity of two-dimensional materials. Here we provide a complete theoretical description of the reflective properties, considering incoming s and p polarized plane waves at any angle of incidence on the crystal, computing local, reflected and transmitted electromagnetic fields. We finally connect the microscopic polarizability to both the in-plane and the out-of-plane macroscopic surface susceptibilities.",

Galilei,\nUniversita\u0300 degli studi di Padova, via Marzolo 8, 35131 Padova, Italy 2 College of Physics, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, China.\n(Dated: January 18, 2022)\nIn a recent experiment, the out-of-plane surface susceptibility of a single-layer two-dimensional atom crystal in the visible spectrum has been measured. This susceptibility gives a measurable contribution to the reflectivity of two-dimensional materials. Here we provide a complete theoretical description of the reflective properties, considering incoming s and p polarized plane waves at any angle of incidence on the crystal, computing local, reflected and transmitted electromagnetic fields. We finally connect the microscopic polarizability to both the in-plane and the out-of-plane macroscopic surface susceptibilities.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTwo-dimensional (2D) crystals are the thinnest materials that can be produced [1, 2]. They are composed of only one atomic plane like graphene or BoronNitride [3, 4], or one molecular plane like transition metal dichalcogenides [5, 6]. This planar configuration make them highly anisotropic in the direction perpendicular to the crystal plane. For instance, they can have in-plane macroscopic dimensions [7\u201310] while keeping an out-ofplane thickness of the order of one atom. This particular geometry suggests that also their optical response should be anisotropic, at least in the vertical direction to the crystal plane. Ab-initio calculations indeed predict this anisotropy for a 2D crystal [11\u201313]. Notwithstanding the enormous progresses in thin films and 2D materials optical characterization [14\u201321], it turns out that a measurement of the out-of-plane optical constants of a 2D crystal is still a difficult task [22]. These materials are usually deposited on a substrate whose optical response is added to that of the monolayer. This is enough to hide the contribution coming from the out-of-plane optical constants of the single-layer crystal [22]. In thin-film optics, the sensitivity of a measurement to vertical anisotropy is dependent on the path length of the light through the film, which is extremely limited when we deal with these atomically thin crystals [22]. As a consequence, optical experiments of monolayers, deposited on some substrate, have access only to the in-plane optical constants of the samples that are studied [6, 14\u201316, 19\u201321, 23]. Only recently an experiment successfully measured the out-of-plane optical constants of 2D crystals, namely graphene and monolayer MoS2 [24]. The substrate contribution was eliminated by a complete immersion of these single-layer crystals in a transparent polymer. Experimental data say that the out-of-plane surface susceptibility (\u03c7\u22a5) is a measurable and finite quantity different from the in-plane surface susceptibility (\u03c7\u2016), while the\n\u2217 michele.merano@unipd.it\nout-of-plane surface conductivity was zero within the experimental errors.\nOne might expect that a 2D crystal with atomic thickness along the vertical direction has a vanishing \u03c7\u22a5, being \u03c7\u22a5 a macroscopic quantity. Indeed some of the most cited papers about optics in 2D crystals assume a null \u03c7\u22a5 [25\u201328]. All the other papers describe the linear optical response of a monolayer assuming isotropy even in the vertical direction [6, 22, 23]. The aim of this work is to prove that \u03c7\u22a5 is indeed finite and different from \u03c7\u2016 in a rigorous analytical way.\nWe will start with a microscopic description of a 2D crystal, as done in Ref. [29], and then will connect it to the macroscopic one, by means of a procedure similar to that used in Ref. [30]. The results in Refs. [29, 30] were limited to normal incidence, therefore, they had no access to \u03c7\u22a5.\n2"

The phase in the prefactor is given by\nPmn = ei(\u03c9t\u2212k rmn) e\u2212ik\u03b4mn (2)\nwith a phase shift \u03b4mn whose modulus is the distance of the point (rmn cos\u03d1mn, rmn sin\u03d1mn, 0) from the plane wave crossing the origin of the reference frame with equation s\u0302 \u00b7 ~r = 0. As a result, in quite general terms, the phase shift \u03b4mn can be written as\n\u03b4mn = rmn sin \u03b8 cos(\u03d1mn + \u03c6) (3)\nThe components of ~Emn are, therefore,\nEmn,x = ei\u03c9t\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 r3mn e\u2212ik (rmn+\u03b4mn)\n{ px [( 3 cos2 \u03d1mn \u2212 1 ) (1 + ik rmn) + k 2r2mn sin 2 \u03d1mn ]\n(4)\n+ py cos\u03d1mn sin\u03d1mn [ 3(1 + k rmn)\u2212 k2r2mn ]}\nEmn,y = ei\u03c9t\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 r3mn e\u2212ik (rmn+\u03b4mn)\n{ py [( 3 sin2 \u03d1mn \u2212 1 ) (1 + ik rmn) + k 2r2mn cos 2 \u03d1mn ]\n(5)\n+ px cos\u03d1mn sin\u03d1mn [ 3(1 + k rmn)\u2212 k2r2mn ]}\nEmn,z = ei\u03c9t\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 r3mn e\u2212ik (rmn+\u03b4mn)pz\n[ k2r2mn \u2212 1\u2212 ik rmn ]\n(6)\nWithout loss of generality we will take \u03c6 = \u03c0/2 (see Fig. 1) so that the phase shift reduces to\n\u03b4mn = \u2212rmn sin \u03b8 sin\u03d1mn (7)\nSumming over \u03d1mn, the last terms in Eqs. (4), (5) are zero, since those terms are odd under \u03d1mn \u2192 \u03d1mn + \u03c0 for our choice of the reference frame. As a result the sum over the contributions to the local filed coming from all the dipoles is parallel to the dipole sitting at the origin. For the square lattice rmn = a \u221a m2 + n2, where a is the lattice parameter, and tan\u03d1mn = n/m, while for the triangular lattice rmn = a \u221a (m+ n/2)2 + 3n2/4 and tan\u03d1mn = \u221a 3n/(2m + n).

C0 is the static result already reported in our previous paper [29] (C0 \u2248 4.517 for the square lattice and C0 \u2248 5.517 for the triangular lattice) and C1 = \u22122\u03c0Na2, where N is the density of dipoles (N = 1/a2 for the square lattice, N = 2/ \u221a 3a2 for the triangular lattice). We notice that the \u03b8-dependence vanishes in the static limit, namely in the long-wavelength limit, k \u2192 0, and appears in the three field components with a 1/ cos \u03b8, cos \u03b8 and a combination of them\nf(\u03b8) = 1\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 cos \u03b8 = sin \u03b8 tan \u03b8. (12)\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the \u03b8-dependence in Eq. (11) is the same for either square and triangular lattices. Analogous checks have been performed to verify 1/ cos \u03b8 and cos \u03b8 in Eqs. (9) and (10) respectively. The local field at one site is due to the incident field and the contributions from the other oscillating dipoles. We has, therefore, to solve the following equation\n~Eloc = ~Ei +\n\u2032 \u2211\nm,n\n~Emn (13)\nWe can now easily find the local field ~Eloc from Eqs.

The polarization vector varies in time since ~Eloc \u221d ei\u03c9t, therefore, along the crystal plane, it gives rise to an in-plane surface electric current JPx , which is given by\nJPx = \u2202Px/\u2202t = i\u03c9Px = i\u03c9\u01eb0\u03b1NEloc,x (19)\nThis surface current generates a macroscopic electromagnetic field that propagates in two different directions.

We have, then, the following solutions\n\u03c7yy = 4\u03c0a3N\u03b1\n4\u03c0a3 \u2212 C0\u03b1 \u03c7zz =\n2\u03c0a3N\u03b1\n2\u03c0a3 + C0\u03b1\nHr\u2016\nHi =\nik\u03c7yy cos \u03b8\nik\u03c7yy cos \u03b8 + 2\nHr\u22a5 Hi = \u2212ik\u03c7zz sin \u03b8 tan \u03b8 ik\u03c7zz sin \u03b8 tan \u03b8 + 2\nHt\u2016\nHi =\n2\nik\u03c7yy cos \u03b8 + 2\nHt\u22a5 Hi = 2\nik\u03c7zz sin \u03b8 tan \u03b8 + 2 (36)\nThis finding is a very interesting result because it shows that our crystal has an isotropic in-plane surface susceptibility (\u03c7\u2016 = \u03c7xx = \u03c7yy) different from the out-of-plane susceptibility (\u03c7\u22a5 = \u03c7zz), namely we are dealing with an uniaxial crystal. We can also evaluate the ratio \u03c7\u22a5/\u03c7\u2016. Choosing the value of a = 0.26 nm, for atom polarizabilities \u03b1 typically varying in the range between 1 and 30 cm\u22123, the \u03c7\u22a5/\u03c7\u2016 ratio varies in between 0.93 and 0.1 (0.94 and 0.18) for a triangular lattice (for a square lattice). This values are of the same order of magnitude of what has been observed [24]. The full reflected field from the crystal is Hr = Hr\u2016 + Hr\u22a5 (see Fig. 3), so that we can finally derive the reflection coefficient for 2D crystals, rp = Hr/Hi, getting\nrp = ik\u03c7yy cos \u03b8 ik\u03c7yy cos \u03b8 + 2 \u2212 ik\u03c7zz sin \u03b8 tan \u03b8 ik\u03c7zz sin \u03b8 tan \u03b8 + 2 (37)\nWe compute now the radiation-reaction electric field acting on the dipole at the origin along the y and z directions\nERy = ikaC1\u03b1 cos \u03b8\n4\u03c0a3 Eloc,y = \u2212\n\u03b7Jy cos \u03b8\n2 (38)\nand\nERz = ikaC1\u03b1(sin \u03b8)\n2\n4\u03c0a3 cos \u03b8 Elocz = \u2212\nik(sin \u03b8)2\n2\u01eb0 cos \u03b8 Pz\n= \u2212 tan \u03b8 2\u01eb0 \u2202 \u2202y Pz = \u2212 tan \u03b8 2 JPz . (39)\nand we show that these macroscopic quantities correspond to the macroscopic fields generated by the oscillating dipoles. We can rewrite Eqs. (35) in terms of the electric fields\nEiy + Ery\u2016 = Ety\u2016 Eiz + Erz\u22a5 = Etz\u22a5\nEiy \u2212 Ery\u2016 = Ety\u2016 \u2212 2ERy Eiz \u2212 Erz\u22a5 = Etz\u22a5 \u2212 2ERz \u01eb0\u03c7yyEty\u2016 = Py \u01eb0\u03c7zzEty\u22a5 = Pz (40) which give the following solutions\nEry\u2016 = ERy Erz\u22a5 = ERz\nEty\u2016 = Eiy + ERy Etz\u22a5 = Eiz + ERz \u03c7yy = Py\n\u01eb0(Eiy + ERy ) \u03c7zz = Pz \u01eb0(Eiz + ERz )\n(41)\nWe can interpret these equations in the following way. The in-plane (out-of-plane) electric surface current JPy (JPz ) generates a macroscopic electromagnetic field propagating along the s\u0302 and s\u0302r directions. We identify ERy (ERz ) as the electric field component along the ydirection (z-direction) of this macroscopic field. From Eqs. (31)), we can write the first two equations on the left-hand-side of Eqs. (41) as\nHr\u2016 = \u2212 ERy \u03b7 cos \u03b8 = \u2212HR\u2016\nHt\u2016 = Hi + ERy \u03b7 cos \u03b8 = Hi +HR\u2016 (42)\nand the first two equations on the right-hand-side of Eqs. (41) as\nHr\u22a5 = ERz \u03b7 sin \u03b8 = HR\u22a5\nHt\u22a5 = Hi + ERz \u03b7 sin \u03b8 = Hi +HR\u22a5 (43)\nThe full reflected field (see Fig. 3) is, therefore,\nHr = \u2212HR\u2016 +HR\u22a5 (44)\nwhile the full transmitted field is given by the superposition of the incident field and the two macroscopic fields\n6 propagating in the s\u0302 direction (see Fig. 3), generated by the two currents,\nHt = Hi +HR\u2016 +HR\u22a5 (45)\nWe can finally derive the transmission coefficient, defined by tp = Ht/Hi, getting\ntp = 1\u2212 ik\u03c7yy cos \u03b8 ik\u03c7yy cos \u03b8 + 2 \u2212 ik\u03c7zz sin \u03b8 tan \u03b8 ik\u03c7zz sin \u03b8 tan \u03b8 + 2 (46)\nFinally the equations in the last line of Eqs. (41) provide the macroscopic electric fields Ey and Ez . They are related to the radiation-reaction electric fields. Along the y-direction we have Ey = Ei cos \u03b8 +ERy while along the z-direction we have Ez = Ei sin \u03b8 + ERz ."

            "text": "We have shown that a 2D crystal, microscopically composed by atoms with an isotropic polarizability \u03b1, has both a macroscopic \u03c7\u2016 and a macroscopic \u03c7\u22a5 with \u03c7\u22a5 6= \u03c7\u2016 and \u03c7\u22a5 6= 0, in contrast to some theoretical models, generally used to derive reflection and transmission coefficients for these materials, which assume either a null \u03c7\u22a5 [25\u201328] or isotropy [6, 15, 16, 19, 23]. Moreover we have confirmed that \u03c7\u22a5 < \u03c7\u2016 and that the ratio \u03c7\u22a5/\u03c7\u2016 is compatible with experimental observations. Our microscopic theory provides both the local and the radiation-reaction fields when an incoming electromag-\nnetic plane wave shines on a 2D material. The radiationreaction fields coincide with the macroscopic fields scattered by the crystal, and they contribute to the reflected and the transmitted radiations. This analysis allows us, then, to derive the complete set of Fresnel coefficients and their dependence on the angle of incidence.\nIn particular we describe the reflection of an incident p wave, as obtained by the superposition of the scattered electromagnetic fields due to an in-plane electric and an in-plane magnetic surface currents. The first current is related to a macroscopic surface polarization oscillating in the crystal plane, the second one to a macroscopic surface polarization oscillating perpendicularly to the crystal plane. Combining the boundary conditions for these two currents we provide a simple expression for the macroscopic electric fields along the y and z directions, which turn to be the sum of the related components of the incident field with the radiation-reaction field along the same directions. For an s polarized wave, only an inplane electric surface current is involved, so the reflected field is given by the scattered electromagnetic field due to only an in-plane current and the macroscopic electric field is the sum of the incident field plus the radiation reaction field."
