Associated changes included significant oxygen desaturation (2.9 \u00b1 2.5 and 2.3 \u00b1 2.2%, respectively) and insufficient increment of heart rate during the test (24.9 \u00b1 17.5 and 28.2 \u00b1 12.0 bpm) that resulted in low reached percent of individual maximum heart rate (61.1 \u00b1 8.1 and 64.3 \u00b1 8.2%). Automatic clusterization of the study cohort by the 6MWD% changes has allowed to identify the subgroup of patients with poor \u201clow base\u2014 low increment\u201d trajectory of spontaneous post-discharge recovery that were characterized by younger age (38.2 \u00b1 11.0 vs. 54.9 \u00b1 12.1, p < 0.001) but more extensive pulmonary involvement by CT (43.7 \u00b1 8.8 vs. 29.6 \u00b1 19.4%, p = 0.029) and higher peak ESR values (36.5 \u00b1 9.7 vs. 25.6 \u00b1 12.8, p < 0.001). Predictors of poor recovery in multivariate logistic regression analysis included age, peak ESR, eGFR, percentage of pulmonary involvement by CT, need for in-hospital oxygen supplementation, SpO2 and mMRC dyspnea score pre-discharge, and history of hypertension.",

Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation is a mainstay of management of symptomatic post-COVID patients, and optimization of candidate selection might allow for more effective use of available resources.\nMethods: In order to study the natural dynamics and to identify predictors of physical functional recovery following hospitalization for COVID-19, 6 min walk test was performed pre-discharge in 176 patients (40% hypertensive, 53% female, mean age 53.2 \u00b1 13.5 years) with re-evaluation at 1 month.\nResults: Six min walk distance and the reached percent of predicted distance (6MWD%) were suboptimal at both visits\u2014396 \u00b1 71 m (68.7 \u00b1 12.4%) pre-discharge and 466 \u00b1 65 m (81.8 \u00b1 13.6%) at 1 month. Associated changes included significant oxygen desaturation (2.9 \u00b1 2.5 and 2.3 \u00b1 2.2%, respectively) and insufficient increment of heart rate during the test (24.9 \u00b1 17.5 and 28.2 \u00b1 12.0 bpm) that resulted in low reached percent of individual maximum heart rate (61.1 \u00b1 8.1 and 64.3 \u00b1 8.2%). Automatic clusterization of the study cohort by the 6MWD% changes has allowed to identify the subgroup of patients with poor \u201clow base\u2014 low increment\u201d trajectory of spontaneous post-discharge recovery that were characterized by younger age (38.2 \u00b1 11.0 vs. 54.9 \u00b1 12.1, p < 0.001) but more extensive pulmonary involvement by CT (43.7 \u00b1 8.8 vs. 29.6 \u00b1 19.4%, p = 0.029) and higher peak ESR values (36.5 \u00b1 9.7 vs. 25.6 \u00b1 12.8, p < 0.001). Predictors of poor recovery in multivariate logistic regression analysis included age, peak ESR, eGFR, percentage of pulmonary involvement by CT, need for in-hospital oxygen supplementation, SpO2 and mMRC dyspnea score pre-discharge, and history of hypertension.\nConclusion: COVID-19 survivors were characterized by decreased physical performance pre-discharge as assessed by the 6 min walk test and did not completely restore their functional status after 1 month of spontaneous recovery, with signs of altered blood oxygenation and dysautonomia contributing to the observed changes. Patients with poor \u201clow base\u2014low increment\u201d trajectory of post-discharge recovery were characterized by younger age but more extensive pulmonary involvement and higher peak ESR values. Poor post-discharge recovery in the study cohort was predictable by the means of machine learningbased classification model that used age, history of hypertension, need for oxygen supplementation, and ESR as inputs."

            "text": "COVID-19 pandemic continues to present a protracted challenge to the healthcare systems and economies worldwide. Despite a significant reduction in mortality as the result of global vaccination campaigns and natural evolution of prevailing SARS-CoV-2 types, concerns are being increasingly raised in relation to the high incidence of long-lasting symptoms among COVID-19 convalescents (1, 2). This scenario has been attributed several generic names (3\u20135), with \u201clong COVID\u201d being most frequently used. According to different sources, 5% to 48% patients continue to report at least one symptom persisting beyond 3 months after disease onset (2, 6), with the rate getting as high as 76% among those who required hospitalization and up to 81% after intensive care unit admission (7). An important aspect of this problem is also related to potentially debilitating effect of some of the typical long COVID sequelae that include dyspnea, fatigue, and signs of cognitive dysfunction (1, 2, 8).\nAssessment of the origin of physically limiting symptoms in the post-acute COVID-19 setting is frequently complicated due to significant heterogeneity of possible underlying mechanisms. The latter might include signs of pulmonary restriction and decreased diffusing capacity (9, 10), cardiac dysfunction (2, 11), and a significant share of unexplained cases, the rate of which is generally higher in non-severe COVID-19 convalescents (12).\nAs one of the consequences, to date no specific treatment has demonstrated beneficial effects for the prevention and treatment of long COVID-related dyspnea and fatigue (8, 13). The mainstay of post-acute management in these patients is presented by cardiopulmonary rehabilitation that has been shown to have positive effect on the dynamics of symptoms and functional status (14\u201316). At the same time, the number of convalescents typically exceeds the available programs capacity, and the real-life post-acute COVID-19 care would benefit from the possibility to identify the optimal candidates to enter supervised rehabilitation.\nAnother consequence of the described heterogeneity of long COVID physiology is the limited usability of parameters that specifically assess pulmonary or cardiac function for the monitoring of rehabilitation efficacy in the general cohort of post-acute patients. With availability, versatility, and extensive validation in a wide set of conditions being other important considerations, general physical performance assessment in the 6 min walk test (6MWT) (17\u201319) is a viable choice in this setting.\nThus, the objective of this study was to investigate the dynamics of spontaneous physical functional recovery as assessed by the 6MWT during 1\u00a0month follow-up after hospitalization for COVID-19 and to identify the pre-discharge predictors of poor improvement."

For all variables, descriptive statistics are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile range) for normally distributed and skewed continuous variables, respectively. Categorical variables are reported as counts (percentages). Cross-sectional comparisons of continuous variables were made using independent samples t-test for normally distributed parameters and Mann\u2013Whitney U-test for skewed variables; chi-square test was used to compare binary and categorical variables. Longitudinal comparisons were made using paired samples t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. p-values reported were calculated using two-sided Fisher\u2019s exact test, the differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. Cluster analysis was performed using k-means algorithm with 10-fold cross-validation. Logistic regression analysis was performed using a forward stepwise method; Somers\u2019 D, Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov statistic, and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis were used to assess the quality of regression models, and Wald p-value to assess significance of included predictors.\nUnsupervised machine learning (ML) approach was used to create classification models based on simple artificial neural networks (SANN). For each set of input variables, 500 predictive models were trained using the automated neural architecture search strategy and Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno optimization algorithm with subsequent automatic ranging of the obtained models by their predictive performance. The latter was assessed as percentage of correctly classified cases from the training, test and validation subsets that were obtained by random sampling of the study cohort in the 70:15:15 proportion. For the final predictive model, 10-fold cross-validation was used, and ROC analysis performed. Sample size adequacy was evaluated post-hoc using combined approach that included assessment of model accuracy and the dataset effect size using Cohen\u2019s d statistic (25)."

The observed wide spectrum of post-acute clinical manifestations has created the need for universalization of the set of outcomes to be\u00a0used in long COVID related research which had been recently fulfilled in an international Delphi consensus study (26). The resulting core outcome list included, among others, fatigue, post-exertion symptoms and altered physical functioning, which are being referred to as most frequently imposing debilitating effect (8, 27).\nCardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) remains the gold standard for the quantitative assessment of physical performance, given its high\nFIGURE\u00a03 Clusterization of study participants by 6MWD% changes.\nFrontiers in Medicine 07 frontiersin.org\nsensitivity and discriminatory ability in differentiation of exercise intolerance causes (28). At the same time, a high flow of newlyrecovered post-COVID-19 patients calls for the use of simpler outcome measures with higher availability. Among the tests that fit this description, sit-to-stand (STS) and 6 min walk test (6MWT) are the most obvious choices due to the ease of use and being low-tech. Out of the two, 6MWT has some additional benefits that include better standardization (21), wider spectrum of obtained parameters, and more robust evidence of its diagnostic and prognostic significance both in the setting of chronic pulmonary conditions (17, 29) and postacute SARS-CoV-2 infection (19). A recent meta-analysis has also confirmed the sensitivity of 6MWT in assessing the efficacy of postCOVID-19 pulmonary rehabilitation (30). In addition, 6MWT requires a sustained submaximal effort for a longer period of time compared to what is used in the STS test (30 to 60 s) and thus could increase the chance to unmask possible subclinical cardiopulmonary functional alterations. This study reports on the results of comprehensive 6MWT in hospitalized COVID-19 patients that was performed 1\u20132 days pre-discharge at a baseline and after 1 month of spontaneous recovery and assessed the distance walked, changes of heart rate and SpO2 throughout the test.\nTABLE\u00a03 Clinical characteristics of patients with poor vs. satisfactory/good dynamics of functional recovery after hospitalization for COVID-19 as assessed by 6MWT.\nParameters Cluster 4 Clusters 1 + 2 + 3 Difference 2-sided p\n(Poor recovery) (Satisfactory recovery)\n(95% CI)\nSubjects 27 72\nFemale sex 10 (37) 34 (47) 0.364\nAge, years 38.2 \u00b1 11.0 54.9 \u00b1 12.1 16.8 (11.4\u201322.1) <0.001\nHeight, cm 173.8 \u00b1 11.2 171.1 \u00b1 9.0 \u22122.7 (\u22127.1 to 1.6) 0.216\nWeight, kg 84.1 \u00b1 16.3 87.7 \u00b1 15.2 3.5 (\u22123.5 to 10.6) 0.324\nBMI, kg/m2 27.8 \u00b1 4.7 29.9 \u00b1 4.2 2.1 (0.1\u20134.0) 0.038\nComorbidities\nHypertension 6 (22) 34 (47) 0.024\nObesity 7 (26) 35 (49) 0.042\nDiabetes mellitus, type 2 2 (7) 12 (17) 0.239\nCharlson comorbidity index 0.2 \u00b1 0.8 0.6 \u00b1 0.9 0.4 (0.0\u20130.8) 0.054\nActive smoking status 7 (26) 17 (24) 0.810\nIntensive care unit admission 2 (7) 4 (6) 0.731\nPulmonary tissue involvement by CT, % 43.7 \u00b1 8.8 29.6 \u00b1 19.4 \u221214.1 (\u221226.7 to \u22121.5) 0.029\nMinimal SpO2 during hospitalization, % 90.1 \u00b1 5.5 87.9 \u00b1 8.7 \u22122.2 (\u22125.8 to 1.4) 0.227\nOxygen supplementation\nVia nasal cannula 11 (41) 46 (64) 0.038\nNoninvasive/invasive ventilation 2 (7) 4 (6) 0.731\nLaboratory parameters\nPeak IL-6, pg/mL 10.4 [6.3\u201317.9] 15.4 [3.1\u201350.0] 0.550\nPeak CRP, mg/L 30 [12\u2013130] 24 [6\u201360] 0.238\nPeak ESR, mm/h 36.5 \u00b1 9.7 25.6 \u00b1 12.8 \u221210.8 (\u221216.9 to \u22124.7) <0.001\nPeak procalcitonin, ng/mL 0.06 [0.05\u20130.08] 0.06 [0.04\u20130.09] 0.649\nPeak D-dimer, ng/mL 223 [153\u2013414] 219 [156\u2013628] 0.623\nPeak creatinine, \u03bcmol/L 99.5 \u00b1 16.7 99.4 \u00b1 17.5 \u22120.1 (\u221211.5 to 11.3) 0.986\nLowest eGFR, ml/min/1.73m2 82.9 \u00b1 21.8 69.1 \u00b1 17.5 \u221213.7 (\u221225.9 to \u22121.6) 0.027\nTreatment\nRemdesivir 9 (33) 33 (46) 0.262\nDexamethasone 25 (93) 58 (81) 0.147\nMethylprednisolone pulse therapy 17 (61) 43 (60) 0.769\nAntibiotics 23 (85) 60 (83) 0.824\nCI, confidence interval; BMI, body mass index; CT, computed tomography; IL-6, interleukin 6; CRP, C-reactive protein; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate by CKD-EPI equation.\nFrontiers in Medicine 08 frontiersin.org\nThe main findings at the baseline evaluation included a significant reduction in 6MWD (396 \u00b1 71 m or 68.7 \u00b1 12.4% compared to individually predicted values) that was associated with a 2.9 \u00b1 2.5% maximal oxygen desaturation throughout the test and a modest 24.9 \u00b1 17.5 bpm increment of heart rate that topped out at 61.1 \u00b1 8.1% of individually predicted maximum. Re-evaluation at 1 month has revealed an improvement in most parameters, but the mean values of 6MWD% (81.8 \u00b1 13.6), HRmax % (64.3 \u00b1 8.2), and HR increment during the test (28.2 \u00b1 12.0 bpm) remained suboptimal, thus objectively confirming the persistently impaired physical performance in study participants.\nA large number of regression equations exists to predict individually expected 6MWD (17), and the selection of model naturally affects the interpretation of test data. Pursuing the reproducibility and comparability of obtained results, we\u00a0have chosen to use classic equations by Enright et\u00a0al. (23) that were derived from the cohort of patients aged 40 to 80 years using a 30 m hallway. Thus, systematic overestimation of predicted 6MWD in younger patients\nand shorter track effects had to be\u00a0excluded as a possible source of bias in our study. To solve this problem, were-calculated the analyzed parameters using equations obtained at a 20 m walkway in 20\u201380 years old population (31) and those using log-linear regression to account for possible non-linear effects (32). None of alternatives used led to essential changes in the observed results, which, together with almost perfect linearity of the age\u2014factual 6MWD scatterplots in the cohort used by Enright et\u00a0al. (23) allows us to consider this factor irrelevant.\nA meta-analysis by Ahmed et\u00a0al.

The results of our observational study suggest that the real-life scenario of a post-discharge return to the usual routine imposes a significant training effect that might be\u00a0comparable to that of rehabilitation program in a large proportion of COVID-19 convalescents, reaching as high as 78 \u00b1 44 m in the cohort of patients with satisfactory post-discharge recovery. As a tool to identify the patients with poor 1\u00a0month dynamics of spontaneous physical recovery as assessed by the 6MWT (and who, therefore, would hypothetically benefit the most from rehabilitation intervention), we\u00a0applied the automatic clusterization of patients by the baseline values and between-visits increment of 6MWD%. This approach allowed to exclude the patients who did not have impressive improvement as a result of high base effect (cluster 3), and also those in whom suboptimal visit 2 parameters were resulting from significant\nFIGURE\u00a04 Artificial neural network to predict poor functional recovery after hospitalization for COVID-19.

The same parameters along with eGFR, need for oxygen supplementation, SpO2 and mMRC dyspnea score pre-discharge were predictors of attribution to the poor recovery cluster in the multivariate regression analysis that allowed to build two high quality logistic models based on early in-hospital (Model A, AUROC = 0.95) and pre-discharge parameters (Model B, AUROC = 0.98). One has to mention that the available cohort size was less compared to recommended minimum for logistic regression (33), hence no further downsizing it due to sampling in order to allow for subsequent internal validation was used.\nWith a purpose of further optimization of patients\u2019 classification, unsupervised ML-based predictive model utilizing 6-7-2 SANN architecture was created that used age, history of hypertension, need for oxygen supplementation, and ESR as inputs, and had 100% performance in the random 30% test/validation subset of the study cohort and 94% predictive performance in cross-validation. Sample size assessment in ML projects is a problem with no consensus reached to date (34); in our study, the ratio of training cases to predictors number was 17.5:1, which was in line with the usual requirements used for ML projects (35). In addition, we\u00a0applied a post-hoc assessment approach that has the benefit of being better fit to specific task, thus preventing the overestimation of minimally required sample size (25, 34). The combination of large input dataset effect size (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.739), high accuracy of the acquired model and its reproducibility in cross-validation attested to its validity and absence of significant overfitting and random effects (25).\nThe long-lasting decrease of physical performance is one of the typical features of post-COVID syndrome, as has been shown in a number of studies in the form of decreased oxygen uptake during CPET (28). Being an integrative parameter, the latter might have heterogenous underlying mechanisms in different phenotypes of long COVID.\nThere is evidence supporting the role of decreased diffusing lung capacity (DLCO) and, to a lesser extent, restrictive pulmonary physiology (36, 37) in this phenomenon. The study by Orzes et\u00a0al. (38) reveals a long-term preservation of functional pulmonary abnormalities that were present in 53% of patients at 3 months and in 38% at 6 months after discharge, with the combination of decreased DLCO and restrictive changes being the dominant pattern. The reported rates of respiratory abnormalities were also in line with the previous studies that revealed 53 to 71% prevalence of subnormal DLCO and 12% to 21% of restrictive changes at the term of 4 to 6 weeks (39, 40). These findings are supported by the meta-analysis by Guo et\u00a0al. (36) that underlines the poor dynamics of spontaneous reversal of residual pulmonary function alterations starting from the term of 1 month post-discharge and extending beyond 6 months, thus supporting the concept of early identification of patients at risk with a subsequent focus on their targeted rehabilitation.\nAn additive burden on oxygen delivery system may also be\u00a0 imposed by co-existing mild impairment in cardiac function manifested as lower stroke volume, global longitudinal strain and high incidence of diastolic dysfunction (41, 42). At the same time, the grade\nof detected alterations in the mentioned central Wasserman gears (43) does not completely account for the decrease of oxygen uptake that is being detected in post-acute COVID-19 patients.\nDysautonomia and chronotropic incompetence have also been shown to contribute to the observed decrease in oxygen uptake (44, 45). This concept is being corroborated by the results of our study, where patients with poor post-discharge functional recovery, despite their younger age, exhibited higher baseline heart rate and the tendency to lower percentage of individual maximum heart rate that was reached during the test. Finally, peripheral mitochondrial function might also be\u00a0 altered in post-COVID syndrome further contributing to decreased oxygen utilization (28).\nGiven the heterogeneity of possible mechanisms of reduction of functional capacity, pathophysiological phenotyping of long COVID population might prove to be\u00a0beneficial in the context of targeted treatment strategies. At the same time, their proper development and implementation is a lengthy process with unclear timeline. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation remains the only intervention that has been shown to date to improve physical performance in patients with long COVID syndrome (14, 15), and there is no reason to believe that newly developed treatments might cause a decrease in its use. With a continuously growing postCOVID population, rehabilitation system capacity gets at times overwhelmed, calling for optimization of candidate selection for the supervised training programs which would allow for more effective use of available resources.\nA lot of studies have been devoted to exploring the spectrum of long COVID symptoms and identifying patients at risk of its development (37). At the same time, majority of them were using selfreported outcome measures of physical performance that are susceptible to excessive variability related to differences in individual perception. Among the predictors of objectively measured physical recovery outcomes in the post-acute COVID-19 setting, we\u00a0 have identified mentioning of PaO2/FiO2 during hospitalization and extensity of radiological abnormalities (9), frailty and length of hospital stay (46), persistence of fatigue and dyspnea (47), which was in line with the map of predictors detected in our cohort.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study proposing a set of predictive tools for the assessment of expected physical recovery dynamics by the 6MWT in the early post-discharge period after COVID-19 basing on sets of inputs optimized for their easy and early availability during in-hospital period (similar approach has been described recently for the prediction of radiological recovery (48)). The proposed ML-based classification model may be\u00a0used as a selfsufficient tool after external validation on the local cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, or as a concept for development of similar models that would account for features of local population and currently prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variants."

At the same time, the prevalence of main comorbidities in the study cohort was in line with previously published reports, and thus the general picture was unlikely to be\u00a0altered due to the latter factor. Finally, the spectrum of currently prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variants has changed compared to the time of enrollment to our study, and a higher proportion of patients has since received vaccination.
