            "text": "In this paper we study the partition function of N = 2 super Yang Mills theories with general simple gauge group G in presence of a surface defect. The latter is described by a two-dimensional N = (2, 2) gauged linear \u03c3-model living on the defect and coupled to the bulk four-dimensional theory. This implies that the defect partition function obeys tt\u2217 equations [1], which for the theories under consideration correspond to a de-autonomized Toda system. The defect partition function is vector-valued according to the set of admissible boundary conditions, labeled by the roots of the affine Langlands dual Lie algebra (g\u0302)\u2228[2]. The de-autonomization corresponds to studying the gauge theory in the so-called self-dual \u2126-background ( ,\u2212 ). The limit \u2192 0 reproduces the classical Seiberg-Witten theory [3] which is known to be described by the autonomous Toda chain of type (G\u0302)\u2228 [4, 5]. The system of equations we study is the radial reduction of tt\u2217-equations which describes complex deformations of a Z(G)-singularity, Z(G) being the center of the gauge group. These are the equations of non-autonomous twisted affine Toda chain of type (G\u0302)\u2228, where (G\u0302)\u2228 is the Langlands dual of the untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra G\u0302. In order to clarify the appeareance of the Langlands dual group, we start from the analysis of the surface operators in theN = 2\u2217 theory in terms of the de-autonomized Calogero system, whose limit to super YangMills naturally produces the relevant root system. Each node of the resulting affine Dynkin diagram defines a surface operator, the associated \u03c4 -function being its vacuum expectation value. A special r\u00f4le is played by the surface operators associated to the affine nodes. These are simple surface operators whose monodromy is twisted by elements of the center of the gauge group Z(G). As such, they are bounded by fractional \u2019t Hooft lines and generate the corresponding one-form symmetry of the gauge theory. This is manifest as a Z(G)symmetry of the \u03c4 -system and will be used to simplify its solution. Our analysis will be based on the observation that the surface operators associated to affine nodes are described in a perturbative regime of the bulk gauge theory and as such the partition function of the theory in their presence admits the ansatz (3.6). Indeed, the time flow of the non-autonomous system corresponds in the gauge theory to the renormalization group flow, the time playing the r\u00f4le of the gauge coupling constant. The system of equations produces recurrence relations for the coefficients of expansion in the gauge coupling (3.6) thus providing a new effective algorithm to calculate instanton contributions for all classical groups G. Actually, general recursion formulae based on bilinear relations can\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nbe provided for the A,B and D groups, while for gauge group of type C, E, F and G a case by case analysis is needed. On the mathematical side, the \u03c4 -functions we obtain provide the general solution at the canonical rays for the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno isomonodromic deformation problem [6, 7] on the sphere with two-irregular punctures for all classical groups, which to the best of our knowledge was not known in the previous literature. The recursion relations we obtain are indeed different from the blow-up equations of [8] and further elaborated in [9]. The latter necessarily involve the knowledge of the partition function in different \u2126-backgrounds, which makes the recursion relations and the results from blow-up equations more involved and difficult to handle. Nonetheless, we expect a relation between the two approaches to follow from surface defects blow-up relations. The isomonodromic \u03c4 - function for the sphere with four regular punctures was obtained in a similar way from SU(2) gauge theory with Nf = 4 in [10]. An analogous analysis for general classical groups is still missing in the literature. Some of the results we discuss were anticipated in the letter [11]. Here we elaborate on them, by giving more detailed proofs and checks and by extending to other cases. In particular we study the cases of twisted affine Lie algebrae and linear quiver theories. We find that the \u03c4 function for the twisted affine Lie algebra BC1 interestingly satisfies the radial reduction of Bullough-Dodd equations, and it is related to the v.e.v. of surface defect in N = 2 SU(2) gauge theory with one massless hypermultiplet in the fundamental representation. We also study the BC2 for which we do not have at present a gauge theory interpretation. We conjecture bilinear relations satisfied by the \u03c4 -functions of SU(2) linear quiver theories which can be obtained from M-theory compactification on a Riemann sphere with two irregular punctures and n \u2212 2 regular ones [12]. From the mathematical viewpoint these \u03c4 functions describe isomonodromic deformations of SL(2,C) flat connections on the very same Riemann sphere, and can be obtained from a suitable confluence limit of the Garnier system on the Riemann sphere with n+ 2 regular singularities. While the bilinear equations we write govern just the isomonodromic flow in the moduli of the two irregular punctures, we observe that a general solution can be found by imposing consistency of the system in suitable asymptotic limits. It would be interesting to complete the \u03c4 -system with the equations governing the dependence on the moduli of the regular punctures and study the relation of the results we find with bilinear systems for the \u03c4 -functions of the Garnier system [13].\nLet us comment on other interesting directions to investigate further. From the bulk four dimensional gauge theory perspective the \u03c4 -system we find and its\npossible generalizations are expected to describe chiral ring relations in presence of a surface operator. Schematically, we expect eq.(3.5) to derive from the following fusion rule among the chiral operator O = tr\u03c62 and the surface operator W\u03b2\n<: O2 : W\u03b2 >= \u2212 \u03b2\u2228 \u00b7 \u03b2\u2228\n2 t1/h \u2228 \u220f \u03b1\u2208\u2206\u0302,\u03b1 6=\u03b2 < W\u03b1 > \u2212\u03b1\u00b7\u03b2\u2228 ,\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nwhile higher chiral observables should generate the flows of the full non-autonomous Toda hierarchy. The \u03c4 -functions we compute in this paper could be used to describe through their zeroes the spectrum of the quantum Toda chain integrable system along the lines of [14, 15]. It should be possible to apply the approach proposed here to general class-S theories [12] by studying the related isomonodromic deformation problem, for example for circular quivers, generalising to other classical groups the results of [16, 17]. It would be also interesting to extend the analysis to non-self-dual \u2126-background, which should amount to the quantization of the \u03c4 -systems, and its lift to five dimensional gauge theories on R4 \u00d7 S1, which should correspond to quantum q-difference \u03c4 -systems [18\u201323]. The expansion in the large couplings regime should also be considered by extending the analysis of [24, 25]. Actually, the RG evolution at strong coupling can be analysed through late time expansion of the \u03c4 -functions. In particular, in [26] the solution in this regime for the An series has been given in terms of a matrix model describing the theory around the massless monopoles point which generalizes the O(2) matrix model of [27]. As a related problem, it would be also interesting to priovide a Fredholm determinant/Pfaffian representation for the \u03c4 -functions presented here, see for example [28] for the case of orthogonal groups. It would also be interesting to study the extension to defects in supergroup gauge theories, see for example [29]. Outline of the paper: The content of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we describe the non autonomous Calogero Moser system corresponding to N = 2\u2217 gauge thoery with general simple gauge group G as an isomonodromic deformation problem on the elliptic curve and its limit to the non autonomous Toda system which instead describes the isomonodromic deformation problem on the Riemann sphere with two irregular singularities. We show how the limiting procedure directly gives the twisted affine Toda chain of type (G\u0302)\u2228. In Section 3 we derive the \u03c4 -form of the above non autonomous Toda system and fix the asymptotic conditions which are relevant to describe the gauge theory surface operators. In Section 4 we analyse the explicit solution of the \u03c4 -system for all the classical groups at the diverse levels of accuracy we could reach. In Section 5 we extend our analysis to affine twisted Lie algebras and in Section 6 we comment on conjectural bilinear relations for the \u03c4 -functions of linear quiver gauge theory. In the appendices we collect some technical results needed in the main text. In particular in Appendix B.5 we discuss the blow-up formula in four dimensions for general groups (B.9) and in appendix C we describe the universal asymptotic behaviour of the instanton partition functions for large Coulomb moduli.\nAcknowledgements: We would like to thank P.

            "text": "In this section we derive the relevant equations on the \u03c4 -functions for the Toda system related to any simple classical group. These are derived starting from the elliptic case in which Langland duality is manifest.\nOn the one-pointed torus, C1,1 \u223c= T\u03c4 \u223c= C/Z\u2295\u03c4Z, where \u03c4 \u2208M \u223c= (H+)PSL(2,Z)\u222a{ \u221a \u22121\u221e}\ndenotes a complex structure and corresponds to the isomonodromic time \u03c4 The isomonodromic system is given by a Fuchsian system together with an isomonodromic flow\n\u2202z\u03a6(z) = L(z)\u03a6(z), (2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121)\u2202\u03c4\u03a6(z) = \u2212M(z)\u03a6(z)\nwhere z \u2208 C1,1 [30]. The related autonomous integrable system is the elliptic Calogero-Moser system [31] which in gauge theory corresponds to N = 2\u2217. The reason for starting with an extra adjoint hypermultiplet as opposed to the pure theory is that the limit to pure theory gives the context as to why the Langland dual extended root system plays a r\u00f4le, since these are the only roots whose contributions survives in the decoupling limit to the de-autonomized Toda system. The deautonomized elliptic Calogero-Moser system can be formulated for any complex simple Lie algebra g of finite rank k, whose root system we realize in a finite dimensional C-vector space V equipped with an explicit basis {ei}i=1,...,dimV , so the root system is R \u2286 V . We identify V \u2228 \u223c= V using the canonical product. Let \u03d5 :M\u2192 V be a vector valued function satisfying the deautonomized elliptic Calogero-Moser system\n(2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121)\u22022\u03c4\u03d5 = \u2212 M2\n2 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208R \u2118\u2032(\u03b1 \u00b7\u03d5|\u03c4)\u03b1\nwhere \u2118\u2032(z|\u03c4) denotes the z-derivative of the Weierstrass elliptic function, and M is the mass of the adjoint hypermultiplet. There is a well-defined autonomization procedure which maps the isomonodromic to the integrable system [32]. These deautonomized systems are quite non-trivial. Indeed, in [33] the so-called elliptic sixth Painlev\u00e9 transcendent was defined as the solution to the equation \u22022\u03c4 z = \u2212\u2118\u2032(z|\u03c4)/(8\u03c0)2, and this is the simplest such system, corresponding to the Lie algebra g = A1. Let us briefly recall how the autonomization procedure works. Essentially, here we need to pass from the full problem formulated on the moduli space M of the one-punctured torus with complex structure \u03c4 , T\u03c4 , to its tangent space at some fixed complex structure \u03c40, TM|T\u03c40\n\u223c= H0(T\u03c40 ,\u21261) \u223c= C. As described in [34], we take \u03c4 = \u03c40 + t, \u2202\u03c4 7\u2192 \u2202\u03c40 , and take the \u2192 0 limit, perhaps ridding ourselves of some convenient 2\u03c0i factors as well. In the context of gauge theory, this limit corresponds to turning off the Omega-background.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nLet \u03c1\u2228 and h\u2228 denote the dual Weyl vector and dual Coxeter number, respectively. The decoupling of the hypermultiplet which brings to pure N = 2 Super Yang-Mills or nonconformal AGT [35] is the Inosemtsev limit, achieved by setting\n\u03c4 = 1\n2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121 log\n( \u039b\nM )2h\u2228 \u03d5 7\u2192 \u03d5+ 1\n2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121\n1\nh\u2228 log\n( \u039b\nM\n)2h\u2228 \u00b7 \u03c1\u2228\nand then sending M \u2192\u221e. \u039b \u2208 C plays the role of the time. To perform the limit, we quote the q-series of the relevant elliptic function [36], which can be proved using the Lipschitz summation formula [37, \u00a7 2.2],\n(2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121)\u22123\u2118\u2032(z|\u03c4) = \u2211 n\u22650 qnwz 1 + qnwz (1\u2212 qnwz)3 \u2212 \u2211 n\u22651 qnw\u2212z 1 + qnw\u2212z (1\u2212 qnw\u2212z)3\nwhere q = e2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121\u03c4 is the so-called nome and wz = e2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121z. To perform the limit, first note that we may restrict ourselves to positive roots, as \u2118\u2032(\u2212\u03b1,Q|\u03c4)(\u2212\u03b1) = \u2118\u2032(\u03b1,Q|\u03c4)\u03b1. Second, examine the powers of (\u039b/M)2, and use the properties of positive simple coroots and the longest coroot given by the level function, as follows. Following [38], define the level function ` : R \u2192 R by \u03b1 7\u2192 `(\u03b1) := \u3008\u03c1\u2228,\u03b1\u3009, where \u03c1\u2228 := 12 \u2211r j=1\u03b1 \u2228 j \u2208 g\u2228 is the dual Weyl vector. Then, `(\u03b1\u2228) = 1 if and only if \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206+, and `(\u03b1\u2228) = h\u2228 \u2212 1 if and only if \u03b1 = \u03b8\u2228, where h\u2228 is the dual Coxeter number. Examining the terms remaining after the limit, we see we have contributions either from positive simple coroots, or from \u03b8\u2228. The elliptic system reduces to a trigonometric one, and only the roots corresponding to the dual extended root system survive, namely the ones whose affine Cartan matrix got transposed. The significance of the dual affine system to SW theory is well-known [5, 39]. The resulting system is\n\u22022log t\u03d5 = \u2212t1/h \u2228 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208\u2206\u0302+ \u03b1\u2228e\u03b1 \u2228\u00b7\u03d5 (2.1)\nwhere t := \u039b2h\u2228 , \u2206\u0302+ = {\u03b8}\u222a\u2206+ are the extended positive roots, and we redefined (2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121)\u03d5 7\u2192 \u03d5 for simplicity. Once the asymptotic form of the solution is specified, the solution can be found by series expansion with a non zero (possibly infinite) convergence radius. The natural choice is to start with the homogenous solution and let \u03d5 = a + log t \u00b7 b + \u03be for constant a and b. The prefactor t1/h\u2228 can be eliminated by setting b = \u03c3\u2212 1h\u2228\u03c1\n\u2228. After this, a solution in terms of a power series in t and {t\u03c3i}ki=1 can be found recursively from\n\u22022log t\u03be = \u03b8 \u2228e\u2212\u03b8 \u2228\u00b7at1\u2212\u03b8 \u2228\u00b7\u03c3e\u2212\u03b8\u00b7\u03be \u2212 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208\u2206+ \u03b1\u2228e\u03b1 \u2228\u00b7at\u03b1 \u2228\u00b7\u03c3e\u03b1 \u2228\u00b7\u03be (2.2)\nfrom which we see that to ensure convergence, \u03c3 \u2208 W\u2228fund., the fundamental Weyl alcove of the dual root system, as\n1\u2212 \u03b8\u2228 \u00b7 \u03c3 > 0 \u03b1\u2228i \u00b7 \u03c3 > 0, i = 1, ..., r\n} \u21d2 \u03c3 \u2208 W\u2228fund.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nTherefore, solutions are in bijection with points of W\u2228fund.. The choice of the affine root is not unique if outer automorphisms of the affine Dynkin diagram exist. For the simplest case A1, there is one root which we realize as \u03b1 = (1,\u22121) and the automorphism is the reflection around the origin. Then we have \u03c1 = 1/2 \u00b7\u03b1 = (1/2,\u22121/2) and h\u2228 = 2, so\nb = ( b1 b2 ) = \u03c3 \u2212 1 h\u2228 \u03c1\u2228 = ( \u03c31 \u2212 1/4 \u03c32 + 1/4 ) 7\u2192 ( b2 b1 ) = ( \u03c32 + 1/4 \u03c31 \u2212 1/4 )\nThe effect of the reflection is \u03c31 7\u2192 \u03c32+1/2, \u03c32 7\u2192 \u03c31\u22121/2. We should really be specializing to the sl2 slice \u03c31 +\u03c32 = 0, which we often neglect to make expressions simpler; setting \u03c3 = \u03c31 = \u2212\u03c32, however, we see that this is really the B\u00e4cklund transformation \u03c4(\u03c3|t) 7\u2192 \u03c4(1/2 \u2212 \u03c3|t) of Painlev\u00e9 III3, analyzed in detail in [40]. In An, cyclic transformations may be seen to shift \u03c3 by fundamental weights. We use this redundant to solve the system, since as we will see it reduces the order of the equations drastically."

We claim that the \u03c4 functions generate the Hamiltonian, in the sense that they satisfy\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206\u0302+\n\u2202log t log \u03c4\u03b1 = h \u2228tH\nup to a constant, where\ntH(\u03d5,\u03c0, t) = 1 2 \u03c02 + t 1 h\u2228 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208\u2206\u0302+ e\u03b1 \u2228\u00b7\u03d5\nis the Hamiltonian of the deautonomised system.Indeed, we check that\n(t\u2202t) (tH) = (t\u2202t) \u03c02 2 + t 1 h\u2228 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208\u2206\u0302+ e\u03b1 \u2228\u00b7\u03d5  = \u03c0 \u00b7 \u2202log t\u03c0 +\nt 1h\u2228 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208\u2206\u0302+ \u03b1\u2228e\u03b1 \u2228\u00b7\u03d5  \u00b7 \u2202log t\u03d5+ 1 h\u2228 t 1 h\u2228 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208\u2206\u0302+ e\u03b1 \u2228\u00b7\u03d5\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nand since the first two terms vanish on-shell, so the claim follows. Equipped with these \u03c4 functions, we note that (2.1) can be rewritten as\n\u22022log t \u03d5+\u2211 j \u03b1\u2228j log \u03c4\u03b1j  = 0 We can integrate this and then reconstruct the solution \u03d5 in terms of \u03c4 functions from the components in the expansion \u03d5 = \u2211 i \u03d5iei, namely\n\u03d5i = c1,i + c2,i log t\u2212 log \u220f \u03b1\u2208\u2206\u0302+ [\u03c4\u03b1(\u03d5)] \u03b1\u00b7ei (3.2)\nwhere the integration constants c1,2 follow from the ambiguity in the definition of the \u03c4 functions. Feeding back into (3.1), the isomonodromic system may be reformulated purely in terms of the \u03c4 functions as\n\u22022log t log \u03c4\u03b1 = \u2212t 1 h\u2228 \u220f \u03b2\u2208\u2206\u0302+ [\u03c4\u03b1] \u2212\u03b2\u2228\u00b7\u03b1\u2228 (3.3)\nwere the minus sign in the R.H.S. of (3.3) is obtained by a rescaling the time variable as t \u2192 e \u221a \u22121\u03c0h\u2228t. We will find it useful to rewrite this expression in terms of a logarithmic Hirota derivative defined as\nD2(f) = f2\u22022log t log f = f\u2202 2 log tf \u2212 (\u2202log tf)2\nand satisfying\nD2(fn) = 2nf2(n\u22121)D2(fn)\nD2(f \u00b7 g) = f2D2(g) + g2D2(f) .\nWe can then rewrite the system as\n\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u2228\u00b7\u03b1\u2228\u22122D2(\u03c4\u03b1) = \u2212t 1 h\u2228 \u220f \u03b2 6=\u03b1 [\u03c4\u03b2] \u2212\u03b2\u2228\u00b7\u03b1\u2228 (3.4)\nwhere the factor of \u03c4\u03b2\u03b2 \u2228\u00b7\u03b2\u2228 has been extracted from the product and carried to the other side and the definition of the Hirota derivative was used. Moreover, using the first Hirota derivative identity, we get\n\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u2228\u00b7\u03b1\u2228\u22122D2(\u03c4\u03b1) =\n2\n\u03b1\u2228 \u00b7\u03b1\u2228 D2([\u03c4\u03b1]\n\u03b1\u2228\u00b7\u03b1\u2228 2 ) = \u2212t 1 h\u2228 \u220f \u03b2 6=\u03b1 [\u03c4\u03b2] \u03b2\u2228\u00b7\u03b2\u2228 2 (\u2212\u03b1\u2228\u00b7 2\u03b2 \u2228 \u03b2\u2228\u00b7\u03b2\u2228 )\nand redefining [\u03c4\u03b1] \u03b1\u2228\u00b7\u03b1\u2228 2 7\u2192 \u03c4\u03b1 for every root \u03b1 we finally get the equation\nD2(\u03c4\u03b1) = \u2212 \u03b1\u2228 \u00b7\u03b1\u2228\n2 t1/h \u2228 \u220f \u03b2\u2208\u2206\u0302,\u03b2 6=\u03b1 [\u03c4\u03b2] \u2212\u03b1\u2228\u00b7\u03b2 , (3.5)\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nThe above redefinition leaves unchanged the \u03c4 -functions corresponding to miniscule coweights. By the ambiguity in the constants of integration, both (3.3) and (3.4) may be modified by a constant or a power of t. Further, we will be writing D4 := D2 \u25e6 D2, D2n := D2 \u25e6 D2n\u22122. Finally, the \u03c4 function associated to the constant solution \u03d50 = a is immediate from (3.1),\n\u03c4\u03b1(\u03d50, t) = exp { (h\u2228)2t 1 h\u2228 e\u03b1\u00b7a } Eq. (3.5) is the de-autonomization of the \u03c4 -form of the standard Toda integrable system.\nFrom [4, 5] it is known that this governs the classical Seiberg-Witten (SW) theory [41]. The deautonomization is induced by coupling the theory to a self-dual \u2126-background ( 1, 2) = ( ,\u2212 ) [25]. In the autonomous limit \u2192 0, the relevant \u03c4 -functions boil down to Riemann \u03b8functions on the classical SW curve [16]. These were used to provide recursion relations on the coefficients of the expansion of the SW prepotential in [42]. The actual form of equations (3.5) depends on the Dynkin diagram. In particular, these reduce to bilinear equations for the classical groups A, B and D, which we solve via general recursion relations. Instead, for C, E, F and G groups the equations of the \u03c4 -system are of higher order and must be studied by a case by case analysis. The \u03c4 -system displays a finite symmetry generated by the center of the group G, namely\ng An Bn Cn D2n D2n+1 En F4 G2\nZ(G) Zn+1 Z2 Z2 Z2 \u00d7 Z2 Z4 Z9\u2212n 1 1\nThe center is isomorphic to the coset of the affine coweight lattice by the affine coroot lattice, and coincides with the automorphism group of the affine Dynkin diagram. As in 1, the coweights, and by extension the lattice cosets, corresponding to these nodes are the minuscule coweights. We recall that a representation of g is minuscule if all its weights form a single Weyl-orbit. This remark will be crucial to solve the \u03c4 -system. The \u03c4 -functions corresponding to the affine nodes, namely the ones which can be removed from the Dynkin diagram while leaving behind that of an irreducible simple Lie algebra, play a special r\u00f4le. In the gauge theory interpretation of the Introduction, these are related to simple surface operators associated to elements of the center Z(G), and are bounded by fractional \u2019t Hooft lines. As such, they are the generators of the one-form symmetry of the corresponding gauge theory, [43]. Since their magnetic charge is defined modulo the magnetic root lattice, a natural Ansatz for their expectation value is\n\u03c4\u03b1aff (\u03c3,\u03b7|\u03bagt) = \u2211\nn\u2208Q\u2228aff\ne2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121\u03b7\u00b7nt 1 2 (\u03c3+n)2B(\u03c3 + n|t) (3.6)\nwhere B(\u03c3|t) = B0(\u03c3) \u2211 i\u22650 t iZi(\u03c3) with Z0(\u03c3) \u2261 1 and Q\u2228aff = \u03bb \u2228 aff + Q\n\u2228, Q\u2228 being the coroot lattice equipped with the canonical inner product normalized such that the norm of the short coroots is 2, and (\u03bb\u2228aff,\u03b1) = \u03b4\u03b1aff,\u03b1 for any non-extended simple root \u03b1. The\n1Bourbaki [Lie gps Ch. VIII \u00a77]\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nconstant \u03bag = (\u2212ng)rg,s , where ng is the ratio of the squares of long vs. short roots and rg,s is the number of short simple roots. For simply laced, all roots are long and \u03bag = 1. In the An case, (3.6) is known as the Kiev Ansatz. In particular, in the A1 case, it was used to give the general solution of Painlev\u00e9 III3 equation in [24] and further analysed in [44]. It was crucial for these results to identify the expansion coefficients of (3.6) with the full Nekrasov partition function in the self-dual \u2126-background. We will now show that this still holds for general classical groups. More precisely, this follows upon the identification \u03c3 = a/ , where a is the Cartan parameter of the gauge theory. Let us remark that the variables \u03b7,\u03c3 \u2208 Q\u2228 are the integration constants of the second order differential equations (3.5) and correspond to the initial position and velocity of the de-autonomized Toda particle. Let us set now the boundary conditions which we impose to the solutions of equations (3.5). We consider the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions at t\u2192 0 and \u03c3 \u2192\u221e as\nlog(B0) \u223c \u2212 1\n4 \u2211 r\u2208R (r \u00b7 \u03c3)2 log (r \u00b7 \u03c3)2 (3.7)\nup to quadratic and log-terms. Notice that the \u03c4 -system knows itself the one-loop exactness of the N = 2 gauge theory! Indeed, if one chooses a more general ansatz for the Wilsonian effective action as log(B0) \u223c\u2211 r\u2208R cn,m(r \u00b7 \u03c3)2n log ( (r \u00b7 \u03c3)2\n)m, then the consistency of the equation itself implies that (n,m) = (1, 1) and (n,m) = (2, 0) are the only allowed terms.\nWe will show that the solution of (3.5) which satisfies the above asymptotic condition is\nB0(\u03c3) = Z1\u2212loop(\u03c3) \u2261 \u220f r\u2208R\n1\nG(1 + r \u00b7 \u03c3) (3.8)\nwhere G(z) is the Barnes\u2019 G-function and R is the adjoint representation of the group G. The expansion of the above function matches the one-loop gauge theory result upon the appropriate identification of the log-branch. This reads, in the gauge theory variables, as ln [\u221a \u22121r \u00b7 a/\u039b ] \u2208 R and in the An case matches the canonical Stokes rays obtained in [45]. Eq.(3.8) corresponds to the 1-loop term in the self-dual \u2126-background. To see this more clearly, recall the perturbative Coleman-Weinberg 1-loop term for a massless hypermultiplet in 4 dimensions with IR regulator \u00b5,\nF1 loop(\u03c3) = 3 4 tr\u03c32 \u2212 1 4 tr\u03c32 log\n( \u03c3\n\u00b5\n)2 = \u222b \u221e \u00b5 ds s3 tr e\u2212s\u03c3 +O( 1 \u00b52 ) (3.9)\nwhere the trace is taken in the relevant representation. In the self-dual \u2126-background with parameter , this gets deformed to\u222b \u221e\n\u00b5\nds\ns\n\u2212 2 \u00b7 tr e\u2212s\u03c3\n(1\u2212 es )(1\u2212 e\u2212s )\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nwhich we can write in terms of the Barnes\u2019 G function by using its L\u00e9vy-Khintchine type representation valid for |z| < 1\n1\nG(1 + z) = exp\n{ \u2212 log 2\u03c0 \u2212 1\n2 z +\n1 + \u03b3\n2 z2 \u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 ds s e\u2212zs \u2212 1 + zs\u2212 12s 2z2 (1\u2212 es)(1\u2212 e\u2212s) } where the substractions in the integrand serve as an infrared regulator. For a general gauge group in the Coulomb phase, tracing over the Cartan yields\neF1-loop = exp {\u222b \u221e \u00b5 ds s \u2212 2 \u00b7 trR e\u2212s\u03c3 (1\u2212 es )(1\u2212 e\u2212s ) } \u220f \u03b1\u2208R\n1\nG(1 + \u03c3 \u00b7\u03b1) =: B0(\u03c3)\nThe most important property of this expression is that, given some \u03b2 \u2208 R\u2228,\nB0(\u03c3 + \u03b2) = B0(\u03c3) \u220f\n\u03b1\u2208R,n\u22651 \u03b1\u00b7\u03b2=n\n(\u22121)bn/2c\u0393(\u2212\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c3)n\n\u0393(\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c3)n(\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c3)n n\u22121\u220f k=1 (\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c3 + k)2n\u22122k (3.10)\nwhere we can pick only positive n\u2019s since the product runs over the whole root system.\n4 Lie algebras\n4.1 An\n\u03c40\n\u03c41 \u03c4j\u22121 \u03c4j \u03c4j+1 \u03c4n\nThe An case is the simplest but already illustrates most of the ideas of our analysis. The simplification in this case comes from the fact that every node of the extended Dynkin diagram corresponds to a miniscule (co)weight and that the resulting equations are strictly bilinear, none of which are true in general for different algebras. We realise the roots using an orthonormal basis {ei} of Rn+1 as {\u00b1(ei \u2212 ej)} for i 6= j. The algebra is simply laced so the coroot lattice is the root lattice and is Q\u2228 = Q =\n{ n+1\u2211 i=1 ciei| n+1\u2211 i=1 ci = 0}, while the fundamental weights\n\u03bbi = (1 i, 0n+1\u2212i)\u2212 i\nn+ 1 (1n+1) ,\nare all minuscule. Here (1p, 0n+1\u2212p) stands for a vector whose first p entries are 1 and the remaining entries vanish, while in (1n+1) all entries are 1. Moreover we label the \u03c4 -functions as \u03c4\u03b1j \u2261 \u03c4j and identify \u03c4j = \u03c4n+1+j periodically. Then the \u03c4 -system can be written succinctly as\nD2(\u03c4j) = \u2212t 1 n+1 \u03c4j\u22121\u03c4j+1 . (4.1)\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nDue to the Zn+1 outer automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram, each of the nodes of An can be taken as the affine one so that the corresponding \u03c4 -functions can be expressed through the Kiev Ansatz (3.6). Therefore, all the \u03c4 -functions are determined by a single one, say \u03c40, as \u03c4j = \u03c40|Q 7\u2192Qj . Owing to the Zn+1 symmetry, it is enough to solve (4.1) corresponding to j = 0. Henceforth we adopt the shorthand f(y\u00b1 x) \u2261 f(y+ x)f(y\u2212 x). The Ansatz (3.6) for \u03c40 reads\n\u03c40(\u03c3,\u03b7|t) = \u2211\nn\u2208Q, i\u22650 e2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121n\u00b7\u03b7t 1 2 (\u03c3+n)2+iB0(\u03c3 + n)Zi(\u03c3 + n) (4.2)\nInserting the Kiev Ansatz (4.2) into (4.1) gives us\n\u2211 n1,n2\u2208Q i1,i2\u22650 e2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121(n1+n2)\u00b7\u03b7t 1 2 n21+ 1 2 n22+i1+i2+\u03c3\u00b7(n1+n2) ( 1 2 n21 \u2212 1 2 n22 + i1 \u2212 i2 + \u03c3 \u00b7 (n1 \u2212 n2) )2 \u00d7B0(\u03c3 + n1)B0(\u03c3 + n2)Zi1(\u03c3 + n1)Zi2(\u03c3 + n2)\n= \u2212 \u2211\nm1,m2\u2208Q j1,j2\u22650\ne2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121(m1+m2)\u00b7\u03b7t1+ 1 2 m21+ 1 2 m22+e1\u00b7(m1\u2212m2)+j1+j2+\u03c3\u00b7(m1+m2)\u00d7\nB0(\u03c3 + m1 + e1)B0(\u03c3 + m2 \u2212 e1)Zj1(\u03c3 + m1 + e1)Zj2(\u03c3 + m2 \u2212 e1)\nThis is solved as a power series in t, t\u03c31 , ..., t\u03c3n . To fix B0(\u03c3), we look at the lowest order. The lowest order is linear in t and produces the quadratic constraint\n1 2 n21 + 1 2 n22 + i1 + i2 = 1 + 1 2 m21 + 1 2 m22 + e1 \u00b7 (m1 \u2212m2) + j1 + j2 = 1 (4.3)\nas well as n + 1 linear constraints on the root lattice variables (n1,n2) and (m1,m2). Let us fix p, q \u2208 {0, ...n + 1}, p 6= q and look for terms with t\u03c3p\u2212\u03c3q . The linear constrains are n1+n2 = m1+m2 = ep\u2212eq. Up to Weyl reflections, the only solution to the above mentioned constraints is given by n1 = ep \u2212 eq, n2 = 0 and m1 = ep \u2212 e1, m2 = \u2212eq + e1, with is and js in (4.3) vanishing, leading to the functional equation\n(1 + (ep \u2212 eq) \u00b7 \u03c3)2B0(\u03c3 + ep \u2212 eq)B0(\u03c3) = \u2212B0(\u03c3 + ep)B0(\u03c3 \u2212 eq) . (4.4)\nNow we suppose that B0(\u03c3) = f(\u03c3) \u220f r\u2208R 1\nG(1+r\u00b7\u03c3) . First of all we show that of ratios of \u0393functions which arise from manipulating the Barnes\u2019 G-functions cancels. Namely, consider, for \u03b2 \u2208 Q\u2228 + \u03bb\u2228 in a general Lie algebra\n\u0393\u0302(\u03b2) := \u220f\n\u03b1\u2208R,n\u22651 \u03b1\u00b7\u03b2=n\n( \u0393[\u2212\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c3] \u0393[\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c3] )n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nwhich is the product of \u0393-functions in (3.10).

This discussion is valid for all Lie algebras. For the An case, the LHS of (4.4), after discarding products of \u0393-functions, becomes\n(1 + \u03c3p \u2212 \u03c3q)2 f(\u03c3 + ep \u2212 eq)f(\u03c3) \u2212(\u03c3p \u2212 \u03c3q)2(1 + \u03c3p \u2212 \u03c3q)2 \u220f \u03b2\u00b7(ep\u2212eq)=1 \u03b2 \u00b7 \u03c3 = \u2212 f(\u03c3 + ep \u2212 eq)f(\u03c3) (\u03c3p \u2212 \u03c3q)2 \u220f p 6=k 6=q (\u03c32p \u2212 \u03c32k)(\u03c32k \u2212 \u03c32q ) .\nThis has to equal the RHS\n\u2212 f(\u03c3 + ep)\u220f k 6=p (\u03c32p \u2212 \u03c32k) f(\u03c3 \u2212 eq)\u220f k 6=q (\u03c32k \u2212 \u03c32q ) .\nSimple arithmetics converts this to f(\u03c3 + ep \u2212 eq)f(\u03c3) = f(\u03c3 + ep)f(\u03c3 \u2212 eq) which implies that f is periodic on the lattice. The asymptotic condition (3.7) reads as f \u223c 1 when \u03c3 \u2192\u221e, so that f = 1.\nThe higher order terms in t, t\u03c31 , ..., t\u03c3n provide the recursion relations\nk2Zk(\u03c3) = \u2212 \u2211\nn2+j1+j2=k n\u2208e1+Q, j1,2<k\nB0(\u03c3 \u00b1 n) B0(\u03c3)2 Zj2(\u03c3 \u2212 n)Zj1(\u03c3 + n)\n+ \u2211\nn2+i1+i2=k n\u2208Q, i1,2<k\n(i1 \u2212 i2 + 2n \u00b7 \u03c3)2 B0(\u03c3 \u00b1 n) B0(\u03c3)2 Zi1(\u03c3 + n)Zi2(\u03c3 \u2212 n) ,\nwhere B0(\u03c3) is given by (3.8). In particular, k = 1 gives the simple expression\nZ1(\u03c3) = \u2212 n+1\u2211 i=1 B0(\u03c3 \u00b1 ei) B0(\u03c3)2 = (\u22121)n+1 n+1\u2211 i=1 1\u220f j 6=i(\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3j)2 .\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nUpon abbreviating \u03c3ij = \u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3j , the k = 2 term gives\nZ2(\u03c3) = \u2212 1\n4 n+1\u2211 i=1 B0(\u03c3 \u00b1 ei) B0(\u03c3)2 [Z1(\u03c3 + ei) + Z1(\u03c3 \u2212 ei)] + n+1\u2211 i<j (\u03c3i \u2212 \u03c3j)2 B0(\u03c3 \u00b1 (ei \u2212 ej)) B0(\u03c3)2\nwhich we can write as\nZ2(\u03c3) = 1\n4 \u2211 i 1\u220f j 6=i \u03c3 2 ij (\u2211 k 1\u220f l 6=k(\u03c3kl + \u03b4kl \u2212 \u03b4li)2 + 1\u220f l 6=k(\u03c3kl \u2212 \u03b4kl + \u03b4li)2 )\n\u2212 \u2211 i<j\n1 (\u03c3ij + 1)2(\u03c3ij \u2212 1)2\u03c32ij \u220f i 6=k 6=j \u03c3 2 ik\u03c3 2 jk\n= 1\n4 \u2211 i 1\u220f k 6=i \u03c3 2 ki \u00b7 \u220f k 6=i(\u03c3ki \u2212 1)2 + 1 4 \u2211 i 1\u220f k 6=i \u03c3 2 ki \u00b7 \u220f k 6=i(\u03c3ki + 1) 2\n+ \u2211 i<j \u03c32ij (\u03c32ij \u2212 1)2 1\u220f k 6=i \u03c3 2 ki \u00b7 \u220f k 6=j \u03c3 2 kj\nwhere in the second step we cancelled the off-diagonal terms in the double product, to simplify the comparison with Nekrasov formulae for k = 2 for 1 = \u2212 2 = 1. Indeed, the three sums above correspond exactly to ZSU(n+1)(~Y ) of (B.1) with ~Y having two boxes or two boxes in the i-th position and the last double sum is over ~Y such that one box is in the i-th and another in the j-th position. These are all the possible tuples ~Y such that |~Y | = 2. To summarise, the above coincide with one and two instanton contributions to the SU(n+ 1) Nekrasov partition function as computed from supersymmetric localization [46, 47]. Let us remark that the use of the \u03c4 -system (4.1) provides a completely independent tool to compute all instanton corrections just starting from the asymptotic behaviour (3.7). This procedure extends to all classical groups.\n4.2 Bn, Dn\nDue to our strategy of solving the problem by attaching Kiev Ans\u00e4tze to nodes corresponding to minuscule coweights, we treat the algebras Bn and Dn simultaneously. The coroot lattices are likewise the same, so the only difference between Bn to Dn is the asymptotic condition the extra roots of Bn impose.\n\u03c40\n\u03c41\n\u03c42 \u03c43 \u03c4n\u22123\n\u03c4n\u22122\n\u03c4n\u22121\n\u03c4n\nDn is a simply laced algebra, whose coroot lattice is the checkerboard lattice Q = Q\u2228 = { \u2211n i=1 ciei| \u2211n i=1 ci \u2208 2Z}. In this section we consider only n \u2265 4 and leave the special cases\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nof n = 2, 3 to the appendix D. There are four minuscule weights, \u03bb0 = (0n), \u03bb1 = (1, 0n\u22121), \u03bbn\u22121 = (( 1 2) n\u22121,\u221212), \u03bbn = (( 1 2) n\u22121,+12) and these correspond to the \"legs\" of the affine diagram. Whatever the rank we consider, we always have the consistency conditions\nD2(\u03c40) = D 2(\u03c41), D 2(\u03c4n\u22121) = D 2(\u03c4n) (4.5)\nwhich immediately follow from the equations D2(\u03c40) = \u2212t1/2n\u03c42, D2(\u03c41) = \u2212t1/2n\u03c42 and the analogue ones at the other end of the diagram. The second consistency condition is morally just the first one with \u03c3 shifted by ((12)\nn). In the special case n = 4 we have a further equality, due to the enhanced symmetry of D4,\nD2(\u03c40) = D 2(\u03c41) = D 2(\u03c43) = D 2(\u03c44).\nPractically, however, the first condition is sufficient to solve the problem.\n\u03c40\n\u03c41\n\u03c42 \u03c43 \u03c4n\u22122 \u03c4n\u22121 \u03c4n\nBn is not simply laced. In addition to the roots of the corresponding Dn, {ei \u00b1 ej}i 6=j , it has shorter roots {ei}. This is the first case, however, in which we have to worry about looking at the Langlands dual algebra, and send each root to the coroot via R 3 \u03b1 7\u2192 2\u03b1/(\u03b1\u00b7\u03b1) \u2208 R\u2228. Therefore, the extended Dynkin diagram above has reversed arrows compared to the usual, since the roots {ei} get rescaled to {2ei}. The coroot lattice is still the checkerboard lattice Q\u2228 = { \u2211n i=1 ciei| \u2211n i=1 ci \u2208 2Z} of Dn, and the two minuscule weights are \u03bb \u2228 0 = (0\nn) and \u03bb\u22281 = (1, 0\nn\u22121), corresponding to the \"antennae\" of the new diagram, provided n > 3. The additional Z2 symmetry of Dn is broken. The \u03c4 -system coincides with that of Dn+1, with the modification that (i) there is no \u03c4n+1 node and (ii) that\nD2(\u03c4n\u22121) = \u22122t 1 2n\u22121 \u03c4n\u22122\u03c4n, D 2(\u03c4n) = \u2212t 1 2n\u22121 \u03c42n\u22121.\nThe case n = 3 is discussed separately along with the algebra C2 in section 4.3.2. We limit the present discussion to n > 3 so the analysis proceeds as for Dn, except we can only consider the first equation in (4.5). This unifies the approach to both Dn and Bn. Explicitly, inserting\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n(3.6) and \u03c41(\u03c3|t) = \u03c40(\u03c3 + \u03bb1|t) into the first equation of (4.5) we get\u2211 n1,n2\u2208Q\u2228 i1,i2\u22650 e2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121(n1+n2)\u00b7\u03b7t 1 2 n21+ 1 2 n22+i1+i2+\u03c3\u00b7(n1+n2)\n( 1\n2 n21 \u2212\n1 2 n22 + i1 \u2212 i2 + \u03c3 \u00b7 (n1 \u2212 n2) )2 B0(\u03c3 + n1)B0(\u03c3 + n2)Zi1(\u03c3 + n1)Zi2(\u03c3 + n2)\n= \u2211\nm1,m2\u2208Q\u2228 j1,j2\u22650\ne2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121(m1+m2)\u00b7\u03b7t1+ 1 2 m21+ 1 2 m22+\u03bb1\u00b7(m1+m2)+j1+j2+\u03c3\u00b7(m1+m2+2\u03bb1)\n( 1\n2 m21 \u2212\n1 2 m22 + j1 \u2212 j2 + (\u03c3 + \u03bb1) \u00b7 (m1 \u2212m2) )2 B0(\u03c3 + m1 + \u03bb1)B0(\u03c3 + m2 + \u03bb1)Zj1(\u03c3 + m1 + \u03bb1)Zj2(\u03c3 + m2 + \u03bb1)\nIn the following, p, q = 1, ..., n, p 6= q, and following the discussion in the previous section, we look for the lowest terms in powers of t and {t\u03c3i}. Explicitly, the term to consider is t1+\u03c3\u00b7(ep+eq), which we got by putting n1 = ep + eq and n2 = 0 on the LHS, up to symmetry. To get this term we need to impose m1 = ep \u2212 e1, m2 = eq \u2212 e1 on the RHS, with all i\u2019s and j\u2019s vanishing. The functional equation we get, analogous to (4.4), is\n(1 + (ep + eq) \u00b7 \u03c3)2B0(\u03c3)B0(\u03c3 + ep + eq) = ((ep \u2212 eq) \u00b7 \u03c3)2B0(\u03c3 + ep)B0(\u03c3 + eq) . (4.6)\nThe two cases are distinguished by the different asymptotic conditions (3.7) the root systems impose. Indeed, we have\nB [Dn] 0 (\u03c3) = n\u220f i<j\n1\nG(1\u00b1 \u03c3i \u00b1 \u03c3j)\nB [Bn] 0 (\u03c3) = ( n\u220f k=1\n1\nG(1\u00b1 \u03c3k)\n) B\n[Dn] 0 (\u03c3)\nOne can show that the large \u03c3 asymptotics of these different solutions are consistent with the full \u03c4 system, not only the reduced consistency condition we are considering. Next, since the equation and the Ansatz are the same, the recursion relations are as well, and turn out to be\nk2Zk(\u03c3) = \u2211\n(n\u2212\u03bb1)2+j1+j2=k n\u2208\u03bb1+Q\u2228 ,j1,2<k\nZj1(\u03c3 + n)Zj2(\u03c3 \u2212 n) (j1 \u2212 j2 + 2n \u00b7 \u03c3) 2 B0(\u03c3 \u00b1 n)\nB0(\u03c3)2\n\u2212 \u2211\nn2+i1+i2=k n\u2208Q\u2228, i1,2<k\nZj1(\u03c3 + n)\u00d7 Zj2(\u03c3 \u2212 n) (i1 \u2212 i2 + 2n \u00b7 \u03c3) 2 B0(\u03c3 \u00b1 n)\nB0(\u03c3)2 (4.7)\nThis result is in line with the contour integral formulae for the relevant Nekrasov partition functions. Indeed the poles in the Dn and Bn cases are the same, but with different residues,\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nas noticed in [48]. From the above recursion relation we can compute the 1-instanton terms\nZ1(\u03c3) = n\u2211 k=1 4\u03c32k B0(\u03c3 \u00b1 ek) B0(\u03c3)2 =  \u2211n k=1 \u22124\u220f j 6=k (\u03c32k\u2212\u03c3 2 j ) 2 , Bn \u2211n k=1\n4\u03c32k\u220f j 6=k (\u03c32k\u2212\u03c3 2 j ) 2 , Dn\nand the 2-instantons Z2(\u03c3) = \u2211\n\u03b1\u2208Q\u2228,\u03b12=2\n\u22121 (\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c3)2((\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c3)2 \u2212 1)2 \u220f \u03b2\u00b7\u03b1=1 (\u03b2 \u00b7 \u03c3)2\n+ n\u2211 k=1 Z1(\u03c3 + ek)(\u03c3k + 1 2) 2 + Z1(\u03c3 \u2212 ek)(\u03c3k \u2212 12) 2\u220f\n\u03b2\u00b7ek=\u00b11 (\u03b2 \u00b7 \u03c3)\nand so on. These are easily compared to the instanton counting from appendix B, and the appendix of [48] where the results were first presented.\n4.3 Cn\n\u03c40 \u03c41 \u03c42 \u03c4n\u22122 \u03c4n\u22121 \u03c4n\nHere there is a potential issue of normalizing the roots, so we must make note of our conventions. In writing (3.6) we have stressed that the bilinear form is fixed by demanding |\u03b1|2 = 2 for all long roots \u03b1. If we decide to choose roots of Cn as {Dn roots} \u222a {\u00b12ei}, clearly |2ei|2 = 4. So we should normalize them as {\u00b1 1\u221a2ei \u00b1 1\u221a 2 ej} \u222a {\u00b1 \u221a 2ei}. The dual lattice\nis then Q\u2228 = \u221a 2Zn. In literature, the factors of \u221a\n2 are sometimes avoided, which can be accommodated in this approach by rescaling time and working with\n\u03c4i = \u2211\nm\u2208Zn+\u03bb\u2228i\nem\u00b7\u03b7t 1 2 \u2211n i=1(\u03c3i+mi) 2 B(\u03c3 + m| \u221a t) (4.8)\nThe minuscule weights are \u03bb0 = 0 and \u03bbn = (( 1\u221a2) n). Bilinear relations are only available for n = 1, 2, where accidental isomorphisms map the algebras to those already considered. We explore the lower ranks explicitly up to and including C4. As for the analysis of the higher order algebras, these produce more complicated recurrence relations to be solved by a case by case analysis, unlike in the A,B,D types which allow for a unified treatment. We performed explicit checks for C5 and C6 up to one-instanton, again in agreement with [48]."

We now turn to non-classical Lie algebras and describe novel ways of obtaining instanton volumes where instanton counting is unavailable. We note that yet another way to obtain them is via blowup relations, likewise conjectural at time of writing, and these serve as a cross-check. They are also described in appendix B. Computationally, however, the equations we find are quicker, because they only involve instanton volumes at the same \u2126-background. We begin with the simplest simply laced exceptional Lie algebra, E6.\n\u03c40\n\u03c41 \u03c42 \u03c43\n\u03c44\n\u03c45 \u03c46\nDue to the similarities of the root systems of the E-type algebras, we will give a brief overview of E8 at this point and describe the others as its reductions. The root system is the union of D8 roots {ei \u00b1 ej}i 6=j and (x1, ..., x8) \u2208 R8 of length 2 such that all xi \u2208 Z + 12 and\u2211\ni xi is even. The coroot lattice can be obtained from two cosets of the D8 one as Q [E8] = Q[D8] \u222a ( Q[E8] + ((12) n\u22121,\u221212) ) . E6 is then obtained by projecting all of the roots to have the last three coordinates equal, (x1, ..., x5, x6, x6, x6). Clearly, this forces the D8-type roots to an\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nembedding of D5, with the last three coordinates zero. Unlike E8, which is unimodular and has no minuscule coweights, E6 has three: \u03bb0 = 0, \u03bb1 = (1, 04, (\u221213) 3), and \u03bb6 = (05, (\u221223) 3).

In, \u03bb21 = 32 , so in the analogue of (4.16) we end up with 4 2\u03bb 2 1 = 3 in pure powers of t. Likewise, we have even powers of \u03c41, and 2\u03bb1 \u2208 Q. Both of these lead to well defined analogues of (4.16) and (4.17). The lowest possible order in t is t3. If we pick p1, ..., p6 to be a permutation of {1, ..., 6}, looking at powers of t3+\u03c3\u00b7(2ep1+2ep2+2ep3 ) we get\nB0(\u03c3) 3\u220f i<j (1 + \u03c3pi + \u03c3pj ) 2(\u03c3pi \u2212 \u03c3pj )2B0(\u03c3 + epi + epj )\n= B0(\u03c3 + \u03b4 \u2212 e1 \u2212 ep4 \u2212 ep5 \u2212 ep6) 3\u220f i<j (\u2212\u03b4i,1 + \u03c3pi \u00b1 \u03c3pj )2 3\u220f i=1 B0(\u03c3 + \u03b4 \u2212 e1 \u2212 epi+3)\nwith \u03b4 := ((12) 8) as above. Clearly, the only lattice points satisfying the quadratic constraint while summing up to 2(ep1 +ep2 +ep3) are ep1 +ep2 , ep1 +ep3 , ep2 +ep3 and zero, while the ones on the shifted lattice, which can be inferred from the above equation, are similarly unique up to permutation.

Comparing other powers, i.e. t3+ep1+ep2 and t3 yields different expressions for Z1(\u03c3). To obtain the two instanton term, we can look at t4+2ep1+ep2+ep3 . Similarly to the previous case, we obtain a ratio of a degree 166 to one of 198 in C[\u03c37]. The large-\u03c3 limit conforms to the expected limit from appendix C.\n4.6 E8\n\u03c40\u03c41\u03c42\u03c43\u03c44\u03c45\n\u03c46\n\u03c47\u03c48\nFor the exceptional algebra E8 we obtain the system\nY 6(\u03c40) = Y 3(\u03c48) (4.25)\n\u03c46D 2(\u03c48) = Y 7(\u03c40) (4.26)\nD2(\u03c46) = Y 6(\u03c40) (4.27)\nHere, \u03c48 needs to be determined from (4.25), and then fed into (4.27), once \u03c46 has been eliminated using (4.26).

As can be seen from the (dual) extended Dynkin diagram, eliminating the node corresponding to \u03c42 leaves us with a copy of A2, which is a subalgebra which we previously embedded into a hyperplane orthogonal to (1, 1, 1) in R3. We will use the same embedding for G2, with \u03c31 + \u03c32 + \u03c33 = 0. Besides the 6 roots of A2, G2 has 6 other roots of the form ep1 + ep2 \u2212 2ep3 for p1,2,3 permutations of {1, 2, 3}. In the normalization where G2\u2019s longest roots have length 2, the coroot lattice is the span Q\u2228 = Z 1\u221a\n3 (\u22122, 1, 1)\u2295Z\n\u221a 3(1,\u22121, 0) - we are not aware of a simpler definition.

The 1-instanton contribution is obtained by considering the coefficient of the next order t3+\u03c3\u00b7( \u221a 3,0,\u2212 \u221a 3) term: curiously, all B0(\u03c3) factors drop out and we obtain just\nZ1(\u03c3) [G2] = \u2212 486 (\u03c31 + \u03c32 \u2212 2\u03c33)2(\u03c31 \u2212 2\u03c32 + \u03c33)2(\u22122\u03c31 + \u03c32 + \u03c33)2 \u03c33=\u2212\u03c31\u2212\u03c32= \u2212 3 2\u03c321\u03c3 2 2(\u03c31 + \u03c32) 2\nThis expression is in agreement with (4.39) in [49] when Q = 0 and their a1 = (\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c32)/ \u221a 6, a2 = (\u03c31 + \u03c32)/ \u221a\n3 as well as with the blowup-formula from B. The next order in t, t4+\u03c3\u00b7( \u221a 3,0,\u2212 \u221a 3), gives the 2-instanton term Z2(\u03c3)[G2]|\u03c33=\u2212\u03c31\u2212\u03c32 =\n3 ( 9\u03c341 ( 6\u03c322 + 1 ) + 18\u03c331 ( 6\u03c332 + \u03c32 ) + 3\u03c321 ( 18\u03c342 + 9\u03c3 2 2 \u2212 2 ) + 6\u03c31\u03c32 ( 3\u03c322 \u2212 1 ) + ( 1\u2212 3\u03c322 )2) \u03c321 ( 1\u2212 3\u03c321 )2 \u03c322 ( 1\u2212 3\u03c322 )2 (\u03c31 + \u03c32)2 (1\u2212 3(\u03c31 + \u03c32)2)2\nwhich agrees with the expression obtained from the blowup formula of appendix B. Z3(\u03c3) can be obtained by looking at t5+\u03c3\u00b7(4,5,\u22121)/ \u221a 3, although it is much to cumbersome to display. At this point, comparison with the blowup formula again becomes impossible, and we have to be content with checking that the large-\u03c3 limit of appendix C is correct.\n4.8 F4\n\u03c40 \u03c41 \u03c42 \u03c43 \u03c44\nF4 is another non-simply laced unimodular exceptional algebra. As such, we have to express the system of equations in terms of the single tau function \u03c40 associated to the extended node. From the system\nD2(\u03c40) = \u2212t1/9\u03c41, D2(\u03c41) = \u2212t1/9\u03c40\u03c42, D2(\u03c42) = \u2212t1/9\u03c41\u03c43 D2(\u03c43) = \u2212t1/9\u03c422 \u03c44, D2(\u03c44) = \u2212t1/9\u03c43\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nwe obtain the single equation\nD2( Y 5(\u03c40)\nY 3(\u03c40) ) = \u22128t2Y 4(\u03c40) (4.34)\nLike for E8, we leave it as it is, being beyond our computational power.\n5 Twisted affine Lie algebras: radial Bullough-Dodd and BC1\n\u03c40 \u03c41\nWe consider the twisted affine Lie algebra, called either A(2)2n or BCn, with roots of three different lengths inherited from a folding of affine D2n+2; the roots are \u00b1ek, \u00b1ej \u00b1 ek as well as \u00b12ek of lengths 1, 2, 4 respectively3. The simplest case n = 1 is slightly exceptional in this regard. Indeed, it comes from a quotient of affine D4 by its order 4 automorphism and possessing no middle roots. It gives us\nD2(\u03c40) = \u2212 1\n2 t1/3\u03c41\nD2(\u03c41) = \u22122t1/3\u03c440\nWe redefine t 7\u2192 32\u22124t2 from which we obtain the single equation\nY 3(\u03c40) = \u22126t2\u03c430 (5.1)\nsuitable for inserting an Ansatz analogous to the one used for the A1 case,\n\u03c40(\u03c3, \u03b7|t) = \u2211\nn\u2208Z,i\u2208N0\ne2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121\u03b7nt(\u03c3+n) 2+iB0(\u03c3 + n)Zi(\u03c3 + n), (5.2)\nyielding from (5.1) the equation\n\u2211 n1,2,3\u2208Z i1,2,3\u2208N 3\u220f k=1 e2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121\u03b7nkt(\u03c3+nk) 2+ikB0(\u03c3 + nk)Zik(\u03c3 + nk)\n( \u220f k1<k2 (n2k1 + ik1 \u2212 n 2 k2 \u2212 ik2 + 2(nk1 \u2212 nk2)\u03c3) 2 + 6t2 ) = 0 . (5.3)\nThe lowest order terms are the ones proportional to t2. For terms proportional to the 6t2, the solution has no shifts or instanton numbers, while for rest of the the only nonvanishing\n3Note that the BC nomenclature refers to both sets of roots \u00b1ek and \u00b12ek, which are peculiar to algebras of Bn and Cn respectively, being present along with the usual roots of Dn algebras.\n\u2013 28 \u2013\npossibilities are n1 = 1, n2 = \u22121, n3 = 0 and permutations. After a cancellation of a B0(\u03c3) factor, this leads to\n4\u03c32 ( 1\u2212 4\u03c32 )2 B0(\u03c3 \u00b1 1) = B0(\u03c3)2 (5.4)\nAt this point we have to discuss what kind of asymptotics would be suitable. Notice that we have the roots \u00b12. If we identify these with the ones of the usual SU(2) adjoint representation, then the roots \u00b11 correspond to the fundamental representation. Both representations are obtained from the folding of a pure D4 Super Yang-Mills theory. As the parent theory has no mass parameters, it is natural to consider asymptotic conditions corresponding to an SU(2) with one massless fundamental flavor, i.e.\nlog(B0) \u223c 1 4 (\u03c3)2 log (\u03c3)2 \u2212 1 4 (2\u03c3)2 log (2\u03c3)2\nWe find that the solution to equation (5.4) with the appropriate asymptotics is\nB0(\u03c3) = G(1\u00b1 \u03c3) G(1\u00b1 2\u03c3)\n(5.5)\nFurther, by looking at t2k+2\u03c3 terms in (5), we find that there is a unique term proportional to\n(2k \u2212 1)2(1\u2212 2k + 2\u03c3)2(1 + 2\u03c3)2B0(\u03c3 + 1)B0(\u03c3)Z2k\u22121(\u03c3) (5.6)\nwhich comes from a factor from the Kiev Ansatz with t1+2\u03c3, one with no shifts, and another with only an instanton contribution t2k\u22121. All the other terms are necessarily combinations of terms proportional to Z2k\u2032\u22121 with k\u2032 < k. To get t2k+2\u03c3 have to solve\nn1 + n2 + n3 = 1 (5.7) n21 + n 2 2 + n 2 3 + i1 + i2 + i3 + (2) = 2k (5.8)\nThe first equation, however, implies n21 + n22 + n23 is odd, and so one of the i\u2019s always has to be odd and accordingly Z2k\u22121 = 0. Indeed, for k = 1 there is only one such term possible and we find that it has to vanish due to (5), so by induction we can conclude that\nZodd(\u03c3) = 0.\nFor the rest we find\nZ2(\u03c3) = \u2212 3\n22 (1\u2212 4\u03c32)2 Z4(\u03c3) = 9 ( 4\u03c32 + 1 ) 27\u03c32 (1\u2212 4\u03c32)2 (9\u2212 4\u03c32)2 Z6(\u03c3) = \u2212 576\u03c36 \u2212 2160\u03c34 + 5324\u03c32 + 75\n29\u03c32 (1\u2212 4\u03c32)4 (9\u2212 4\u03c32) (25\u2212 4\u03c32) Z8(\u03c3) = 3 ( 4608\u03c310 \u2212 78336\u03c38 + 482560\u03c36 \u2212 615824\u03c34 + 243742\u03c32 + 62475 ) 216\u03c32 (1\u2212 \u03c32)2 (1\u2212 4\u03c32)4 (9\u2212 4\u03c32)2 (25\u2212 4\u03c32)2 (49\u2212 4\u03c32)2\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nWe can recognize here exactly the SU(2) Nekrasov functions with one massless flavor in the fundamental representation. Note that, starting from PIII2 in the form\nq\u0308 = q\u03072 q(t) \u2212 q\u0307 t \u2212 (1\u2212 2\u03b8)q\u0307 2 t + q3 \u2212 2 t2\nand setting q = t\u22122/3 exp{w}, \u03b8 = 1/2 gives us\n\u22022log tw = t 2/3(e2w \u2212 2e\u2212w)\nSetting w = a+ 2(\u03c3 \u2212 1/6) log t+X(t), since \u03c1/h\u2228 = 1/6, gives us\n\u22022log tX = e 2at4\u03c3e2X \u2212 2eat1\u22122\u03c3e\u2212X\nThis cannot be obtained by directly applying (2.1) to this affine root system. Instead we must start from D4 and require a solution of the form \u03c61 = \u03c64 = 0, \u03c63 = \u2212\u03c62 Let us comment on other interesting directions to investigate further and look at the equation for the surviving degree of freedom. This is exactly the folding which gives the diagram BC1 depicted at the beginning of this subsection. Solving the equation we find\nX(\u03c3, a|t) = 2 log \u03c40(\u03c3, a\u0303| \u221a \u22121t)\u2212 log \u03c41(\u03c3, a|t)\nwhere \u22022log t log \u03c41(\u03c3, a|t) = e2at4\u03c3e2X , normalized such that \u03c41(\u03c3, a|0) = 1, \u03c40 is (5.2) with perturbative term (5.5), first four instanton terms we found and the initial condition\na\u0303 = a\u2212 log (\n\u0393(1\u2212 2\u03c3)2\u0393(\u03c3) \u0393(2\u03c3)2\u0393(1\u2212 \u03c3)\n) \u2212 i\u03c0\u03c3 + i\u03c0\n2\nNote that this is different from the tau function defined in (2.25), (2.29) of [50].\n\u03c40 \u03c41 \u03c42\nThe slightly more general case of n = 2 gives us the system\nD2(\u03c40) = \u2212 1\n2 t1/5\u03c41\nD2(\u03c41) = \u2212t1/5\u03c420 \u03c42 D2(\u03c42) = \u22122t1/5\u03c421\nfrom which we obtain the single equation\n\u03c420Y 4(\u03c40)\u2212 (Y 3(\u03c40))2 = \u2212\n1 2 t\u03c440D 2(\u03c40) (5.9)\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nThe lattice is Q\u2228 = Z2, rescaled by a factor of \u221a\n2, as the underlying finite root system is C2. Examining the lowest order terms we find that from the Ansatz, where the rescaling is taken care of by fractional t,\n\u03c40(\u03c3,\u03b7|t) = \u2211\nn\u2208Z2, i\u2208N0/2\ne2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121n\u00b7\u03b7t 1 2 (\u03c3+n)2+iB0(\u03c3 + n)Z2i(\u03c3 + n)\nwe find that Z1(\u03c3) should vanish again. Looking at the lowest order gives us the equation\n16 (2\u03c31 + 1) 2 (\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c32) 2\u03c322 (\u03c31 + \u03c32) 2 (2\u03c32 \u2212 1) 2 (2\u03c32 + 1) 2\n\u00d7B0(\u03c3)B0(\u03c3 + e1)B0(\u03c3 + e2)B0(\u03c3 \u2212 e2) = \u2212 (2\u03c31 + 1) 2B0(\u03c3)3B0(\u03c3 + e1)\nwith the solution B0(\u03c3) =\nG(1\u00b1 \u03c31)G(1\u00b1 \u03c32) G(1\u00b1 2\u03c31)G(1\u00b1 2\u03c32)G(1\u00b1 \u03c31 \u00b1 \u03c32)\nand further we find\nZ2(\u03c3) = 24\u03c341 \u2212 32\u03c322\u03c321 \u2212 4\u03c321 + 24\u03c342 \u2212 4\u03c322 + 1\n2 (2\u03c31 \u2212 1) 2 (2\u03c31 + 1) 2 (\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c32) 2 (\u03c31 + \u03c32) 2 (2\u03c32 \u2212 1) 2 (2\u03c32 + 1) 2\nWe do not have at present a clear 4D gauge theory interpretation for this case.\n6 SU(2)n linear quiver gauge theories\nIn this section we will be focusing on the case of linear SU(2)\u00d7n quivers in the pure, nonconformal case. Our proposal is the following modification of the SU(2) system\n\u03c420\u2202log t1\u2202log tn log \u03c40 = \u2212t 1/4 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 t 1/4 n \u03c4 2 1 (6.1) \u03c421\u2202log t1\u2202log tn log \u03c41 = \u2212t 1/4 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 t 1/4 n \u03c4 2 0 (6.2)\nNotice that, in the case n > 2, the system of equations explicitely describes only the dynamics associated to the irregular punctures moduli. As we will see in the following, the dependence on the moduli of the regular punctures is uniquely fixed by suitable asymptotic conditions on the solutions. These are obtained in the limiting cases of identity punctures leading to trivial monodromy or degenerating limits dividing the punctured Riemann sphere into disconnected components. We solve to above equations in terms of the following generalised SU(2) quiver Kiev Ansatz \u03c4j({\u03c3k}, {\u03b7k}|t1, ..., tn) = \u2211\nn1,...,nk\u2208 j2+Z i1,...,in\u2208N0\nn\u220f l=1 ( e2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121\u03b7l\u00b7nlt (\u03c3l+nl) 2+il l ) B0({\u03c3k+nk})Zi1,...,in({\u03c3k+nk})\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nwhere Z0,...,0 \u2261 1. Notice that the shift is simultaneous in all the lattices as there is no mixing. In the next subsection, by imposing appropriate asymptotic conditions, we will find that B0({\u03c3k + nk}) = Bquiver({\u03c3k + nk}) where\nBquiver({\u03c3k}) =\nn\u22121\u220f i=1\nG(1 +mi,i+1 + \u03c3i \u00b1 \u03c3i+1)G(1 +mi,i+1 \u2212 \u03c3i \u00b1 \u03c3i+1) n\u220f k=1 G(1\u00b1 2\u03c3k)\nwhere mi,j \u2208 C are arbitrary bifundamental masses. We conjecture that these one-loop terms, along with the recursion relations arising from (6.1) and suitable additional constraints, lead to the identification\nZi1,...,in({\u03c3k}) = \u2211\n(~Y1,...,~Yn) |Yk,1|+|Yk,2|=ik\n\u220fn\u22121 i=1 Zbifund.(\u03c3i,\n~Yi, \u03c3i+1, ~Yi+1,mi,i+1)\u220fn i=1 Zbifund.(\u03c3i, ~Yi, \u03c3i, ~Yi, 0)\nwhere Zbifund. is defined in Appendix B."

            "text": "The one instanton contributions can be obtained in a similar way. Let us focus on the detailed analysis of the simplest cases, starting with that of n = 2. To obtain the instanton terms, we need to impose correct boundary conditions.\n\u2022 The first condition is the one corresponding to the identity puncture. This implies that when m1,2 = 0, by setting \u03c31 = \u03c32 kills off-diagonal terms in the expansion of the quiver tau function. Once we equate t1 = t2, the solution has to equal that of pure SU(2) as the equation it solves is the same. 4 A detailed proof of this is provided in Appendix B.\n\u2022 The second condition is the one associated to the dividing degeneration limit. This is obtained by sending m1,2 \u2192\u221e while scaling t1,2 7\u2192 t1,2/m21,2, inducing the factorization\nZk1,k2(\u03c31, \u03c32) ( t1 m1,2 )k1 ( t2 m1,2 )k2 \u2192 Zk1(\u03c31)Zk2(\u03c32)t k1 1 t k2 2\nThis is consistent with (6.1). Indeed, under the scaling itself, the RHS goes to zero as 1/m1,2, while, the LHS automatically vanishes if the tau function factorizes.\nThe equation for n = 2 yields two bilinear equations related one to the other by \u03c3i 7\u2192 \u03c3i+1/2 symmetry:\u2211 n,m\u2208Z2 i1,i2\u22650 e2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121(n+m)\u00b7\u03b7t (\u03c31+n1)2+i1+(\u03c32+n2)2+i2 1 t (\u03c31+m1)2+j1+(\u03c32+m2)2+j2 2\n\u00d7 (i1 \u2212 i2 + (n1 \u2212 n2)(n1 + n2 + 2\u03c31)) (j1 \u2212 j2 + (m1 \u2212m2)(m1 +m2 + 2\u03c32)) \u00d7B0(\u03c31 + n1, \u03c32 +m1)B0(\u03c31 + n2, \u03c32 +m2)Zi1,j1(\u03c31 + n1, \u03c32 +m1)Zi2,j2(\u03c31 + n2, \u03c32 +m2)\n= \u2212 \u2211\nn,m\u2208Z2 i1,i2\u22650\ne2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121(n+m)\u00b7\u03b7t\n1+(\u03c31+n1)2+\u03c31+n1+i1+(\u03c32+n2)2+\u03c32+n2+i2 1 t 1+(\u03c31+m1)2+\u03c31+m1+j1+(\u03c32+m2)2+\u03c32+m2+j2 2\n\u00d7B0(\u03c31 + n1 + 1\n2 , \u03c32 +m1 +\n1 2 )B0(\u03c31 + n2 + 1 2 , \u03c32 +m2 + 1 2 )\n\u00d7 Zi1,j1(\u03c31 + n1 + 1\n2 , \u03c32 +m1 +\n1 2 )Zi2,j2(\u03c31 + n2 + 1 2 , \u03c32 +m2 + 1 2 )\nThe t1t1+2\u03c322 term gives\nZ1,0(\u03c31, \u03c32 + 1)\u2212 Z1,0(\u03c31, \u03c32) = \u2212 2B0(\u03c31 +\n1 2 , \u03c32 + 1 2)B0(\u03c31 \u2212 1 2 , \u03c32 + 1 2)\n(1 + 2\u03c32)B0(\u03c31, \u03c32)B0(\u03c31, \u03c32 + 1) = \u22121 + 2\u03c32 2\u03c321\n4In the D-brane language, this condition can be seen most easily from the Hanany-Witten brane setup - this is the point at which the theory touches the Higgs branch and the gauge group gets broken down to the diagonal. There is no bifundamental, and the branes are fixed to move in unison, ignoring the intermediate NS5 brane.\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nonce we put B0 = Bquiver.

Finally, the t1+2\u03c311 t 1+2\u03c32 2 term gets us\nZ1,1(\u03c31, \u03c32)\u2212 Z1,0(\u03c31, \u03c32)Z0,1(\u03c31, \u03c32)\n= 2 B0(\u03c31 +\n1 2 , \u03c32 \u2212 1 2)B0(\u03c31 \u2212 1 2 , \u03c32 + 1 2) +B0(\u03c31 + 1 2 , \u03c32 + 1 2)B0(\u03c31 \u2212 1 2 , \u03c32 \u2212 1 2)\nB0(\u03c31, \u03c32)2\n= \u2212 m21,2 \u2212 \u03c321 \u2212 \u03c322\n4\u03c321\u03c3 2 2\ngiving the correct mixed 2-instanton term\nZ1,1(\u03c31, \u03c32) = m21,2(m 2 1,2 \u2212 1) + \u03c321 + \u03c322 \u2212 (\u03c321 \u2212 \u03c322)2\n4\u03c321\u03c3 2 2\nIn general, we find that the coefficients of the form Zk,0(\u03c3) satisfy simple recurrence relations, while mixed terms are determined uniquely. We checked agreement with instanton counting up to Z3,3(\u03c3). For the SU(2)3 quiver, the boundary conditions are the logical extension of the above.\n\u2022 When m1,2 = 0, setting \u03c31 = \u03c32 has to kill all terms Zk1,k2,k3 with k1 6= k2. Further, if we put t1 7\u2192 t1/21 and t2 7\u2192 t\n1/2 1 , then(\nZk1,k2,k3(\u03c31, \u03c31, \u03c33)|m1,2=0 ) tk11 t k2 2 t k3 3 = Zk1,k3(\u03c31, \u03c33)t k1tk33\nwhere on the RHS we have the partition functions of the SU(2)2 quiver. Similar considerations apply if m2,3 = 0 and \u03c32 = \u03c33. Clearly, at this point previous considerations apply, and we are free to set the remaining mass to zero and reach pure SU(2) again.\n\u2022 We can decouple bifundamental hypermultiplets individually. For instance, by sending m1,2 \u2192\u221e while scaling t1,2 7\u2192 t1,2/m21,2, we obtain the factorization\nZk1,k2,k3(\u03c31, \u03c32, \u03c33) ( t1 m1,2 )k1 ( t2 m1,2 )k2 tk33 \u2192 Zk1(\u03c31)Zk2,k3(\u03c32, \u03c33)t k1 1 t k2 2 t k3 3\nAgain, under any factorization, the LHS of (6.1) vanishes.\nNoting the symmetry \"1\u2194 3\", we list in the Appendix E the first several equations and their solutions, which are the same as those obtained by instanton counting as in B. Indeed the calculations are analogous to the ones already presented for the quiver with two nodes.\n\u2013 35 \u2013"

But now we are done since we can reduce the general case of more than n distinct exponents to this one by multilinearity.\nB Instanton counting\nHere we review the Nekrasov partition function of interest for this work [51, 52].

In the general \u2126-background, the equality (B.7) is not true. Nevertheless, the full sum (B.6) seems to be true universally, although this follows from more complicated cancellations. In any case, we are interested only in the self-dual case 1 = 1, 2 = \u22121. With that in mind, we write\nZbifund.(\u03c3,\u2212\u03c3, Y1, Y2, \u03c3,\u2212\u03c3,W1,W2, 0) = 2\u220f i=1 \u220f c\u2208Yi \u03be((\u22121)1\u2212i2\u03c3, Yi,W1\u2212i, c) \u220f c\u2208Wi ( \u2212\u03be((\u22121)1\u2212i2\u03c3,Wi, Y1\u2212i, c) ) 2\u220f i=1 \u220f c\u2208Yi \u03be(0, Yi,Wi, c) \u220f c\u2208Wi (\u2212\u03be(0,Wi, Yi, c))\n\u2013 39 \u2013\nWe prove the last line vanishes unless the Young diagrams are equal as Y1 = W1, Y2 = W2. Focusing on just one factor,\n\u03be(0, Y,W, c) = leg(c, Y ) + arm(c,W ) + 1\nconsider row diagrams Y = (1l1) and W = (1l2) with l1 6= l\u03032. WLOG, assume l1 > l\u03032. In this case for c = (l1, 1) we have\nleg(c, Y ) = (1l1)t1 \u2212 l1 = l1 \u2212 l1 = 0 arm(c,W ) = 0\u2212 1 = \u22121\n} \u21d2 \u03be(0, Y,W, c) = 0\u2212 1 + 1 = 0\nHowever, adding any amount of rows to any of the diagrams after the j = 1 one doesn\u2019t change this calculation. The other case is l1 = l\u03032. Then, for the same cell, arm(c,W ) = 1\u22121 = 0, and \u03be(0, Y,W, c) 6= 0. In fact, both the arm and the leg lengths have to be positive indefinite, since the cell c is contained within the diagrams Y and W , so \u03be(0, Y,W, c) 6= 0 for the whole row, i.e. i \u2208 [1, l1], j = 1. Next, we add rows to both diagrams, and we are in the same situation as before. If the rows are of equal length, the cell will be contained in both diagrams and the relative hook length will never vanish. Otherwise, if the j\u2019th row is the first one of unequal length, with lengths l1 > l\u03032, say, then the relative hook length of the cell c = (l1, j) vanishes by an analogous calculation. If all rows are equal, the diagrams are obviously the same, and there is no vanishing factor. Along with the trivial equality\nZbifund.(\u03c3,\u2212\u03c3, Y1, Y2, \u03c3,\u2212\u03c3, Y1, Y2, 0) = Zadj.(\u03c3,\u2212\u03c3, Y1, Y2)\nthis proves our claim.\nB.4 Universal one instanton formula\nIt was found in [55] that an instanton of topological charge 1 may be constructed by means of an sl2 triple corresponding to a long root. This was used to calculate the 1-instanton corrections to the Seiberg-Witten curve [56]. Besides this embedding in the internal degrees of freedom, the instanton has a C2 of moduli specifying its position, therefore the holomorphic functions on this product space is a U(1) 1 \u00d7U(1) 2 \u00d7W -module. It is precisely its character that the 5 dimensional uplift of the theory will be calculating, and the 4 dimensional formula may be seen as its \"Weyl dimension\" analogue, and in\n\u039b2h \u2228 Z1 = \u22121 1 2 \u2211 \u03b2 long\n1 ( 1 + 2 + \u03b2 \u00b7 a)(\u03b2 \u00b7 a) \u220f\n\u03b1\u00b7\u03b2\u2228=1 (\u03b1 \u00b7 a)\n7\u2192 \u2211 \u03b2 long\n1 (\u03b2 \u00b7 \u03c3)2 \u220f\n\u03b1\u00b7\u03b2\u2228=1 (\u03b1 \u00b7 \u03c3)\n(B.8)\nrewritten in -units [49]. Comparisons with ADHM calculations [48, 53, 57] tend to reveal some sign differences, e.g. ZBn,Cn1 |(B.8) = \u2212Z Bn,Cn 1 |ADHM, which is why the rescalable instanton counting factor of \u039b ought to be kept in mind.\n\u2013 40 \u2013\nB.5 Blowup equations\nThe instanton moduli spaces for exceptional groups lack an ADHM description since their fundamental representation is different from their defining one. Thus to compute higher instanton terms one cannot resort to the usual localisation techniques. An alternative approach, besides the one discussed in this paper, is by blowup equations, although these do not give compact expressions such as (B.8). Generalizing the 4d expression in [8] to general gauge groups as was done for 5d in [49], except noting that in 4d the partition function with flux on the exceptional divisor vanishes \u2013 so Z\u0302d=0 = Z but Z\u0302d\u22651 = 0 \u2013 we obtain\nZn( 1, 2,\u03c3) = 1\nn2 1 2 \u2211 1 2 m2+i1+i2=n\nm\u2208Q\u2228, i1,2<n\n( 1i1 + ( 1 + 2)i2 + m \u00b7 \u03c3 + 12m 2(2 1 + 2) )\nL( 1, 1 + 2,\u03c3,m)\n( 1i1 + ( 1 + 2)(i2 \u2212 n) + m \u00b7 \u03c3 + 1\n2 m2(2 1 + 2) ) Zi1( 1, 2,\u03c3 + 1m)Zi2(\u2212 2, 1 + 2,\u03c3 + ( 1 + 2)m) (B.9)\nstarting from Z0( 1, 2,\u03c3) = 1, where L( 1, 2,\u03c3,m) := \u220f \u03b1\u2208R `( 1, 2,\u03c3,m,\u03b1) and\n`( 1, 2,\u03c3,m,\u03b1) = \n\u220f i,j\u22650\ni+j\u2264\u2212m\u00b7\u03b1\u22121\n(\u2212i 1 \u2212 j 2 + m \u00b7 \u03c3), if m \u00b7\u03b1 < 0,\n\u220f i,j\u22650\ni+j\u2264m\u00b7\u03b1\u22122\n((i+ 1) 1 + (j + 1) 2 + m \u00b7 \u03c3), if m \u00b7\u03b1 > 1,\n1 otherwise.\n(B.10)\nSince we are interested in the self-dual background, we see that naively taking it leads to some singular terms in the summands due to the NS limit getting involved, so care must be taken to first preform the summation and then to take the limit. In particular, one can take 1 = 1 + \u03b4, 2 = \u22121 and then safely send \u03b4 \u2192 0 in the final expression."

Indeed, we find\u2211\ni\u22650 Z\n[D2] i (b1 \u2212 b2, b1 + b2,m)t i = e4t \u2211 i\u22650 Z [A1\u00d7A1] i (b1, b2,m)(\u22121) iti\nThis agrees with [58].\nD.2 D3 = A3\nParalleling the previous discussion, there is a linear isomorphism ofD3 and A3. Their extended root systems are the same, and from (3.3) for D3 we can obtain (4.5), (4.7) since\nD2(\u03c40) = \u2212t1/4\u03c42\u03c43 = D2(\u03c41)\nso the equations are likewise the same.\n\u2013 44 \u2013"
