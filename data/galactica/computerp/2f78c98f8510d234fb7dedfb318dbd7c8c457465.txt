conclusion and future works In this work, we introduce a novel framework that employs importance sampling within a Bayesian paradigm to minimize the human effort required in various daily scenarios that involve pHRI. We formalize how the robot can effectively infer task objectives (i.e., target pouring amount) and optimize the task skills (i.e., shaking, pouring, stopping) during the physical interaction. We show the analysis that how task goals can be inferred in complex daily manipulation tasks. We plan to conduct a user study to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in a series of complex pouring tasks involving shaking and tapping motions.
