            "text": "The Reader, established as a national charity since 2008, delivers Shared Reading groups across the United Kingdom and beyond, throughout diverse settings. The Reader\u2019s Theory of Change suggests that the reading aloud of classic literature, guided by a facilitator, promotes the recognition and articulation of thought and feeling, thereby positively effecting outcomes including well-being, connectedness, and cognitive and affective flexibility. The Shared Reading model encourages participants to develop an understanding of the self and others, and to connect and realise change with breakthroughs signalled by the transition in language i.e., linguistic traces differing from the norm (Davis et al., 2016). Such transitions may be important given that undeveloped language skills hinder the mastery of self-control (Beaver et al., 2008) and perspective-taking (Rawn and Vohs, 2006). This is congruous with the notion that reading for pleasure can induce the state of \u201cflow\u201d; the experience of this state requires both control and concentration (Towey, 2000). The state of flow has been described as an \u201cautotelic experience\u201d, in which the actor\u2019s attention is completely focussed on an activity and is not dependent on external goals or rewards (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975).\nIn terms of participant experience, Shared Reading aims to encourage balance, equity, and non-judgemental attitudes, and these aims may be a key component of Shared Reading\u2019s efficacy, particularly within highly constrained environments and clinical settings. Individuals using health care services sometimes report not having adequate time to talk about how they are feeling and feeling pressured to agree with psychiatrists (Taylor et al., 2007). This may lead to failure to attend aftercare and negative expectations for therapy following discharge.\nWell-managed Shared Reading sessions should provide an environment that allows patients/group members more time to consider and talk about how they are feeling than perhaps other creative interventions and provide a greater sense of continuity in the absence of an apparent \u201cauthority figure\u201d than psychological therapies. In contrast to many existing psychosocial interventions, Shared Reading does not necessitate the direct and explicit repetition of an individual\u2019s clinically relevant story which according to Hawton et al. (2011) can be perceived as unhelpful and distressing. Instead, Shared Reading tends to naturally elicit recollections of life beyond the rehearsed clinical narrative, uncovering and reviewing deeper, less emphasised episodes.\nThe discourse within Shared Reading group discussion prompted by literary material can be used to assess interactional skills and to indicate social psychological phenomena and self-development. Congruently, patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia experiencing negative behavioural signs (e.g., flat affect, alogia, anhedonia, and avolition; Chang et al., 2018) have shown a tendency to flout social knowledge shaping conversational conduct (Corcoran and Frith, 1996). Concerning\nrelevance, adjacency pairs have been considered the most basic conversational unit, a two-part exchange between two speakers that provides speakers with a frame of reference for conduct to achieve inter-subjectivity (Taguchi, 2019). Turntaking can take many forms, for example, greeting/greeting, information/acknowledgment, and accusation/denial (Qodriani and Wijana, 2021). It has been suggested that disrupted turn adjacency does not always lead to incoherent interaction although there have been limited suggestions as to how exactly coherence is maintained in such cases (Berglund, 2009).\nCo-construction of discourse can establish a sense of community. A discourse analysis of an online graduate course identified how patterns of agreement were linked to shared understanding and an enhanced sense of cohesion (Lapadat, 2007). Sophisticated social negotiations were found to allow disagreement whilst maintaining community which was achieved through allowing an opportunity to face-save, showing understanding, softening, and balancing. In addition, humour was used, participants invited comments, employed inclusive language, showed alignment with other participants, and used familiar genres. These findings indicate that growing social capital within groups allows communication of mutual benefit.\nFurthermore, discourse can drive behavioural change. Three dominant devices achieving mobilisation and public engagement were identified using a psychological discourse analysis of two Facebook event pages (Sneijder et al., 2018). Positive atmosphere and \u201ctogetherness\u201d were promoted through the use of positive language to undermine or attenuate negative event aspects while the use of the pronoun \u201cwe\u201d constructed collectivity. In accordance, the use of \u201cwe\u201d in discourse can be used to promote solidarity, shared authority (De Fina, 2003), and construct identity, for example, through indexing inclusivity and exclusivity (Selvi et al., 2021). Additionally, \u201cwe\u201d can also introduce ambiguity by hiding agency and has been employed for this purpose in controversial speech (Jalilifar and Alavi, 2011). Flexible use of \u201cwe\u201d can influence the power dynamic through, for example, the representation of professional and subgroup positions (Kvarnstr\u00f6m and Cedersund, 2006).\nSimilarly, the use of the singular first-person pronoun \u201cI\u201d can have a multitude of different rhetorical effects. An investigation of a corpus of congressional speeches reported that the functions included achieving self-focus, the exhibition of dominance, to express strong opinions, in turn, dismissing others\u2019 opinions, to show compassion, to express personal wishes, and to narrate a story (Lenard, 2016). In studies of power and political discourse, the use of \u201cI\u201d has been associated with declaring responsibility, strong conviction, and willingness to take risks.\nThe importance of discourse type and implicit alignment of language has been highlighted in the literature. In a discourse analysis of nine individuals\u2019 first psychotherapy\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nsessions, interlocutors most frequently adopted colloquial discourse, whereas the therapists mostly used therapeutic discourse (Wahlstr\u00f6m, 2018). It was reported that the common expressions used and shared by therapists and service users within the session allowed for intimate experiences to be explored from new perspectives, and the frequent use of colloquial discourse demonstrated how the person-to-person relationship was a primary function of sessions. In contrast, over-lexicalisation may have a redundant effect, and chaos of stories and events may result in confusion. The discomfort it generates has been linked to countertransference within therapy sessions (Castells, 2018).\nThe use of silence, the antithesis of over-lexicalisation, has been investigated as a tool (Ephratt, 2008, 2012; Nikolic\u0301, 2016) within both conflict management and psychotherapy. Chowdhury et al. (2017) suggested that silence can indicate hesitation or indecisiveness of the speaker and may be used to force another speaker to respond. Qualitative analyses examining therapist perceptions of the use of silence in therapy found silence was used to show empathy (also recognised as a communicative resource; Martinovski, 2006), facilitate reflection and expression, and encourage clients to take responsibility (Ladany et al., 2004). Furthermore, therapists perceived their use of silence to be positively associated with the experience of providing therapy. Therapists, however, reported that they did not tend to employ silence as a communicative strategy with individuals experiencing psychosis, anxiety, or anger. The appropriateness of employing silence and other rhetoric devices appears, therefore, to be client and activityspecific.\nThe use of therapeutic arts\u2013based therapies has received greater acceptance and recognition from health care professionals and the public in recent years, due to a growing body of evidence supporting outcomes such as enhanced social connection and awareness (National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health UK, 2014). This has led to investment in mental health research networks drawing together professionals from the sciences, humanities, and arts (Medical Research Council, 2018). Much of the research assessing Shared Reading within clinical populations has been conducted within community settings and with predominantly female samples. Shared Reading may be particularly beneficial within high-security psychiatric settings through its potential to improve the quality of interactions and thus level of connectedness.\nThe goal of this study was to uniquely investigate: (i) participants\u2019 use of discourse to accomplish social action across Shared Reading sessions, specifically employing psychological discourse analysis; (ii) to do so within the context of a high secure setting, both drawing on the existing literature and allowing the identification of new, perhaps context-specific pathways of interaction; and (iii) to employ a case series design to identify and differentiate stylistic tendencies and personcentred change over time."

Usually, both a story and a poem were read aloud and discussed within the session. A record of the material can be found inTable 1. Reading material was selected by the facilitator, and researcher from literary fiction resources recommended and provided by The Reader. Sessions were facilitated by an Associate Specialist in Forensic Psychiatry [KN] who is a trained Shared Reading group leader and the researcher [MW] who also completed a Read to Lead course provided by The Reader and attended all sessions.\nSessions took place in a therapy suite within Ashworth Hospital and the researcher audio and video recorded all sessions. Participants were invited to a taster session prior to study commencement to help participants decide whether they wished to participate and informed consent was sought prior to starting the study.\nThe data sources comprised 39 videos and audio-recorded Shared Reading group sessions (approximately 55 h of discourse). The data to be analysed were selected, generating the corpus; salient sessions were selected by the researcher, in agreement with the facilitator and wider research team. Sessions that were considered salient best addressed the research goals and were attended by regular participants allowing change to be observed over time. Transcription, utilising both audio and video recordings, was performed by the researcher to allow full immersion and to respect the sensitivity of the data. All files were accessed and stored using the researcher\u2019s password-protected Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust or University of Liverpool account, and participant responses were pseudo-anonymised."

The analysis procedure was, in keeping with methodological recommendations, focussing\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\non how discursive and rhetoric devices are implemented to accomplish social actions. As advocated by Willig (2001), the researcher also adopted a critical stance and demonstrated awareness of the social context. The epistemological foundations of discourse analysis are within social constructionism rather than positivism which is concerned with uncovering the true nature of actions (Johnstone, 2002). Appropriate research questions were generated that were in keeping with ensuing analysis and discursive theory. The focus was on how participants interacted with the reading material and group members and did not centralise around speakers\u2019 thought processes or attitudes toward a topic of discussion.\nA \u201csimplified Jeffersonian\u201d (Goodman, 2017) level of transcription was undertaken for reader accessibility. Transcription contained sufficient but not unnecessary detail to address the research questions. Body language and\npauses were noted when affecting the meaning of discourse. Transcripts were line numbered for clarity and ease of referral. A preliminary rereading of transcripts was undertaken for data familiarity. Action orientation, i.e., what was being achieved by interaction and initial thoughts were recorded through marking and annotation of transcripts. Drawing on the vast literature, discursive and rhetoric devices used within discourse were identified, for example, use of language of certainty, endorsement seeking, turn-taking, and strategies for disagreement. The use of repertoires, ideological dilemmas, and how subject positions and identity were constructed by the speakers was examined. Devices were recorded through marginal writing on transcripts. Strategies that best addressed the research questions were selected, and extracts and examples were collated in a word document. The extracts were described to illustrate cases for each participant.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org"

Over the course of that year, the attrition rate was 60% leaving four regular participants upon whom this case analysis is based. Two other participants attended 23 and 5% of the sessions before withdrawing. The case studies present discourse archetypes and participants represented a complex forensic sample; all participants had experienced psychosis, had a history of self-harm, and most had been in the prison system. Participants referenced troubled childhoods, problems at school, and were involved in crime from an early age. These particular men had less of a problem with substance use than the general clinical/forensic population but all of them had experienced it at some point. None had the experience of full employment, two participants regarded themselves as readers prior to the study, two did not, and two participants experienced neurocognitive impairments that impacted their ability to concentrate. The participants shared similar demographic characteristics such as age (M = 45.25, SD = 6.45) and ethnicity, all were White British. Each of the four participants attended over sixty percent of sessions, and reasons for occasional non-attendance of regular participants were mostly attributable to physical illness or other appointments. Discontinuation of two participants beyond the 25th session was due to external, non-study-related factors such as service transfer and/or logistical issues."

            "text": "Pseudonyms are employed for the following cases.\nParticipant one\u2014Clive: A broadening of capacity to consider alternative interpretations of events\nClive attended 24 out of 39 study sessions and was present for eight out of ten sessions forming the corpus for analysis. The participant did not generally require encouragement to speak, took more turns than other speakers, and his contribution was generally descriptive. Clive\u2019s discourse demonstrated a broadening of capacity to consider different interpretations across sessions and over time. This change was demonstrable both in response to the text and in response to the opinions of other group members to some degree. Particular discursive devices, the change in use and culmination was identified as illustrating this enhanced capacity. These were predominantly the use of certainty and declarative language, consensus, polysyndeton (the use of successive conjunctions), appeals to the listener, and posing of substantive questions.\nClive\u2019s discourse in the first few sessions was characterised by expressions of high certainty and commitment to his initial interpretations. This was evident in Clive\u2019s discourse around the characters\u2019 thoughts, feelings, and actions. For example, \u201cshe\u2019s got to. . .\u201d and \u201cerm that\u2019s still er that\u2019s still basically the same\u201d (session one p. 29 line 13 and p. 44 line 28), \u201che must be thinking. . .\u201d (session two p. 18 line 21), \u201cthat\u2019s the way it should be\u201d (session three p. 17 line 16), and \u201cI think she\u2019s doing what I said before. . . she feels reborn again\u201d (session four p. 59 line 15).\nOver time, there was a move to greater use of hedging phrases and words associated with less certainty; \u201cit means to have I think it means to have like erm. . .\u201d (session five p.12 line 38), \u201cso I think looking at that only by my own experience. . .\u201d and \u201ccould be loads of different things\u201d (session five p. 18 line 22). Clive\u2019s use of hedges served to show his improved consideration of different points of view and seemed to convey a degree of humility by reducing the force of his statements. At six months into the intervention, Clive showed some recognition of this; \u201cI think so anyway probably just prove me wrong as we get further along that\u2019s the way these stories are\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind now about that. . .\u201d (session six p. 6 line 2 and p. 42 line 13). Furthermore, Clive displayed some self-corrective language in session eight (p. 16 line 26); \u201cso it\u2019s the be- it might be the beginning of a little affair mighten it because you\u2019ll alwaprobably say that may happen or you might. . ..\u201d\nToward the start of the intervention, Clive\u2019s discourse was characterised by the use of first-person plural pronouns which appeared to act as an indicator of general agreement and in doing so reinforced the speaker\u2019s own interpretation. An example of this use of \u201cwe,\u201d its pairing with the intensifier \u201call\u201d (a quantifier used for emphasis), \u201courselves,\u201d and the use of \u201cwe\u201d within a rhetorical tag question was evident within the discussion of A Selection from Three Songs at the End of Summer by Jane Kenyon, session one (p. 4 line 15): \u201cand I think I think we\u2019ve all stood under a tree and to protect ourselves from rain and she can feel that rain dripping down off from the tree so her stepping out in the rain. . .\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re talking about a pretty big nest here aren\u2019t we.\u201d\nClive\u2019s use of polysyndeton, specifically the successive use of \u201cand,\u201d elongated the discourse. The use of the transition \u201cso\u201d further focussed the attention of the listener, before drawing a conclusion. Whilst \u201cI think\u201d can serve as a hedge, contextually, given its repetition, coexisting devices, and syntactic placement as a preface, the effect in this study may be rather factive accomplishing emphasis. Toward the end of session two, as shown in the transcript excerpt in Figure 1, the use of \u201cwe\u201d and \u201call of us\u201d was initially used to speak on behalf of the group when Clive conveyed his difficulty in interpreting the material. However, this was not sustained throughout the utterance given the adoption of the second-person plural \u201cyou\u201d paired with the modal verb \u201cwould.\u201d This granted genericity and attenuated agency. This was followed by an explicit acknowledgment that members of the group had different opinions. In contrast to the\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nFacilitator: Yeah we got through it, I like that poem though, do you like the poem? John: Yeah Facilitator: Was it okay? Clive: We struggled to understand it though if we didn\u2019t have all of us\nhere and you were reading it on our own, I think you\u2019d come to the wrong conclusion about the whole thing and you wouldn\u2019t have the diversity of the people that are here because everyone\u2019s had their own opinions kind of thing\nFIGURE 1 Session two extract (p. 45 line 17).\nFacilitator: How do you feel, how you all feeling?\nMax: Alright\nFacilitator: Have you got things to do, cheer- to think about when you get back? (Patrick laughs)\nJohn: Yeah\nFacilitator: Yeah take your mind off it a bit\nClive: It\u2019s been a bit exhausting today to be honest, I don\u2019t know why\nFacilitator: Because we\u2019ve talked about some [difficult] things\nMax: Been a bit what?\nClive: Exhausting but some of us have like John\u2019s done it, I\u2019ve done it, you (gesturing to Patrick) have done it as well lad\nFIGURE 2 Session six extract (p. 44 line 5).\nsession one example, \u201cI think\u201d increased in hedging function, embedded within the utterance. The complement \u201cbecause\u201d whilst drawing a conclusion had a less exertive force when followed by the terminal tag and hedging phrase, \u201ckind of thing\u201d ascribing less certainty.\nThe facilitator, acknowledging sensitive discussion within session six, as shown in Figure 2, proceeded to \u201ccheck in\u201d with participants as part of a debrief before participants returned to the ward. Patrick laughed in response to the facilitator\u2019s question, \u201cHave you got things to do, cheer- to think about when you get back?\u201d Whilst laughter perhaps served to indicate amusement at the false start and anticipated understatement (cheer you up), on another level, it functioned to terminate talk acting as a turn rejection. John and Max\u2019s single-word neutral responses, \u201cyeah\u201d and \u201calright,\u201d respectively, did not require expansion and functioned to push the interaction forward. In contrast, Clive conveyed, although with referential ambiguity, that reflection and disclosure within the session had been cognitively demanding.\nClive\u2019s use of the adjective \u201cexhausting\u201d was accompanied by a hedge and honest statement to convey a personal rather\nthan communal record in addition to the anticipatory selfidentifying and face-saving expression, \u201cI don\u2019t know why.\u201d Upon Max seeking clarification, Clive expanded not through the use of inclusive first-person plural pronouns but using address terms, the singular first-person pronoun \u201cI\u201d and the singular second-person pronoun \u201cyou,\u201d forming a three-part list to augment the idea and separate agency. The approximation and hedge \u201csome of us have like\u201d paired with the ambiguous verb construction \u201cdone it\u201d (i.e., spoken about difficult things), and the informal terms of address, \u201clad,\u201d softened the discourse and served to portray a group of individuals with social actions in common, as opposed to signalling a single body all with the same experience. In this way, Clive established a form of collectivity as opposed to his prior tendency to prematurely proclaim an established consensus.\nOver the duration of the intervention, Clive\u2019s discourse demonstrated a shift in framing from the tendency to be speaker focussed to more listener-focussed. For example, in session one, the use of cajolers such as \u201ccan I just say something\u201d (p. 34 line 26) and \u201cyou know\u201d served as appeals to the listener and turn-entry devices allowed structuring of the conversation; \u201cyou know what, that\u2019s where man- a lot of people don\u2019t know thisthat\u2019s where man actually learnt to sing\u201d (p. 5 line 29). The modal \u201cactually\u201d conveyed information about the attitude of the speaker with regards to the message, communicating the speaker\u2019s view of the utterance\u2019s unexpected content, novelty, and certainty about the surprising content. This was reinforced by the aside \u201ca lot of people don\u2019t know this\u201d which has an interactive function, relating the topic to an everyday frame and marking the digression, whilst Clive also established himself as a source of superior knowledge in the group. In session three, Clive continued to convey his own interpretation of the text with appeals to the listener such as \u201cisn\u2019t he. . .you can tell. . .,\u201d however, the use of an option marker \u201cor\u201d also showed consideration for another speaker\u2019s turn; \u201che\u2019s wishing he\u2019s wishing isn\u2019t he that you can tell by because he mentions death so much I think he\u2019s scared of actually dying not just a youngman\u2019s death but he\u2019s scared of dying in general or like you said he wants to be able to have that opportunity to be able to do the things that he might never of done just faded into the night kind of thing. . .\u201d (p. 7 line 14).\nClive\u2019s discourse in session four demonstrated further alignment and recognition of another speaker\u2019s turn, the use of \u201cwell\u201d demonstrated receipt of information whilst \u201cI mean\u201d promoted speaker clarification; \u201cwell yeah you\u2019re right you\u2019re bang on the button there [Facilitator]. . .\u2018cause I can remember. . . I couldn\u2019t cope I mean absolute- I was my most depressed. . .\u201d (p. 63 line 9). The frequent use of the singular first person \u201cI\u201d contributed to the reflective stance and heightened self-involvement through conveying individualised, personal experience. The tendency for listener-focussed speech in later sessions was evidenced by Clive\u2019s use of substantive questions.

            "heading": "Participant two\u2014Patrick: Increased assertiveness",
            "text": "Patrick attended 25 out of 39 study sessions and was present for seven out of ten sessions forming the corpus for analysis. Patrick\u2019s discourse displayed increased selfconfidence and assertiveness across sessions, which could be evidenced through changes in generalisation, voicing disagreement in the interpretation of the text, endorsement seeking, and use of humour.\nPatrick\u2019s discourse up until five months into the intervention showed a tendency to employ plural secondperson pronouns, conveying personal experience and opinion through generalisations about how people feel without a clearly identifiable referent. In session one, the facilitator posed the question, \u201cwhat was it like waiting to go on that first day [of school]?\u201d (p. 32 line 7), to which Patrick responded, \u201cit\u2019s like you\u2019ve got no choice\u201d (p. 32 line 9). Similarly, ambiguity of agency was achieved through discourse such as \u201cwhen you\u2019re a kid all your life\u2019s like on rails isn\u2019t it\u201d (session one p. 41 line 31) and \u201cfor a lot of people in here it\u2019s a bit depressing\u201d (session\nfour p. 55 line 24). At five months into the intervention, a story called The Loss by David Constantine was read, in which the character Mr. Silverman loses his soul. Patrick\u2019s use of self-reference uniquely and unambiguously conveyed access to the speaker, using more first-person singular pronouns. For example, \u201cI think I was there at one point many years ago I was like that at one point. . . no joy . . . feelings nothing\u201d (session five p. 30 line 39). In session eight, as shown by the extract in Figure 4, the agency behind the generic \u201cyou learn\u201d was revealed when Patrick drew on personal experience when prompted, expanding his turn with the use of \u201cI.\u201d \u201cI\u201d as the subject of verbs portrayed a truthful narrator and increased level of ownership over discourse albeit then attenuated with the use of the hedge \u201cmaybe\u201d.\nPatrick\u2019s discourse was initially characterised by questions and hesitant tonality, \u201c[Researcher]. . . is it in America?\u201d (session one p. 21 line 8), \u201care they old people?\u201d (session three p. 17 line 3), \u201cis he actually thinking them thoughts now the dog?\u201d (session four p. 6 line 30), and \u201cdo you think she\u2019s found someone to love?\u201d (session four p. 61 line 20). Posing utterances as questions accomplished conveying personal interpretation in an unassertive, unchallenging manner. Uncertain language and use of tag questions contributed to this effect; for example, \u201che wants to die young but he doesn\u2019t if you understand what I mean\u201d (session three p. 7 line 8). The contrastive marker \u201cbut\u201d adds lexical ambiguity and contradiction whilst the tag question \u201cif you understand what I mean\u201d relied on metaknowledge of the listener and served to seek endorsement. In later sessions, Patrick communicated interpretation through more declarative utterances.\nDisagreement with other speakers was managed diplomatically with the use of hedging; for example, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s. . . a bird as such\u201d (session seven p. 69 line 5), \u201cI think he it\u2019s not necessarily what country I think it depends on the person as a person\u201d (session seven p. 38 line 17), and \u201cfeels worthless as well because she\u2019s got nothing to do. . .\u201d (session eight p. 30 line 9). The extract from session eight, as shown in Figure 5, provided a further example of how Patrick more assertively expressed opinion and feeling; \u201cyeah\u201d\nFacilitator: I think- why do you think there\u2019s a difference between the description between the feeling of pleasure and feeling of sorrow (Max shakes head)\nPatrick: Because you learn to be humble when you\u2019re sorrowful is that not true?\nFacilitator: Is that is that what you think?\nJohn: Excuse me (not part of adjacency pair)\nPatrick: I\u2019d say that over the last like twenty years since I committed my index offense (Max looks at John) <I have learnt> to be sorrowful (slight shrug) maybe\nFIGURE 4 Session eight extract (p. 40 line 3).\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nClive: So she\u2019s been chatting for a mile and er chatting for another mile she didn\u2019t chat at all\nPatrick: Yeah but she learned more from sorrow you learn more from sorrow\nFacilitator: Yeah\nResearcher: But what type of things can you learn from sorrow\nClive: Sadness\nPatrick: Regret\u2026 remorse\nFIGURE 5 Session eight extract (p. 41 line 13).\nserved to acknowledge the previous turn whilst the contrastive marker acted as a rejecter and successive repetition of Patrick\u2019s utterance reinforced the speaker\u2019s message. Patrick proceeded to demonstrate the development of the emotional lexicon, describing how you can learn \u201cregret\u201d (and then deeper), \u201cremorse\u201d from sorrow.\nAdditionally, Patrick\u2019s use of humour and portrayal of characters in initial sessions generally drew parallels with the experience of psychosis, serving a somewhat self-depreciative function; for example, \u201cI think they\u2019d have something to say if we go off on adventures here\u201d (session three p. 39 line 26) and \u201che\u2019ll end up in here won\u2019t he\u201d (session four p. 23 line 23). In session eight, upon the researcher drawing attention to word selection within the poem Along the Road by Robert Browning Hamilton, \u201cit\u2019s interesting how the word chattered was picked. . . why chattered\u201d (p. 45 line 30), Patrick responded through an impersonation of the imagined character, \u201ca word for rambling (p. 46 line 6). . .oh this is great this is good this is brilliant (laughs).\u201d In contrast to previous humour, the discourse was not negatively inflected and demonstrated the embodiment of the character rather than a comparison to personal circumstances. The shift in positioning suggests heightened absorption in the material and was accompanied by a notably animated tone, which emerged concomitantly with decreased hesitancy.\nIn summary, over the sessions, Patrick developed discursive strategies to increase the level of ownership of his discourse; his emotions and thoughts became public. Patrick showed greater confidence in expressing his own opinion and interpretation of the reading material. Indeed, the Theory of Change describes how both the reading material and facilitator can enhance the articulation of thought and feeling. This in turn led to greater assertiveness, a key social skill and diminished fear of threat to the self from exposing feelings and the self."

The extent to which communicative strategies served self-presentation and monitoring functions attenuated moderately over time. The quantity and turn-taking frequency of John\u2019s discourse varied considerably between sessions but generally increased.\nJohn\u2019s discourse in the first six months was particularly marked by repetition and paraphrasing of other speaker\u2019s turns, with a tendency to follow and align, particularly with Clive; \u201clike Clive says. . . Clive what were you going to say\u201d (session one p. 30 line 26) and \u201cagree with you Clive good stuff\u201d (session five p. 27 line 46). Similarly, in session two, as shown in Figure 6, John repeated the idea that a character in the story Penny in the Dust by Ernest Buckler was embarrassed upon losing a special penny from his father. John\u2019s use of \u201cso\u201d and \u201cbecause\u201d continued to reiterate and reinforce an established idea with the use of \u201cyeah\u201d also serving to align with Clive. Subordinate responses within adjacency pairs, through the repetition of established ideas, functioned to avoid expansion and disagreement. The use of non-committal language also served to avoid expressing a personal opinion, for example, in session three following the facilitator\u2019s question, \u201cdo you think they go together the poem and the story?\u201d (p. 37 line 3), John responded, \u201cmight do.\u201d This tendency was to some extent acknowledged by John in session ten (p. 24 line 6); \u201cwhen I don\u2019t make comments it\u2019s because I don\u2019t understand it properly. . .today I\u2019ve understood quite well. . .when I know what I\u2019m doing when I\u2019m working it out that\u2019s when I comment a lot. . .because I understand it and I understand what it says and what it\u2019s about.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s discourse also reflected positive self-portrayal; \u201cI remember I remember everything from the age of two\u201d (session one p. 3 line 16), \u201cI went to the dentist this morning and [they] said I had a good set of strong teeth\u201d (session three p. 19 line 5), and \u201cand like I say I\u2019ve been here six years I\u2019ve done some therapies and I must have benefitted off them because I\u2019ve not self-harmed\u201d (session four p. 47 line 18). When discussing the number of sessions completed in session five,\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nJohn enquired as to whether attendance was recorded on the medical record system, \u201cis it on PACIS is it on PACIS?\u201d (p. 52 line 45). Monitoring self-presentation was also accomplished within discussion through John\u2019s use of disclaimers, such as \u201cI don\u2019t hear voices no more you know but. . . it\u2019s been right as rain\u201d (session six p. 32 line 22) and \u201clike I said everybody\u2019s got a good side and a bad side haven\u2019t they like I\u2019ve never lashed out at anybody since I\u2019ve been here you know \u2018cause I\u2019m not a bad person you know what I mean. . .\u201d (session seven p. 52 line 5).\nJohn went on to explicitly acknowledge concern with selfimage, \u201cI was scared I was worried about what people thought of me personally I use to to er worry about what people would think of me. . .I do think because I\u2019ve been in the nut house. . .\u201d (session seven p. 56 line 16). John\u2019s attitude was strongly conveyed by the use of derogatory epithets.\nJohn employed topic change to accomplish avoidance which appeared to be a sophisticated strategy for managing the direction of the conversation, albeit potentially maladaptive in the context of therapeutic encounters. For example, whilst John disclosed the death of a relative following the misinterpretation of the previous speaker\u2019s prompt, John proceeded to reject empathy and prevent expansion through talk termination, \u201ctime for a drink I think time for a break\u201d (session six p. 23 line 25). Non-alignment in footing (i.e., speaker selection and changing of context) during an interaction with Max was also used to avoid voicing a demanded response, shown in Figure 7.\nFooting placed the speaker in the least self-threatening position, accomplishing to nullify and disengage from Max\u2019s notion that taking prescription drugs for non-prescriptive purposes was not too dissimilar from the \u201cdruggy\u201d behaviour John disaffiliated from, \u201cI\u2019ve never been a druggy\u201d (session seven p. 36 line 20). An interlocutor seeking clarification\nfor a question they do not understand and providing an irrelevant response seems to be an evasive strategy. However, John continues to question the question posed and responded by changing the textual content, following the receipt \u201cha\u201d and rejection, \u201cno.\u201d The interpretation in which the speaker avoids discourse that is dis-concordant with positive selfrepresentation is, in this instance, more in keeping contextually with the surrounding discourse than interpreting the exchange as merely a misunderstanding. Similarly, in session ten, when the facilitator remarked upon the discussion of familial trust, \u201cbut does that mean that people would automatically trust?\u201d (p. 47 line 24), John responded, \u201cI would like them to trust me yeah \u2018cause I\u2019m their father\u201d (p. 47 line 25). John did not align with the facilitator\u2019s positioning as indicated by the contrastive marker \u201cbut\u201d and used the modal verb \u201cwould\u201d and \u201cyeah\u201d to acknowledge the previous turn and topic shift, achieving a degree of evasion. Whilst the maxim of relation, one of Grice\u2019s (1975) four maxims forming the cooperative principle remained somewhat violated in this example, the speaker did not employ complete avoidance strategies or ambiguous language.\nThe novelty of the speaker\u2019s turn contrasts the imitation and alignment devices that exemplified earlier sessions. In summary, over the sessions, John\u2019s interaction style became less characterised by the tendency to follow within an adjacency pair and the extent to which discursive devices monitored selfpresentation reduced to some degree. Change in avoidance strategies may indicate a greater openness to other experiences, which the Theory of Change describes as \u201cbreaking through.\u201d"

            "heading": "Participant four\u2014Max: Heightened engagement",
            "text": "Max attended 30 out of 39 study sessions and was present for nine out of ten sessions forming the corpus for analysis. Changes within adjacency pairs, strategies for disagreement, non-verbal behaviour, and disclosure served the purpose of heightening social interaction and engagement over time. Generally, Max\u2019s discourse reflected literary knowledge. Max was often able to add to the group\u2019s understanding of settings within the material read and biographical information about authors.\nIn session two, the facilitator provided introductions upon Max starting the intervention. Following greetings from both the researcher and Clive, the facilitator enquired, \u201c[Researcher] comes from the university like I explained and do you know Clive?\u201d (p. 1 line 23) to which Max responded, \u201cWho\u2019s Clive?\u201d (p. 1 line 25). Max\u2019s utterance did not attend to cues provided by previous adjacency pairs. In addition, verbal acknowledgment of the other speaker\u2019s actions or presence was absent resulting in abruptness of turn. Similarly, when the researcher asked, \u201cdo you think his dad might be upset that his son thought [that]\u201d (session two p. 22 line 1), Max provided a non-sequitur, boundary-challenging response, \u201cAre you from London?\u201d (p.\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nPatrick: Yeah I\u2019ve found that as I\u2019m getting older the young ones take the piss a little bit\nClive: Mmm\nPatrick: As you get a bit older yeah\nFacilitator: And what\u2019s that like\nPatrick: Alright just (shrugs)\nClive: Just laugh at it don\u2019t you\nMax: Got to get on with it haven\u2019t you just got to get on with it\nClive: Yeah you\u2019re right Max\nFIGURE 8 Session six extract (p. 29 line 12).\n22 line 4) which may also reflect distraction from the session. The dis-preferred nature of discourse was emphasised by interactional differences in framing.\nA later instance in this session demonstrated Max employing functionally related adjacency pairs but in doing so Max dismissed other group members\u2019 interpretation of the material, \u201cyou aren\u2019t going to have six girlfriends are you?\u201d (p. 31 line 27). In contrast, Max used a different discourse style for managing disagreement within a discussion about the effects of money toward the end of the intervention. When John suggested, \u201ctoo much money goes to people\u2019s heads,\u201d Max responded, \u201cdon\u2019t think she\u2019s one of them though she\u2019s erm she\u2019s quite (looking to facilitator) is it corpus mentis [sic]?\u201d (session nine p. 35 line 27). The hedge phrases \u201cdon\u2019t think, quite,\u201d the contrastive \u201cthough\u201d and hesitator \u201cerm,\u201d served to tentatively soften the rejection. In addition, the aiding of group inter-subjectivity in the latter sessions was more collaborative in style; Max was more interactionally responsive to group members; \u201cyeah he is he\u2019s a poet and an author\u201d (session seven p. 52 line 20) and conveyed access to other speakers\u2019 mental states through empathic turns. For example, in session six, as shown in Figure 8, Max acknowledged previous turns discussing ward dynamics and aligned with Patrick and Clive\u2019s non-verbal and verbal behaviour. Continuation of sentiment and experience could be identified through the endorsementseeking tag question, \u201chaven\u2019t you,\u201d recurrent employment of \u201cjust\u201d mirroring previous turns and Max\u2019s successive repetition of \u201cgot to get on with it\u201d which produced an amplifying effect.\nAt this six-month point, the use of adjacency pairs served to promote collegiality. Max\u2019s language showed a change in attitude, particularly toward poetry, across the intervention. In session two, negative sentiment was expressed through negation, \u201c[got to be honest with you] I\u2019m not really one for. . .poems don\u2019t really [get] reading them\u201d (session two p. 30 line 14). This contrasted the engagement within session eight, \u201cso it\u2019s totally opposite to the first paragraph isn\u2019t it\u201d (p. 39 line 27) and \u201cI tell you. . . it\u2019s a way of explaining how he feels\u201d (session seven p. 69 line 6). The use of \u201cso\u201d serves to indicate Max drawing a conclusion with the use of the intensifier \u201ctotally\u201d resulting in\nClive: Sorry Max Max (Max finding place)\nFacilitator: Have you got it Max\nMax: Yeah\nClive: 162 on the left hand side at the top\nFacilitator: Take mine\nFIGURE 9 Session seven extract (p. 10 line 2).\na more animated style of discourse. The use of cajolers such as \u201cI tell you\u201d also served to indicate more listener-focussed interaction. Furthermore, positivity was expressed explicitly, \u201cI actually like that one\u201d (session seven p. 71 line 8) and \u201cit was a pleasure today I enjoyed it\u201d (session eight p. 49 line 5).\nThroughout the intervention, Max demonstrated an increasing effort to reengage with material and interaction when concentration or engagement lapsed. For example, session four was marked by body language indicating disengagement and distraction such as nail biting (p. 34 line 4), moving the chair back (p. 70 line 11), and fidgeting (p. 63 line 17). Whilst Max remarked, \u201cI\u2019m tired\u201d in session five (p. 3 line 4) this was followed by Max sitting up, making a concerted effort to re-focus. Accordingly, this was mirrored within verbal communication, \u201ccan we get a drink in a minute can we get a drink in a minute. . . what\u2019s that. . . what\u2019s that (session five p. 25 line 17).\u201d Max\u2019s frustration at losing his place during reading of the material was recognised by other group members and evident in an extract from session seven, shown in Figure 9.\nChange in disclosure and expression of feeling was observed in Max\u2019s discourse. Following disclosure of the loss of relatives at a young age in session three, the discourse was marked by a long weighted pause marking both listener empathy and speechlessness. Disclosure appeared more like a revelation prompted by the poem as opposed to routine or confessional. John\u2019s starter \u201cwell\u201d (p. 11 line 28) remained an incomplete phrase whilst Clive communicated empathy more explicitly, \u201cToo early that isn\u2019t it too early they sa-\u201d (p. 11 line 29). Talk was terminated by Max\u2019s response, \u201cwell having said that it was so long ago I was so young I didn\u2019t really know what was going on\u201d (p. 11 line 30). The use of \u201cwell\u201d functions to preface a topic shift, marks an insufficient response (i.e., not the response intended by the previous turn), it rejects empathy given and in doing so avoids expansion.\nLike the literature itself, the participants\u2019 discourse was full of spaces for inference, potential resonance, and other unspoken words. However, Max did expand description of negative experiences in later sessions; \u201cI\u2019ve been like that as well. . . when I was in The Scrubs I wouldn\u2019t say I was dirty. . . but er I didn\u2019t wash myself I didn\u2019t care about myself I didn\u2019t eat\u201d (session five p. 31 line 1). Upon reading, Two Gentle People by Graham Greene, the group discussed the nature of communication\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\nthat you may have with a stranger. Max\u2019s discourse explicitly communicated discomfort with conveying feelings, heightened through hesitation and endorsement-seeking appeals to the listener, \u201cI don\u2019t like that me I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m quite on my own if you know what I mean I don\u2019t really express my feelings you know what I mean (session eight p. 12 line 26).\u201d\nSimilarly, in session nine, participants discussed what they would do with a million pounds, to which Max responded, \u201cdo you know what I\u2019d do. . . I want to build my own prison . . . because I\u2019d feel safe\u201d (p. 29 line 24). In light of this discourse, prior avoidance of expression and disclosure of feelings may have been used as a self-protective communicative strategy. This emphasised the poignancy of Max\u2019s discourse in session ten; \u201cI\u2019ve felt guilty sometimes you know . . . I shouldn\u2019t really say this but I will. . . the things is with me like I\u2019m always placing all [my] trust in the relationship you know what I mean\u201d (session ten p. 37 line 31). The frequent use of the singular first-person pronoun \u201cI\u201d accomplished heightened reflection, ownership of feeling and mental autonomy, although cautiously with the employment of the disclaimer \u201cI shouldn\u2019t really say this\u201d and two appeals for listener endorsement, \u201cyou know.\u201d Nevertheless, this contrasted the briskness of turns within initial sessions.\nIn summary, Max developed strategies for managing disagreement and showed an increased tendency to re-focus following concentration failure. Growth within the Theory of Change links increased attention and openness, which is in keeping with Max\u2019s willingness to disclose feelings. These discursive strategies showed Max\u2019s heightened engagement over the duration of sessions."

            "text": "Archetypes of interactional achievement across Shared Reading sessions were presented through psychological discourse analysis. Certain rhetorical strategies were identified and their effects were characteristic of, but, importantly, not exclusive to, certain individuals and build upon both the discursive and non-discursive existing literature.\nBroadening of capacity to consider different interpretations across sessions was illustrated through Clive. The function of first-person personal pronouns transitioned from predominantly establishing consensus through speaking on behalf of the group to promoting collegiality. This is reflective of research finding that the flexible use of \u201cwe\u201d creates a power dynamic in the representation of subgroups (Kvarnstr\u00f6m and Cedersund, 2006) and can function to construct collectivity (Sneijder et al., 2018). There was evidence for discourse shifting from speaker to listener-focussed; initial discourse, characterised by appeals to the listener and polysyndeton, contrasted with later use of non-directive substantive questions. This is in keeping with Lapadat\u2019s (2007) finding that posing questions can promote coherence and be forward structuring.\nHowever, the current study\u2019s findings suggest this effect may not be achieved if the language of substantive questions is directive and knowledge-testing as opposed to knowledge-seeking. Over the duration of the intervention, Clive\u2019s discourse also showed a heightened propensity to utilise hedging, ascribing less certainty to claims.\nAn increase in assertiveness across sessions was identified through Patrick\u2019s discourse. This was partly achieved by the movement from second-person plural pronouns to singular first-person pronouns to convey experience. This supports \u201cI\u201d functioning to narrate a personal story (Lenard, 2016) and contrasts the use of \u201cwe,\u201d found to introduce ambiguity with respect to an agency (Jalilifar and Alavi, 2011). Increased inclination to voice disagreement contributed to greater assertiveness within the discourse of later sessions. The relationship between managing disagreement and assertiveness may be bidirectional or mutually reinforcing given that Lapadat (2007) reported that feelings of empowerment resulted from the expression of beliefs within a safe communication space. Additionally, reduced negatively inflected humour over time resulted in more positive sentiment, which can create a more positive atmosphere (Sneijder et al., 2018).\nDiscursive devices employed by John represented changes in self-presentation/self-disclosure. Discourse was initially characterised by repetition and alignment. This reinforced other speakers\u2019 discourse, avoided voicing an opinion that departed from the perceived norm, and reduced accountability for discourse. Pagliai (2012) suggested that a function of non-alignment in footing was to conceal disagreement with other speakers. However, the strategy, in this case, may have also served to conceal agreement with a statement creating discordance between actual and desired self-image. Congruently, disclaimers functioned to protect the speaker from presenting a negative self-image. The movement from predominant repetition to evasive strategies and use of disclaimers achieved less explicit avoidance of expression of opinion.\nMax\u2019s non-verbal and verbal communication generally expressed a more positive attitude toward the sessions and engagement over time. Increased preferred responses within adjacency pairs and enhanced social negotiation allowing disagreement achieved inter-subjectivity. Whilst Berglund (2009) suggested that disrupted turn agency does not always lead to incoherent interaction, within this context, dis-preferred responses tended to diminish relation, leading to tangential talk that disrupted focus. Development of interactional accomplishment within the group was demonstrated through increased emotional disclosure overtime. Whilst sometimes prompted by identification with the reading material, increases in this communicative strategy were also likely to occur due to other group member\u2019s discourse eliciting reciprocating responses and the development of familiarity and trust within the group over time.\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nIn keeping with the Theory of Change (Davis et al., 2016), participants demonstrated a shift from \u201cstuckness\u201d through expanding discursive strategies employed to accomplish social action. For example, there was an increased tendency for the use of listener-focussed language and preferred responses and reduced negatively inflected humour and avoidance strategies. These cases highlight how discourse can illustrate change and indicate readiness to accept learning and self-development. Characteristics of participant talk were determinable from the start of the intervention. It is, however, noteworthy that, whilst Shared Reading interventions within other populations have demonstrated effects following six weeks (Longden et al., 2015) changes within participant discourse for the current study were discernible from around six months. This is reflective of the gradual development of sessions, the poor concentration and impulsivity of some participants, and willingness to engage with and then discuss the material.\nFindings should be interpreted with consideration to study limitations. First, it is not possible to strongly assert that the changes illustrated in the discourse analysis are due to Shared Reading because participants had been receiving care and treatment, including medication and psychological therapy, at Ashworth Hospital for considerable lengths of time. One participant explicitly communicated that they had been at Ashworth Hospital for five years and two participants were preparing to transfer service toward the end of the intervention. Impracticalities and ethical issues render the elimination of many confounding factors difficult. Therefore, future research should employ a matched subjects design to assess the effects of a comparator intervention on discourse.\nAdditionally, it may be useful to investigate whether a similar expansion of linguistic devices persists in a female sample given that, controversially, linguistic elements may be stylistically stigmatised, associated with gender, age, and social status (M\u00fcller, 2005). A larger, more diverse sample would be required to determine the transferability of the current study\u2019s findings and learnings. However, recruitment and implementation of a study such as this pose considerable logistical challenges. Furthermore, generalisability has been deemed a controversial topic in qualitative research; with the intentions to investigate a particular phenomenon in-depth, greater importance is often placed on the understanding of circumstances as opposed to producing representative data.\nIn an attempt to account for confounds, measures of therapeutic alliance, facilitator experience, participant motivation (both degree of motivation and specific reason), personality trait scores, symptomology, and changes in medication that may affect concentration and/or vocal production should be recorded. Whether changes in discourse over time are mirrored in participant\u2019s social interactions outside the sessions could also be usefully investigated. This may also elucidate dynamics between participants outside the sessions.\nParticipants who dropped out of the intervention tended to be younger and at an earlier stage of illness than regular participants. Reasons for withdrawal were not pursued for ethical reasons, but voluntary feedback indicated that this was likely related to anxiety about being in a group, being recorded, concentration or interest. This may indicate that, within forensic settings, Shared Reading may be best suited to operate in tandem with or after some experience of therapy. Whilst it may be worth investigating the implementation of a Shared Reading group on a high dependency ward, it should be recognised that this environment is less conducive to undisturbed, confidential discussion and raises serious issues for audio and video recording in terms of research activity.\nOverall, participant discourse strategies over the duration of the intervention showed increasingly sophisticated social function through broadening of capacity to consider, assertiveness, avoidance strategies, and engagement. The current study\u2019s findings have practical implications for facilitators of therapeutic activity and group members. These results could be used to assess and develop criteria for interactional progress through signalling key areas for anticipated change in discourse. For example, lists of verbal expressions related to humility, assertiveness, engagement, and evasion could be developed and values assigned to assess linguistic change across therapeutic sessions, through either computerised or manual scoring.\nSupporting participants to establish methods for conveying opinion or managing disagreement through the use of colloquial, as opposed to medical or therapeutic discourse, may develop \u201ctrusted\u201d pathways of interaction that can be readily employed within day-to-day interaction in the outside world or other institutional settings. Heightened linguistic richness may also lead to greater receptiveness and responsiveness to therapy for those experiencing mental health issues, equipping individuals with a greater linguistic repertoire to explore their own narratives, in doing so promoting social activity and skills. Such changes within interaction and social behaviour can lead to cumulative changes in well-being."
