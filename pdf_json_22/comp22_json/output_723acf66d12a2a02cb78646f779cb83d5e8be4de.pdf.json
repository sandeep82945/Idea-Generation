    "abstractText": "Project governance is an important activity in agile software development (ASD) projects for project success. Middle managers are part of the governance structure in ASD projects. Despite the efficacy of project governance and existence of middle managers in agile teams, project governance and middle management in ASD projects are under-researched. This multiple-case study investigates the roles of middle managers in agile project governance activities within two Nigerian ASD projects through the lens of activity theory. We collected data in semi-structured interviews, observations, questionnaires, and company documents. Our findings show that middle managers performed 25 roles related to planning and coordination for project alignment and execution, continuous improvement and organisational change, agile and technical leadership, monitoring, and capability building. We conclude that middle managers are pivotal to project governance practice and the effectual functioning of agile teams in ASD projects. The study will help agile practitioners to better understand the roles of middle managers in agile project governance. Results from this work contribute to the \u2018middle management in agile\u2019 debate and offer an alternative view that may change beliefs about middle managers in agile project settings.",

Despite its importance, PG vis-a\u0300-vis ASD projects, is under-researched and not fully understood [13,23].\nMiddle managers (MMs) in ASD projects participate in project activities, relay senior management (top management) directives to lower-level personnel, ensure implementation of directives in projects, and communicate implementation progress reports back to senior management (SM). MMs in agile teams may\nc\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022 V. Stray et al. (Eds.): XP 2022, LNBIP 445, pp. 65\u201381, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-08169-9_5\ninclude Scrum masters as gatekeepers and product owners as stakeholder representatives [29], as well as line managers [1]. Although MMs exist in agile teams, there is a lack of clarity about the role of MMs in ASD projects [12,24], and Barroca et al. [6] show this is one of the top ranked challenges affecting agile teams. Agile projects are considered lightweight, self-organising, and flexible, hence practitioners question how \u2018management\u2019 and \u2018governance\u2019 fit in. Middle manaager (MM) role uncertainty may generate tensions within agile teams during task execution [12], thereby threatening team stability and project congruity.\nTo shed light on this topic, this study seeks to answer the question: What are the roles of middle managers in agile project governance? To answer, we conduct case studies of PG activities in ASD projects within two companies: HOLDCOY and BANKCOY, in order to determine the roles of MMs in agile PG.\nThis article is an extended version of [32], which presented preliminary findings from a single case study. In this extended article, we include further empirical data from additional interviews and observations conducted in the first case study and findings from a second case study to present a composite thematic model of middle management roles in agile project governance (PG)."

In project management, governance includes \u201cthe set of policies, regulations, functions, processes, procedures and responsibilities\u201d that are involved in establishing, managing, and controlling projects, programmes, and portfolios [2, p. 8]. PG is an important project activity with the capacity to advance project performance and success. It provides SM with crucial information to make informed investment and risk decisions regarding projects, while allowing developers to build products iteratively and incrementally under conditions of uncertainty [16]. PG enables operation of governance mechanisms, roles, and metrics, which allow project personnel to monitor project performance and risks in order to realise business value [31].\nKujala et al. [21] derived a six-dimensional PG framework, which Lappi et al. [23] synthesised with findings from their review of 42 agile studies to develop a framework conceptualising agile PG in six PG dimensions, viz., goal setting, incentives, monitoring, coordination, roles and decision-making power, and capability building. This agile PG framework by [23] answered the question: \u201cWhat is agile project governance?\u201d in Lappi [22]. The six PG dimensions include activities, agile practices, and roles that are utilised and performed by various actors in agile PG [23]. For example, agile PG actors include the project manager: acts as coordinator or administrator of agile team; agile coach: supervises agile capabilities in agile team; and Scrum master: manages team performance and sprints. They did not discuss the actors in the context of organisational levels they belong to, hence middle management was not considered. However, the study calls for further research to better understand agile PG across organisational levels and\nits pervading effects in organisations; \u201cfrom top management via projects to individuals\u201d [23, p. 54]. The authors also highlight weak organisation-project strategic connections as an agile PG issue and the need for further research to examine how PG structures and practices can help strengthen such connections.\nMiddle managers (MMs) are the intermediary workforce that link SM with other teams that operate in the lower echelon of an organisation [5]. They occupy the middle-level position in an organisation\u2019s governance structure, reporting to SM who provide strategic direction, and serving as nexus between SM and the workforce that executes core tasks at project-level [5]. In essence, MMs receive, consume and transmit strategic directives in top-down fashion, perform and oversee implementation activities, and communicate implementation reports to SM. According to Cheng et al. [8], MMs are subordinate to SM and supervise at least two layers of lower-ranking staff. Still, the positions \u201cin the middle\u201d may vary depending on organisation size and context [4]. For instance, several layers of people may be positioned \u201cin the middle\u201d in large organisations, and in the wider organisation they are all regarded as MMs. Smaller organisations may have fewer organisational levels and few people in the middle echelon.\nKalenda et al. [19] argues that agile teams are no longer expected to be managed by MMs. MMs are seen as liabilities to organisational agility because they tend to resist change and agile transformation initiatives [19]. Nevertheless, there is \u2018management\u2019 and \u2018leadership\u2019 in agile settings. Parker et al. [27] suggest when a manager embraces agile practices, the manager can become an adaptive leader while managing the agile team. Little is known about MM role in ASD projects [6,12,24]. Hoda et al. [17] examined self-organising roles in ASD teams and identified several self-organising roles that exist within agile teams, viz., mentor, coordinator, champion, promoter, translator, and terminator. They highlighted positive influences of SM in supporting self-organising agile teams, however, the role of MMs was not considered in the study. Shastri et al. [30] examined the \u201cagile manager\u201d role in agile project management in a generic context without specifying the managerial level. They identified four agile manager roles: coordinator, mentor, negotiator, and process adapter. Moe et al. [24, p. 16] mentions \u201cRedefining the managers [sic] role\u201d and \u201cRight level of responsibility\u201d as major barriers to effective functioning of self-organising teams, thus highlighting issues in ASD projects, which includes issues associated with middle management and governance. There is also a lack of understanding as to the decision-making power of MMs, and the legacy roles required in ASD projects [24].\nRegarding impact of MMs in ASD projects, Russo [29] reports in an agile transformation study that MMs were taking the roles of Scrum masters and product owners. They were ranked above developers. The MMs were hands-on in mediating between SM software expectations and daily development issues to develop a desired system. SM valued the domain knowledge and adaptability of the Scrum masters, who also served as gatekeepers that focused on agile values in the project environment. Scrum master leadership skills were also vital in dealing with various day-to-day project issues. Product owners ensured alignment\nbetween stakeholder expectations and completed software features. Hermkens et al. [15] argue that MMs will remain instrumental to organisational agility, albeit this brings changes to the role of MMs. [15] therefore calls for research to ascertain the impact of the agile approach on the middle management role, as well as ascertain the roles of MMs that are most contributory to organisational agility."

            "text": "This study adopts a qualitative and interpretive multiple-case study design. This is well-suited because it puts the researchers in the world of the study participants living the PG and middle management experience in the ASD project settings, thereby allowing them to interpret the views and experiences of the participants [33]. Case study design was selected because case studies are recommended when prior research is limited and under-researched [7]. In addition, case studies are particularly suited for practitioner-oriented studies aiming to address \u201cpractice-based problems where the experiences of the actors are important and the context of action is critical\u201d [7, p. 369], which applies to this study. Multiple-case design provides broader picture of issues in different organisations, which strengthens evidence and generalisability of findings [7]. A case study protocol was used as the agenda for inquiry at each case organisation.\nAgile PG is complex and multifaceted in nature given that it involves multiple actors, processes, tools, and socio-technical interactions aimed at achieving project success [23]. Consequently, our study demanded a flexible socio-technical theoretical framework with expansive analytical and interpretive power; activity theory lends itself to these demands [11,18,20]. Activity theory was used as the principal theory to develop an Activity-oriented Project Governance (APGov) conceptual framework (Fig. 1) to aid data collection, analysis, and results interpretation. In this present article, we only report on division of labour in relation to the roles of middle managers (MMs) in the agile PG activity. The unit of analysis for this study is the PG activity, which has ASD project as the main governance object, and middle management as one of the activity actors.\nData was collected from two companies between February and March 2020 and it involved 20 semi-structured interviews, three project team meeting observations, company documents, and questionnaires (which were only used to collect qualitative data about the companies and their ASD projects). The interviews, observations, and administering of questionnaires were performed by the first author. The use of semi-structured interviews facilitated information elicitation, interview question adaptation, and further probing, which helped to obtain firstlevel constructs (facts) and interesting insights from participants. Interviewees included three members of SM, ten MMs, and seven members of lower-level workforce (LOW) so as to obtain a variety of perspectives. Interviewees were asked to reflect on past project events. We used observations to complement other data sources and facilitate discovery of occurrences, subtleties, and actions in the cases [7]. For observations, we employed direct non-participant observation approach [9], and took \u2018outside observer\u2019 role [33]. Only one company was observed\nbecause the project in the second company was already completed at the time of data collection. Observations in the observed company were limited to three project team meetings due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Use of observations in one company did not affect overall results from both companies: observation data substantiated other collected data. For more sample population details, interview protocol, and other data sources details, visit https://bit.ly/3uL1Ryl.\nData analysis was performed using thematic network analysis [3]. A thematic network consists of (a) basic themes, which are the lowest-order premises found in the data, (b) organising themes, which are higher-order themes (categories of grouped basic themes) summarising main discoveries contained in the data [3], and (c) global theme, which is the superordinate theme that encapsulates \u201cthe principal metaphors in the data as a whole\u201d [3, p. 389]. Interview transcripts and observation notes were read several times and coded by applying a coding framework comprised of components of the APGov framework, research interests, and emerging discoveries from data [3]. NVivo and Microsoft Word were used to organise text segments into codes, which later formed themes for the construction of a thematic network interpreting various roles of MMs in agile PG. All possible roles of MMs referenced in the raw data were coded. This process produced a total of 40 codes, which were reduced to 25 basic themes (MM roles). The basic themes were grouped into organising themes (role categories)\nby considering the MMs\u2019 contexts. As a quality check, collected data and analysis findings were shared with participants. Responses were noted and helped clear up misconceptions. Cross-case analysis was done to identify similarities and differences in the MM roles across the two cases. The steps in the analysis process were performed by the first author and checked by the other authors to ensure analysis and interpretations accorded with data and research standards.\nTwo Nigerian case studies involving a financial technology (fintech) company; HOLDCOY, and a bank; BANKCOY, were undertaken. Both companies were undergoing agile transformation. The Nigerian technology and finance industries were germane for this study due to the use of agile development to create and deploy software solutions for financial services in the region [26]. Brief descriptions of each case organisation will now be given.\nHOLDCOY is a Nigerian fintech holding company that was established in 2008. It has five divisions and several functional areas (e.g., Operational Excellence (OpEx) team), which provide shared services to all the divisions. The company has used agile methods to implement and govern software projects for eight years. HOLDCOY\u2019s corporate customers include banks and other financial services providers. The research in HOLDCOY was limited to analysis of the PG activity and middle management in one of its divisions: the TECHCOY division, which was the agile project team executing the ASD project under examination. The project entailed development of a software to be used by financial services providers for inter-banking services to their customers and it had been ongoing for two and a half years. The project used Scrum, Kanban and Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) in its delivery with modifications tailored to suit the company. The TECHCOY agile project team performed daily Scrum meetings in weekly/biweekly sprints, sprint planning, sprint reviews, monthly retrospectives, and Monthly Performance Review (MPR) sessions. MPR is used by SM to review, provide feedback, and grade the performance of TECHCOY agile project team as a whole, as well as the performance of the sub-teams. It is also used to set, plan, and continuously review monthly project goals in collaboration with the TECHCOY agile project team. The observed MPR session was attended by SM (led by the Group CEO), TECHCOY agile project team, and other internal stakeholders. The observed daily Scrum and sprint planning meetings were attended by the TECHCOY agile project team members only.\nThe TECHCOY agile project team was co-located and cross-functional, comprised of 13 persons (ten full-time employees and three interns), which included three MMs: Head of Operations (P1), Head of Technology and Scrum Master (also a senior software developer) (P6), and Head of Business Development (P7). It was led by a divisional CEO (P9), who is not a MM but a member of HOLDCOY\u2019s SM team. The agile project team comprised of several sub-teams. Developers in the agile project team were mostly junior-level developers who had limited competency and industry domain knowledge. This was a concern. The developers were not competent to the point where they could perform their tasks unsupervised, hence middle management closely monitored the project (using code reviews for example) to ensure the quality and integrity of software\noutputs were not flawed. The agile project team spent project time travelling between their office and customer offices to collaborate with customer teams.\nBANKCOY is a Nigerian microfinance bank that has used agile methods for software project implementation and governance for three years. The bank was established in 2008. It implements projects to build software solutions for financial services to customers. The bank has an IT team of 40 staff which provide IT services, including in-house software development. The IT team is led by a Chief Information Officer (CIO) and supported by seven MMs.\nThe BANKCOY project was an ASD project to build a solution that allows customers transfer funds from other banks to their BANKCOY bank accounts. It was completed in nine weeks in 2019 through monthly sprints. The project used Scrum and Kanban. The agile project team was co-located and cross-functional. It comprised of 12 full-time employees, including six of the seven MMs: Project and Change Coordinator (P11), E-channels Manager (P12), DevOps Lead (also a software developer) (P13), IT Operations Manager (P14), Information Security and Assurance Lead (P16), and Head of Service Delivery (P18). The CIO (P21) is not a MM; he is part of the senior management (SM) team.\nThe MMs were part of the agile project team in each case. The three MMs in HOLDCOY and six MMs in BANKCOY\u2014all SM direct reports\u2014were the people officially recognised by SM in each company as the MMs in the respective agile project teams based on each company\u2019s organisational structure.

Comparing and combining the identified themes in the two cases produced a composite thematic network comprised of 25 basic themes that represent the roles MMs performed within the agile PG activity\u2019s division of labour in the two companies (see Fig. 2). The roles were grouped into five organising themes (role categories): Planning and coordination for project alignment and execution, Continuous improvement and organisational change, Agile and technical leadership, Monitoring, and Capability building, and linked to a global theme - Roles of middle managers in agile project governance. Through these roles, the MMs supported their respective agile project teams and contributed towards agile PG practice in their respective ASD projects.\nThere were similarities and differences regarding the MMs roles we found. We found that of the 25 roles, 24 roles were performed by MMs in HOLDCOY, whereas in BANKCOY 21 roles were performed by the MMs. Four roles in HOLDCOY were not found in BANKCOY, i.e., Pastoral Care Provider, Auxiliary Resource, Foreseer, and Auditor. One role in BANKCOY was not found in HOLDCOY, i.e., Mediator. Results suggest there were no differences regarding the role categories under which the MM roles were performed in the respective agile PG activities of the two companies. The following subsections and tabular figures describe each role under the five role categories. Results show that a MM\ncan perform one or more of these roles in different instances as circumstances demand during project implementation. Also, more than one MM can take up the various MM roles regardless of job title."

They helped to keep the agile project teams current regarding technologies they adopted for project delivery by showing interest in technology trends and keeping up to date with technologies being used in industry (P6 and P18).

P6 exercised business sense through his appreciation and understanding of the business opportunities associated with the ASD project, thereby helping to bring clarity of such opportunities to the agile project team\u2014opportunities for the company to quickly introduce a new product to customers through agile delivery and gain advantage over competitors. P1 helped his team to maintain agility by adapting weekly work approaches when necessary to ensure the team achieved project goals. The MMs engaged team members with a listening ear and emotional intelligence to ascertain work situations and personal issues that might affect project delivery (P1 and P6).\nAs Technical Leaders, MMs (P6 and P13) provided technical leadership by leading software development in the projects, supporting the agile teams with advanced technical expertise and hands-on support. P6 ensured work completed by developers were within project scope and aligned with project expectations.

            "heading": "5 Discussion",
            "text": "We have undertaken a multiple-case study to answer the question - What are the roles of middle managers in agile project governance? The previous section described results from two cases, which suggest that MMs performed 25 pivotal roles in agile PG. This section will discuss findings in light of related work.\nComparing our model with the agile PG framework in Lappi et al. [23], the MM roles and categories are represented in the six dimensions, albeit not in the same grouping; for instance, coordination (e.g., coordinator), capability building\n(e.g., coach), monitoring (e.g., goal and task inspector), goal setting (e.g., goal definer and interpreter), roles and decision-making power (e.g., decision-maker), and incentives (e.g., motivator). Our agile and technical leadership category fits into the roles and decision-making power dimension, in which Lappi et al. [23] highlights the adaptive nature of leadership provided by an agile project manager which is needed to handle seemingly increasing workload due to risks and greater coordination needs in autonomous teams. As an adaptive leader, the project manager also serves as coordinator or administrator for the agile project team [23]. This role interchange behaviour is similar to that of MMs in our study.\nRegarding continuous improvement and organisational change in our cases, MMs facilitate innovation, rule-making, auditing, process and procedural changes, and retrospectives. These mechanisms allow the project teams to review and reflect on how they operate and devise and implement improvements and strategies to address inefficiencies in their work processes, thus affecting not only their projects, but also PG practice in the organisations as a whole. Our MMs roles highlight the pertinence of continuous improvement and organisational change to agile PG. While Lappi et al. [23] categorises retrospectives as a mechanism within the coordination dimension, our study posits continuous improvement and organisational change as a possible dimension of agile PG warranting further research. A hallmark of agility is the continuous affinity for and responsiveness to change [10]. This should also reflect in the way agile PG is exercised. From our study, MMs facilitate continuous improvement [15] and change [1,5], hence contributing to a culture of PG in ASD projects that is not rigid and static, but one that is dynamic and mutative: constantly evolving so as to remain effective.\nFrom our study, middle managers (MMs) tend to switch between roles to cater for project needs that are occasioned by project events. There can be one or more MMs performing the same middle management role regardless of their job titles, which is how agile managers tend to operate in agile projects [30]. This dynamic, instantaneous, and transitory nature of the MM roles in agile teams during agile PG is characteristic of roles found in self-organised teams [17].\nGatekeepers, such as the MMs in our cases, are viewed as \u201corganizational actors that sit at the junction of a number of communication channels in such a way that they can regulate the flow of demands and potentially control decision outcomes\u201d [14, p. 11]. Hence, a gatekeeper is essentially an entity that controls \u2018who\u2019 or \u2018what\u2019 is given access to something, or one that controls the advancement of a thing from a particular state or condition to another. In Russo [29, p. 30], the MMs (Scrum masters and product owners) were collectively designated the \u201cgatekeepers between the top management directions and the implementation efforts\u201d. The Scrum masters in particular \u201cacted as gatekeepers, focusing on Agile values\u201d [29, p. 29], which is related to the Agile Leader MM role in our study and the agile manager mentor role in Shastri et al. [30] in that the three roles ensure project delivery follows the agile approach. The Scrum masters were also domain experts [29], similar to our Subject Matter Expert role. The\nproduct owners represented stakeholders and ensured software outputs matched user expectations [29]. This is similar to our Product Owner role.\nIn our study, middle management as a collective \u2018owned\u2019 the projects and acted as single point of accountability and oversight, ensuring tasks were completed by the right people to achieve stakeholder expectations and best project outcomes. This is closely related to the \u2018single point of accountability\u2019 PG function in agile settings [25]. Moran [25] argues that ultimately, any agile undertaking (e.g., project) must be traced back to a single person who has access to the necessary resources and authority to direct activities and can be held accountable for performance and outcomes. Despite being project owners by SM mandate, the MMs worked alongside their teammates with a shared project ownership and team autonomy mindset. For example, P1 believed that for their agile project to succeed, each person in the agile team had to own the project, as well as own their respective project tasks: \u201cthe only way an agile project can succeed is if your team members actually own this project and own each task\u201d (P1).\nAs Strategists, the MMs contributed to strategy making and implementation efforts within the two companies, as in Balogun [5], which argues that MMs are enabling and influential in defining and implementing strategy in organisations due to their intermediary position. This also links with the Coordinator role in our work in that MMs are intermediaries. As Coordinators, the MMs in our study coordinated the agile teams\u2019 interactions with internal and external stakeholders for optimal collaboration to achieve shared project goals. This is similar to an aspect of the agile manager coordinator role in Shastri et al. [30], where the agile manager coordinates team collaboration with customers and specialists, as well as collaboration within and between teams. The boundary spanning position of the MMs in our study gives them access to knowledge from across intra- and inter-organisational boundaries, thus providing substantial intelligence for generating and implementing useful ideas. Projects are apparatus in organisations that enable transformation of business ideas and strategies into achieved goals. In agile settings, weak strategic connections between organisations and their projects is a PG issue [23]. Our study suggests the strategic and coordination agency of MMs may potentially help strengthen organisation-project strategic connections in agile settings considering middle management\u2019s frequent participation in strategic and technical-operational multistakeholder exchanges.\nA few other MM roles we found match other findings in Shastri et al. [30]. For example, in our Coach role, MMs train teammates on new software tools for project work. They provide guidance and assistance while allowing teammates to own their project tasks. The MMs also assign minor tasks to teammates to build their know-how and aid their growth. This is on par with the coaching aspect of the mentor role in [30], which entails guiding and assisting teammates to complete tasks, and aiding their growth by giving them minor tasks to complete. The mentor role also builds team relations using different means, including organising team bonding activities. This is close to our Motivator role whereby MMs support and organise team bonding activities to inspirit teammates. It is, therefore, noteworthy that as multirole actors, MMs are vital to ASD projects\nand teams. Our study and other recent studies [1,15,29] call attention to the relevance and evident potential of MMs in present-day agility landscape.\nAs for limitations, we acknowledge our study involved a short period of fieldwork. This was due to COVID-19 pandemic. Still, useful data was collected leading to the discovery of 25 roles of MMs in agile PG. The nature of qualitative studies is subjective, however, our use of multiple data sources for corroboration strengthens validity of findings. The two case studies are limited to companies in Nigeria and the finance industry. The finance industry is an intensely regulated industry. The sensitive nature of business activities in such industry may demand a certain degree of oversight and control, which may influence how governance is performed and how MMs operate in ASD projects within such contexts. The small number of companies involved may limit generalisability of findings to our two cases. Nonetheless, the companies we studied are representative of companies that use agile approaches, hence companies with like contexts, structures, and projects may derive instructive insights from our research."

            "text": "Our study suggests that MMs are important to agile PG. As conspicuous and influential actors in agile teams, MMs perform a variety of pivotal roles through which they contribute to agile PG practice and support the effectual functioning of agile teams, thereby helping to accomplish mandated ASD projects.\nThis study has developed a thematic model of MMs\u2019 roles in agile PG that describes multiple roles, which MMs can perform when working alongside agile teams and governing ASD projects. It contributes to the \u2018middle management in agile\u2019 debate in hopes of prompting scholarly discussions on the topic. It contributes to filling a gap in knowledge as to the spectrum of middle management involvement and impact in agile PG and agile teams by offering alternate, clarifying, and optimistic views about the middle management role. It adds to studies on agile PG and MMs in ASD projects, which are limited. The study exemplifies the use of activity theory in agile PG research through its application of the APGov framework, and advances the use of activity theory in ASD research.\nOrganisations that use agile methods and have MMs may use the model of MMs\u2019 roles as a tool for (a) creating job descriptions and person specifications for recruitment of MMs, (b) education and training for continuing professional development of MMs and aspiring MMs, and (c) ensuring MMs maintain acceptable levels of job performance in the governance of ASD projects. The model should help MMs, SM teams, aspiring MMs, agile teams, and researchers to better understand the roles of MMs in agile PG practice, which may lead to stronger organisation-project strategic connections and project success, as well as foster organisational agility, better working relationships between MMs and their teammates in agile project teams, and further research. We encourage SM teams to involve agile MMs in strategic exchanges as they may possess unique technical-operational knowledge and insights regarding project work and complexities on the ground. Participation of MMs in strategic exchanges with SM can\nreinforce project teams\u2019 commitment, dedication, and ownership of ASD projects to ensure mission-critical initiatives are realised with short time to value.\nFuture work should further explore continuous improvement and organisational change as a PG dimension in ASD projects. Also, the roles of MMs in PG within additional ASD projects in finance, other industries, and other countries should be examined\u2014with larger sample size\u2014to validate, generalise, or build upon our findings. To further validate our findings, quantitative research is also suggested (e.g., determine the relative importance of the MM roles in agile PG).\nAcknowledgements.
