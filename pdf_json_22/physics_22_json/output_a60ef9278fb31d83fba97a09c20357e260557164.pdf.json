            "text": "General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM) are the fundamental ingredients of our understanding of Nature. The former describes the gravitational interaction, and the latter is in the bases of the Standard Model (SM), which describes the other three interactions (electromagnetic, weak and strong). Nevertheless, every attempt of unification has encountered unsolvable difficulties. Specifically, one can notice the very different role that spacetime plays in each one. In GR, spacetime is a dynamic object that interacts with matter; however, in QM spacetime is a fixed frame described by Special Relativity (SR). So attempts of unification lead to change our conception of spacetime. Unfortunately, we do not have energetic enough experiments to give us hints about how to approach to a Quantum Gravity (QG) theory, but one natural way to proceed is to look for low energy signals of QG due to the dynamical nature of spacetime. One of these signals could be a breaking or deformation of the fundamental symmetry under SR, the Lorentz invariance. This leads to two different ways to go beyond the SM, the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) [1, 2] and the Doubly/Deformed Special Relativity (DSR) scenarios [3]. Every effect of LIV and DSR should be very small correction to the SM at the energies we have explored so far; however, they could be important and measurable at high enough energies [4\u20136]. In addition, some models propose that these effects could be accumulative, so that they could become noticeable for particles traveling very large distances [7]. This encourages us to look for physics beyond the SM using observations of very high-energy extragalactic astroparticles, because they have energies orders of magnitude above the ones we can obtain in a laboratory, and also due to the fact that they involve propagation over very large distances, allowing us to observe possible accumulative effects. Among the astrophysical messengers, neutrinos take a special role because they already contain signs of new physics beyond the SM, like their masses. But also because they are highly noninteracting, so they can travel very long distances without disappearing from the flux. So very high-energy neutrinos are ideal particles to study accumulative effects in LIV. In this work we will consider the effects of LIV over the observed flux of very high-energy neutrinos. The main consequence is that the flux detected on Earth by IceCube [8], and by future experiments, would be modified with respect to the flux expected in SR. We start by introducing the LIV framework in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3 we describe this flux by a continuous evolution approximation. Nevertheless, this will not be enough to consider all the effects of LIV, so in Sec. 4 we will consider an instantaneous cascade approximation. Finally, in Sec. 5 we will discuss some applications of these simple models."

Then, the only change with respect to the SM should be a Modified Dispersion Relation (MDR) for neutrinos, i.e. | \u00ae\ud835\udc5d | = \ud835\udc38 ( 1 \u2212 \ud835\udefc ( \ud835\udc38\n\u039b\n)\ud835\udc5b) , (1)\nwith \ud835\udefc = +1 for a superluminal velocity or \ud835\udefc = \u22121 for a subluminal one. In this way we can use all the SM machinery for the computations of decay widths and cross sections by only taking into account the new MDR. A superluminal modification of the neutrino energy-momentum relation allows disintegrations that are forbidden in SM due to energy-momentum conservation. Specifically, now the neutrino is unstable and it can disintegrate through Vacuum (electron-positron) Pair Emission (VPE) and Neutrino Splitting (NSpl), processes depicted in Fig. 1. The VPE process consists of the disintegration of one neutrino into an electron-positron pair and a neutrino of lower energy. The pair can be produced through the emission of a boson \ud835\udc4d0 (neutral channel) for every flavour of the neutrino, or a boson \ud835\udc4a+ (charged channel) only for electronic neutrinos. However, in this work we will only consider the neutral channel (relevant 5/6 of the times)1 to ease the computations. Due to the mass of the electron and positron of the final state, the process of VPE has an energy threshold, given by [5]\n\ud835\udc38VPEth \u2254 (4\ud835\udc5a 2 \ud835\udc52\u039b \ud835\udc5b)1/(\ud835\udc5b+2) , (2)\nwhere \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52 is the electron mass.

            "text": "We want to study how these two new disintegrations affect the flux of detected neutrinos. For that, let us first consider an individual neutrino traveling freely from an extragalactic source to our detector at Earth. In order to deal with cosmological distances, we are going to use the redshift \ud835\udc67 as a way to follow the trajectory of the neutrino. Then, the neutrino is emitted at \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52 and detected at \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc51 = 0. During this trip, the neutrino will suffer a continuous adiabatic loss of energy due to the expansion of the Universe. This energy loss can be characterized by a differential equation\n1 \ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc67 = 1 1 + \ud835\udc67 .\n(5)\nThis process is deterministic, so the energy of the neutrino is perfectly defined along the trajectory. If this is the only mechanism of energy loss, like in SR, its propagation is trivial and the relation between the emission and detection energies is given by\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc52 = (1 + \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52)\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 . (6)\nIf we consider now the LIV framework presented in the last section, the neutrino can suffer additionally disintegrations through VPE and NSpl. For simplicity, let us consider only VPE in this section. Identifying the initial and final neutrino as the same, we can picture the VPE as a process of energy loss due to the emission of an electron-positron pairs. The disintegration is intrinsically stochastic; therefore, during the propagation, the neutrino has some probability of losing energy, which is proportional to the total decay width of VPE [9],\n\u0393VPE(\ud835\udc38) = 32\ud835\udc38 5\n192\ud835\udf0b3 \ud835\udc3a2\ud835\udc39\n[ (\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc4a \u2212 1/2)2 + (\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc4a )2 ] (\ud835\udc38 \u039b )3\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udf09VPE\ud835\udc5b , (7)\nwhere \ud835\udf09VPE\ud835\udc5b is a constant dependent on \ud835\udc5b,\n\ud835\udf09VPE\ud835\udc5b \u2254 1 3 \u222b 1 0 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65(1 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1)3(1 \u2212 \ud835\udc653)\n= 1 4 \u2212 3(\ud835\udc5b + 2) (\ud835\udc5b + 5) + 3 (2\ud835\udc5b + 3) (2\ud835\udc5b + 6) \u2212 1 (3\ud835\udc5b + 4) (3\ud835\udc5b + 7) .\n(8)\n3There exists a more general way to write the NSpl decay width for any \ud835\udc5b, but the energy fraction terms only factorize without mixing for \ud835\udc5b = 1 and \ud835\udc5b = 2.\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 3 2 9\nAdditionally, if there is a disintegration, the neutrino has a certain probability distribution for its final fraction of energy, given by\nPVPE(\ud835\udc65) \u2254 1 \u0393VPE(\ud835\udc38) \ud835\udf15\u0393VPE(\ud835\udc38, \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc65 = 1\n\ud835\udf09VPE\ud835\udc5b\n1 3 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b+1)3(1 \u2212 \ud835\udc653) . (9)\nThen, the energy of each individual neutrino becomes undetermined during its propagation making impossible to follow its evolution. However, if instead of considering the propagation of one neutrino we consider a large enough number of them, these probabilities should allow us to study the typical (mean) evolution of the energy along the trajectory. The differential variation of the energy \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc38 in a differential time \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 is given by the product of the probability of disintegration, \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 \u0393VPE(\ud835\udc38), and the mean energy loss, \u2212\ud835\udc38 \u27e81 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\u27e9.

(12) will be very strong. We can call this the strong regime. On the contrary, if the energy is below the effective threshold, the energy loss by VPE is negligible, recovering Eq. (5). We can call this the standard regime. In this way, the process of VPE has two different thresholds: a real one, \ud835\udc38VPEth , and an effective one, \ud835\udc38VPE\ud835\udc5f . The greater of the two will control where the VPE stops, but the relative magnitude between both is a function of the scale of new physics and the order of the correction,(\n\ud835\udc38VPEth /\ud835\udc38 VPE \ud835\udc5f\n)5+3\ud835\udc5b \u2261 ( \u039b0\ud835\udc5b/\u039b )\ud835\udc5b/(\ud835\udc5b+2) , (17)\nwith \u039b0\ud835\udc5b a constant given by\n\u039b0\ud835\udc5b \u2254 (4\ud835\udc5a2\ud835\udc52) (5+3\ud835\udc5b)/\ud835\udc5b (\n32 192\ud835\udf0b3 \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc3b0\n[ (\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc4a \u2212 1/2)2 + (\ud835\udc602\ud835\udc4a )2 ] \ud835\udf09VPE\ud835\udc5b ) (2+\ud835\udc5b)/\ud835\udc5b . (18)\nWe are interested in linear and quadratic corrections, i.e. \ud835\udc5b = 1 and \ud835\udc5b = 2 respectively, and values of \u039b below or equal to the Planck scale. As we see in Fig. 2, under these conditions, \ud835\udc38VPEth is always greater than \ud835\udc38VPE\ud835\udc5f . This implies that the real threshold is the relevant scale to study where the VPE stops, but additionally, it implies that the energy loss is always in the strong regime because, for every neutrino suffering VPE, its energy will fulfill \ud835\udc38 \u2265 \ud835\udc38VPEth > \ud835\udc38 VPE \ud835\udc5f . Let us consider neutrinos emitted with energy above the threshold, so they can produce VPE. Combining the VPE energy loss, Eq. (12), with the standard adiabatic energy loss, Eq. (5), we can get a differential equation for the evolution of the energy of a neutrino emitted with energy above the VPE threshold [11],\n1 \ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc38 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc67 = 1 1 + \ud835\udc67 +\n( \ud835\udc38\n\ud835\udc38VPE\ud835\udc5f )5+3\ud835\udc5b \u27e81 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\u27e9 (1 + \ud835\udc67) \u221a\ufe01 (1 + \ud835\udc67)3\u03a9\ud835\udc5a +\u03a9\u039b . (19)\nThis equation will rule the evolution of the energy until the neutrinos reach the threshold energy or are detected. In the last case, one can integrate4 Eq. (19) from the emission until the detection,\n4To integrate Eq.

(21)\nLet us notice that, contrary to the trivial case shown in Eq. (6), now the equation relating emission and detection does not always have solution for every combination of the energy of emission, detection, and location of the source. In fact, we are restricted to the parameters that make the term inside of the square brackets larger than zero, i.e.\n\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52, 0) < 1\n\u27e81 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\u27e9 ( \ud835\udc38VPE\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 )5+3\ud835\udc5b \u226a 1 , (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 \u2265 \ud835\udc38VPEth > \ud835\udc38 VPE \ud835\udc5f ) . (22)\nThen we expect \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52 \u2248 0 for every energy of detection greater or equal to the VPE threshold, and we see that the number of sources capable to contribute to the detected flux of energy \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 tends to zero. We do not expect to detect neutrinos above \ud835\udc38VPEth . If we now consider neutrinos detected with energy below the threshold, Eq. (19) will rule the evolution of their energy until the neutrinos reach the threshold energy at some point \ud835\udc67VPEth of the trajectory. From that point the evolution is trivial, so we can solve \ud835\udc67VPEth as a function of the detection energy,\n\ud835\udc67VPEth (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51) \u2254 \ud835\udc38 VPE th /\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 \u2212 1 , (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 \u2264 \ud835\udc38 VPE th ) . (23)\nIntegrating Eq. (19) from the emission to \ud835\udc67VPEth (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51), we get that the relation between the emission and detection energy is now\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc52 = (1 + \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52)\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 [ 1 \u2212 ( \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc38VPE\ud835\udc5f\n)5+3\ud835\udc5b \u27e81 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\u27e9 \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc5b ( \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc38 VPE th /\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 \u2212 1 )]\u22121/(5+3\ud835\udc5b) , (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 \u2264 \ud835\udc38VPEth ) . (24)\nOne more time, the existence of solution of the previous equation imposes\n\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc5b ( \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc38 VPE th /\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 \u2212 1 ) < 1 \u27e81 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\u27e9 ( \ud835\udc38VPE\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 )5+3\ud835\udc5b , (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 \u2264 \ud835\udc38VPEth ) , (25)\nbut in contrast to the previous case, we now have to possibilities: (\ud835\udc38VPEth > \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 > \ud835\udc38 VPE \ud835\udc5f ) or (\ud835\udc38VPEth > \ud835\udc38 VPE \ud835\udc5f > \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51). In the last case, the condition (25) is easily satisfied without imposing any condition over \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52, so one can expect to detect neutrinos below \ud835\udc38VPE\ud835\udc5f . However, the most interesting case is to consider the most energetic neutrinos below the threshold, i.e. (\ud835\udc38VPEth > \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 > \ud835\udc38 VPE \ud835\udc5f ), because in that case Eq. (24) only has solution if \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52 is below some \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51), given by\n\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51) \u2254 \ud835\udc67VPEth (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51) + ( \ud835\udc38VPE\ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udc38VPEth\n)4+3\ud835\udc5b ( \ud835\udc38VPE\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 ) 1 \u27e81 \u2212 \ud835\udc65\u27e9 \u221a\ufe03 (1 + \ud835\udc67VPEth (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51))3\u03a9\ud835\udc5a +\u03a9\u039b ,\n(\ud835\udc38VPEth > \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 > \ud835\udc38 VPE \ud835\udc5f ) .\n(26)\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 3 2 9\nLet us notice that \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51) is a monotonic decreasing function on \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 . Then, there exists some energy \ud835\udc38cut for which \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc38cut) will coincide with the closest source \ud835\udc67min. This means that we are not going to find any neutrino with energy above \ud835\udc38cut, because this would require a source closer than the closest source. Recalling that for linear and quadratic corrections, and \u039b below or equal the Planck scale, \ud835\udc38VPEth is always greater than \ud835\udc38 VPE \ud835\udc5f , we can expect \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc50 (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51) \u2248 \ud835\udc67VPEth (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51), so we can conclude that considering VPE implies a cut-off in the flux of detected neutrinos and it is located at an energy \ud835\udc38cut given approximately by\n\ud835\udc38cut \u2248 \ud835\udc38VPEth /(1 + \ud835\udc67min) . (27)\nUsing that the threshold energy is a function of \u039b and \ud835\udc5b, we can write the cut-off energy as\n\ud835\udc38cut \u2248 \u039b\ud835\udc5b/(\ud835\udc5b+2)\n1 + \ud835\udc67min (2\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52)2/(\ud835\udc5b+2) . (28)\nThis allows us to predict approximately the location of the cut-off as a function of the parameters of the new physics. But this relation can also be written in the other way around, so that we can use it to put constraints in the possible values of \u039b given an observation of neutrinos of energy \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 ,\n\u039b > (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 (1 + \ud835\udc67min)) (\ud835\udc5b+2)/\ud835\udc5b (2\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52)\u22122/\ud835\udc5b .

            "text": "In the previous section we have seen that, due to the peculiar energy dependence of the VPE decay width, particles emitted with energies above \ud835\udc38VPEth reach the threshold energy almost instantaneously and are detected with energy \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 \u2248 \ud835\udc38VPEth /(1+ \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52). As the NSpl decay width has the same energy dependence, this encourages us to approximate both VPE and NSpl as instantaneous effects. For that, we are again interested in a regime in which the effects are strong, i.e. \u0393VPE(\ud835\udc38) \u226b \ud835\udc3b0 and \u0393NSpl(\ud835\udc38) \u226b \ud835\udc3b0.

(32)\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 3 2 9\nSo we obtain that for NSpl, similarly to VPE, if the energy of emission is above the effective threshold the effect can be considered as instantaneous. In this case, in contrast to VPE, it does not exist a real threshold, but \ud835\udc38NSpl\ud835\udc5f will control when the NSpl stops. It is also worth to notice that dividing Eqs.

Let us assume that \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc52 neutrinos were emitted with very high-energy such that \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc52 > \ud835\udc38VPEth > \ud835\udc38 NSpl \ud835\udc5f ; then, they will be able to produce both effects, NSpl and VPE. Specifically, they will disintegrate through both kinds of processes until their energies reach the VPE threshold, and then, they will produce only NSpl until reaching the NSpl effective threshold. Let us assume that in the first part of the trajectory each neutrino suffers \ud835\udc5d VPE and \ud835\udc5e NSpl disintegrations. Then, we expect that\n\ud835\udc38VPEth = \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc52 ( \u27e8\ud835\udc65\u27e9VPE ) \ud835\udc5d ( \u27e8\ud835\udc65\u27e9NSpl )\ud835\udc5e , (33)\nwhere \u27e8\ud835\udc65\u27e9VPE and \u27e8\ud835\udc65\u27e9NSpl are the average fraction of energy of a secondary neutrino after a disintegration through VPE and NSpl, respectively. But we also know that the the number of disintegrations through each process is proportional to their decay width. Thence, for enough disintegrations we also expect\n\ud835\udc5d/\ud835\udc5e \u2248 \u0393 VPE(\ud835\udc38)\n\u0393NSpl(\ud835\udc38) =\n( \ud835\udc38 NSpl \ud835\udc5f\n\ud835\udc38VPE\ud835\udc5f\n)5+3\ud835\udc5b \u2255 \ud835\udc5f . (34)\nUsing that \ud835\udc5d = \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5f, we can solve Eq.

(35) Now, once the neutrino has reached the VPE threshold, it will continue losing energy through NSpl until reaching \ud835\udc38NSpl\ud835\udc5f . Assuming there has been \ud835\udc5e\u2032 disintegrations, we get\n\ud835\udc38 NSpl \ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udc38 VPE th\n( \u27e8\ud835\udc65\u27e9NSpl )\ud835\udc5e\u2032 \u2192 \ud835\udc5e\u2032 =\nln ( \ud835\udc38VPEth /\ud835\udc38 NSpl \ud835\udc5f ) \u2212 ln ( \u27e8\ud835\udc65\u27e9NSpl\n) . (36) Under the instantaneous approximation, the NSpl effective threshold will be reached very close to the source. In this way, we can consider an instantaneous cascade in which the \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc52 neutrinos emitted with energies \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc52 > \ud835\udc38VPEth > \ud835\udc38 NSpl \ud835\udc5f will instantaneously produce 3\ud835\udc5e 3\ud835\udc5e \u2032 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc52 neutrinos of energy \ud835\udc38NSpl\ud835\udc5f . If instead the \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc52 neutrinos were emitted with energies \ud835\udc38VPEth > \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc52 > \ud835\udc38 NSpl \ud835\udc5f , using the same procedure as before, we get that the \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc52 neutrinos can be substituted with 3\ud835\udc5e \u2032\u2032 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc52 neutrinos of energy \ud835\udc38NSpl\ud835\udc5f , being\n\ud835\udc5e\u2032\u2032 = ln\n( \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc52/\ud835\udc38NSpl\ud835\udc5f ) \u2212 ln ( \u27e8\ud835\udc65\u27e9NSpl\n) . (37) In any case, all the neutrinos emitted above the NSpl effective threshold will produce a bunch\nof neutrinos that will propagate as if they were emitted from the source at \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc52 with energy \ud835\udc38 NSpl \ud835\udc5f , so\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 3 2 9\nwe do not expect to detect neutrinos above\n\ud835\udc38cut \u2248 \ud835\udc38\nNSpl \ud835\udc5f 1 + \ud835\udc67min = \u039b3\ud835\udc5b/(5+3\ud835\udc5b) 1 + \ud835\udc67min\n( 32\n192\ud835\udf0b3 \ud835\udc3a2 \ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc3b0 \ud835\udf09 NSpl \ud835\udc5b\n)\u22121/(5+3\ud835\udc5b) , (38)\nor written the other way around, we get a bound on \u039b, \u039b > (\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 (1 + \ud835\udc67min)) (5+3\ud835\udc5b)/(3\ud835\udc5b) (\n32 192\ud835\udf0b3\n\ud835\udc3a2 \ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc3b0 \ud835\udf09 NSpl \ud835\udc5b\n)1/3\ud835\udc5b , (39)\nfrom the observation of neutrinos with an energy \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 ."

            "text": "We have seen that a superluminal velocity due to a MDR makes neutrino unstable above certain threshold energies, allowing it to disintegrate through VPE and NSpl. In consequence, we expect a cut-off in the detected spectrum of neutrinos, and, using simple models, we have made an estimation of the energy of the cut-off as a function of the values of the new physics parameters \u039b and \ud835\udc5b, and the distance to the closest source, \ud835\udc67min. It is interesting to note that a cut-off in the neutrino spectrum originated from LIV would not only directly point to the LIV parameters (\u039b and \ud835\udc5b), but also to \ud835\udc67min, being informative on the distribution of the sources. This is a consequence of the instantaneous approximation, which, as we have seen in this study, is indeed a generic characeristic of the LIV processes affecting the propagation of very high-energy neutrinos. The estimation of the location of the cut-off can be used to constrain the values of \u039b compatible with current observations of very high-energy neutrinos. In particular, one could pay special attention to the observations of IceCube, where one can see a lack of events above a few PeV [8]. This is specially striking if one takes into account that at 6.3 PeV one would expect to observe the Glashow resonance [12] (production of a non-virtual \ud835\udc4a\u2212 boson by the interaction of electron antineutrinos), boosting the probability of detection at that energy. Before 2016, the most energetic detected neutrino was around 2 PeV, and some works [13] proposed that this could be a consequence of a cut-off in the detected spectrum caused by LIV disintegrations, so they performed Monte Carlo simulations considering VPE and NSpl for different values of \u039b, obtaining that for a detection event around 2 PeV (with \ud835\udc5b = 2, considering sources from \ud835\udc67 = 0.5 to \ud835\udc67 = 2), one can expect \u039b > 1.4 \u00b7 1011 PeV \u2248 0.011\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc43. Instead of performing a simulation, we can now apply the simple model discussed here with the same conditions (\ud835\udc5b = 2, \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 = 2 PeV, \ud835\udc67min = 0.5), and we obtain \u039b > 3.6 \u00b7 1010 PeV \u2248 0.003\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc43. While the simulation gives a more restrictive constraint, the simple model can provide a estimation of the order of magnitude. On 2016, an event compatible with the Glashow resonance was reported by IceCube [14], showing that there is not a cut-off at 2 PeV. In order to improve the constraint over \u039b, new Monte Carlo simulations have to be done; however, using the simple models, one can get a direct estimation, obtaining that for \ud835\udc5b = 2, \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 = 6.3 PeV and \ud835\udc67min = 0.5, the value of \u039b must be above 3.0 \u00b7 1011 PeV \u2248 0.024\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc43. One can argue that if \u039b is very large, \u039b \u223c \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc43, we are still not sensitive to that new physics, and the apparent cut-off in the spectrum is due the fact that the sensitivity of the detector is restricted\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 3 2 9\nto energies below 10 PeV. In that case, for \u039b = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc43, one can use the simple models to estimate a location of the cut-off, which for \ud835\udc5b = 2 in the less restrictive case (\ud835\udc67min = 0) is around \ud835\udc38cut \u2248 72 PeV. The next generation of detectors, like IceCube-Gen2 [15], aim to detect neutrinos with energies up to EeV = 103 PeV, so we expect that in the very near future the detectors will be sensitive to signatures that stem from \u039b around the Planck scale. Additionally, it could be interesting to identify a LIV signature, not only from the cut-off, but through the whole energy dependence (shape) of the detected neutrino flux. Nevertheless, a prediction of the flux energy dependence is beyond these simple models, requiring a Monte Carlo simulation to identify any modification due to LIV."
