1. **Investigate the potential of andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels for the treatment of other types of skin cancer.** The current study focused on the efficacy of andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels against A431 cells, a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line. Future research could explore the effectiveness of these emulgels against other types of skin cancer, such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.


2. **Evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels.** The current study evaluated the safety and efficacy of andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels in vitro and in vivo. However, long-term studies are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of these emulgels in humans.


3. **Investigate the mechanisms of action of andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels.** The current study demonstrated that andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels can inhibit the growth and proliferation of A431 cells and induce cell cycle arrest. However, the mechanisms of action of these emulgels are not fully understood. Future research could investigate the molecular mechanisms by which andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels exert their anticancer effects.


4. **Develop andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels for the treatment of other types of cancer.** The current study focused on the potential of andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels for the treatment of skin cancer. However, andrographolide has also been shown to have anticancer activity against other types of cancer, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer. Future research could investigate the potential of andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels for the treatment of these other types of cancer.


5. **Formulate andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels using different methods.** The current study used a nanoemulsification method to formulate andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels. However, other methods, such as microemulsification and self-emulsification, could also be used to formulate these emulgels. Future research could investigate the use of different formulation methods to develop andrographolide-rich extract-loaded emulgels with different properties, such as stability, release rate, and skin penetration.
