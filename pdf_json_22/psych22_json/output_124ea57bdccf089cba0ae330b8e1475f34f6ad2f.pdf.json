The purpose of this study was to examine\nboredom experienced by EAP students in online classes and investigate the\neffects of an autonomy-oriented intervention program on students\u2019 boredom.\nThe boredom scale was administered to 84 students before and after the\nautonomy-oriented intervention. By designing and implementing autonomy-\noriented intervention based on the autonomy enhancement model, positive\nresults were obtained with reduced levels of boredom. The results revealed\nthat the intervention was effective and boredom was reduced to a noticeable\nextent. In addition, the qualitative results contributed to our understanding\nof the learners\u2019 experiences throughout the intervention. We conclude the\nstudy with implications for EAP instructors to employ different pedagogical\ninterventions to mitigate negative emotions in online EAP classes.\nKEYWORDS\nboredom, EAP students, autonomy-oriented intervention, online EAP classes, pedagogical intervention\nIntroduction\nLearning English involves interaction, which in turn makes it an essentially emotional venture (Richards, 2020). It has been reported in various studies that among various emotions involved, language learners are susceptible to frequently experiencing boredom in university contexts (e.g., Sharp et al., 2017; Derakhshan et al., 2021). The Control-value Theory of achievement emotions (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun et al., 2010) posits that learners may find themselves \u201cin or out of control of achievement activities\u201d (Pekrun et al., 2010, p. 534), and boredom is aroused when achievement emotions are conceptualized as not having value and as lacking control over the learning process (Acee et al., 2010; Pekrun et al., 2010).\nBored students show \u201clower perceived control\u201d (Pekrun et al., 2010, p. 533). Moreover, Sharp et al. (2016) stress that less engagement and less opportunity to exert\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\ncontrol on classroom events are among the main reasons for boredom. In the same vein, Zawodniak et al. (2021) remark that students are bored in teacher-centered classes in which students are provided with less freedom of choice. Given that, if students are provided with freedom of choice and autonomy over content and method of studying, they experience less boredom (Acee et al., 2010; Sharp et al., 2016, 2017). By promoting autonomy in learners, negative emotions like boredom would decrease and evidence from earlier research corroborates this assumption (e.g., Sharp et al., 2016; Yazdanmehr et al., 2021; Zawodniak et al., 2021).\nOn the other hand, with the significance of social distancing announced by World Health Organization (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020) as a result of the spread of COVID19, online education has gained momentum (Ribeiro, 2020). As a result, higher education practices have been influenced by the changes in their delivery method, the incorporated material, mode of teaching, and also interactions (Adedoyin and Soykan, 2020). Review of literature on online classes indicates that students often feel bored in their online English language courses (Derakhshan et al., 2021; Pawlak et al., 2021). Due to the lack of simultaneous oral and visual presentation of materials (De Beni and Mo\u00e8, 2003), the encoding of the input might be cumbersome in online classes and students\u2019 concentration might waver and they might get bored during the class. Moreover, students in EAP (English for academic purposes) classes are susceptible to experiencing boredom due to teacher control and repetitive and boring activities (Zawodniak et al., 2017), disengagement (Pawlak et al., 2020a), which leads to severe negative consequences in the classroom. This aversive emotion is also tied to lower academic achievement (Mousavian Rad et al., 2022) and negative cognitive perceptions such as perceptions of time passing slowly (Goetz et al., 2014), cognitive passivism (Li et al., 2022).\nInvestigating the underlying factors contributing to boredom and when and how students succumb to this negative emotion would not be enough and different pedagogical interventions are required in order to reduce it to a noticeable extent (Pawlak et al., 2020a, 2021). Due to the dire consequences of these negative emotions, an intervention program based on autonomy-oriented instruction, which reduces boredom by increasing students control over the learning process (Sharp et al., 2016; Zawodniak et al., 2021), is designed and implemented to alleviate students\u2019 boredom in EAP classes. Moreover, paucity of appropriate pedagogical interventions is considered as a prominent factor leading to academic failure (Pawlak et al., 2021). The present study\u2019s educational significance is justified through the autonomy-oriented intervention program as it sheds light on how teachers can deal with negative emotions and raise their sensitivity to students\u2019 emotions in EAP classes. To best of our knowledge, few, if any, studies have taken measure to reduce boredom through a pedagogical intervention program. Therefore, the present study\naims at implementing an autonomy-oriented intervention program which intends to increase the autonomy of EAP students and in turn decrease boredom experienced during online EAP courses."

            "text": "Learners\u2019 emotions, positive or negative, exert influence on the process of language learning and their attitude toward what they learn (Resnik and Dewaele, 2020; Richards, 2020). Among different types of emotions, boredom is the most frequently experienced one in different educational contexts (Goetz et al., 2014). Despite being the subject of many studies in psychology, this concept has recently gained momentum in L2 (second language) research (Chapman, 2013; Kruk and Zawodniak, 2017). Boredom has been also trivialized in schools or higher education settings since teachers attribute boredom to other factors such as students\u2019 laziness, anxiety, or personality characteristics (Macklem, 2015).\nBoredom is considered as \u201ccomplex, multifaceted, and evasive,\u201d however, it can be discussed in relation to its \u201csymptoms, causes, stability, degree of intensity, and valence and arousal\u201d (Derakhshan et al., 2021, p. 2). This negative emotion is mainly manifested in disengagement, dissatisfaction, and negative emotional perceptions emanating from nonarousing settings (Lewinski, 2015). Bored students often feel detached from their goals and are less involved in the activities and as a result, they reflect signs of disengagement from the educational settings to which they belong (Henry and Thorsen, 2018; Zawodniak et al., 2021). As for the causes of boredom, different factors have been mentioned, among which unchallenging tasks (Larson and Richards, 1991), teacher control (Hill and Perkins, 1985), trivializing the importance of activity at hand (Pekrun et al., 2010), and having no purpose for learning (Yeager and Walton, 2011) have received attention. According to the control-value theory of achievement emotions (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun et al., 2010), learners succumb to boredom when they attach little value to the task and when they lack control over the learning process. As for the deleterious effects of boredom, depression (Macklem, 2015), disengagement and lack of interaction (Tvedt et al., 2019), reticence (Shea, 2017), L2 speaking anxiety (Galante, 2018), demotivation (Mercer and D\u00f6rnyei, 2020), among others, have attracted empirical attention recently.\nUntil recently, boredom was mainly investigated indirectly and in relation to other negative emotions. For example, Kormos and Csiz\u00e9r (2014) probed the influence of motivational factors and self-regulatory strategies on Hungarian EFL high school students, university students, and adult learners\u2019 autonomy. The results suggested that the efforts put by learners were\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\npertinent to their potentials for overcoming boredom. Being the first study to explore boredom explicitly and directly in L2 classes, Chapman (2013) explored German L2 students\u2019 beliefs about boredom and their three teachers. The results indicated that feelings about their teachers were the main predictor of boredom and also textbook activities, less challenging classes, and unengaged peers resulted in students\u2019 boredom.\nOther research projects focusing on boredom in L2 classes were conducted mainly in the Polish educational context (Kruk and Zawodniak, 2018, 2020; Pawlak et al., 2020a; Zawodniak et al., 2021), and very recently in Asian contexts (Li and Dewaele, 2020; Derakhshan et al., 2021; Li, 2021; Li et al., 2021; Nakamura et al., 2021), some of which are briefly outlined here. In their quantitative study, Pawlak et al. (2020b) investigated differences in the boredom level experienced by second- and third-year English major students. The findings suggested that second-year students experienced more boredom than thirdyear students due to the content provided during the 3-year program. Moreover, they indicated that factors underlying boredom were mainly uninteresting topics of discussion, negative past experiences, negative perceptions, and paucity of creativity and involvement. Regarding studies conducted in Asian context, Nakamura et al. (2021), using surveys and focus group interviews, investigated the predictors of students\u2019 boredom in English oral communication courses. The results showed nine factors among which mismatch between internal leaner factors and external classroom factors such as activity mismatch, challenging tasks, and lack of adequate proficiency in L2 skills played influential role in students\u2019 boredom."

Three recently published articles have investigated boredom during online courses (Li and Dewaele, 2020; Derakhshan et al., 2021; Pawlak et al., 2021). Li and Dewaele (2020) collected information from 348 university students to explore the predictive role of boring online language classes. The results indicated moderate but higher levels of boredom in online classes in comparison to face-to-face classes. The analysis revealed that learners who had higher emotional intelligence and learning achievement perceptions experienced lower levels of boredom in online classes. Adopting a qualitative measure, Pawlak et al. (2021) examined the difference between online and face-to-face classes and also content-based and skill-based courses in relation to boredom. The results indicated that online classes were more boredom-inducing than face-to-face classes and found contentbased classes more boring. In another recent study in Iran, Derakhshan et al. (2021) examined the causes and also remedies to boredom of English major students during online classes\ndue to the pandemic by drawing on data from open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. It was revealed that teacher-learner related factors, computer-related factors, task-related factors, and student-related factors were the main causes of boredom. Moreover, five categories for coping with boredom including making the class livelier, improving IT infrastructure and individuals\u2019 IT know-how, involving students in discussions and encouraging participation, improving interpersonal relationships, and changing the lifestyle were identified."

            "text": "Learner autonomy (LA) is considered to be the definitive goal of language learning process over the years (Teng, 2019) since it is inexorably tied to promoted L2 achievement (Little, 2007). According to Holec (1981), LA is one\u2019s ability to shoulder the responsibility for their learning process which may include decision making in terms of the objectives, content, method, evaluation of the possible outcomes of learning. LA is conceptualized as \u201ca precondition for effective learning\u201d (Benson, 2013, p. 1), which implies that when autonomy is developed and enhanced, the process of learning languages is facilitated since the learner has taken charge of their learning.\nLanguage teachers have the responsibility to enhance autonomy in their learners to ensure that learning takes place (Benson, 2011). It is believed that enhancement of autonomy leads to efficiently dealing with negative emotions such as boredom (Kormos and Csiz\u00e9r, 2014; Zawodniak et al., 2021). That said, teachers who make attempts to foster autonomy can provide opportunities which increase students\u2019 engagement and involvement in the classroom (Reeve and Jang, 2006) which in turn will lead to lower levels of boredom (Mercer and D\u00f6rnyei, 2020). For example, Kormos and Csiz\u00e9r (2014) explored the effect of motivational factors and self-regulatory strategies on EFL learners\u2019, university students\u2019, and adult learners\u2019 autonomous learning. The results showed that their efforts were linked to their ability to overcome boredom. They inferred that controlling negative emotions results in autonomy enhancement of learners.\nTo date, studies have focused on the level of boredom and also the relationship of the concept with other variables such as achievement, anxiety, etc. However, what remains underexplored is investigating the effects of pedagogical interventions on this emotion. Different researchers have called for implementing pedagogical interventions to mitigate boredom (e.g., Sharp et al., 2016; Pawlak et al., 2020a, 2021)."

Each approach was implemented in two separate sessions. The first and last sessions of the intervention were allocated to completing the questionnaires to ensure that learners take enough care in responding to each question. Moreover, during the first session, the researcher illuminated the process of data collection and intervention, and briefed learners on their responsibilities during the intervention. Moreover, to tap into the inner processes through which learners developed their autonomy and reduced their boredom, they were asked to deliver weekly reflective journals to the researcher via Telegram messaging application."

Since this is an intervention program and the changes need to be scrutinized meticulously, two classes with the total number of 84 students were selected.\nThe participants were aged between 18 and 22 years. The majority of the participants had studied English language in private institutes or at least, to improve their English language, they had read English materials apart from what they had been taught during their education at school, like reading books, newspapers or watching English programs.\nDue to the pandemic, the classes were held online at the time of data collection. The online classes in Iran are held using different online platforms such as Adobe Connect, Big Blue Botton, and Skyroom among which Adobe connect was used for the purpose of this study because of the affordances it provides. This application is user friendly, but the most notable reason for which it was used is related to the breaking out mode through which the main room can be broken into different rooms in which students can do different pair-work and group-work activities."

The present instrument consists of 23 seven-point Likert-scale statements, which tap into the intensity of boredom in the L2 classroom. Higher scores on each statement of the scale and also entire scale will indicate higher levels of boredom (Pawlak et al., 2020a). Moreover, the results of explanatory factor analysis for 23 items revealed factor loadings above 0.30 indicating that all items had large contributions to their underlying constructs. To ensure the content validity, two experts in Applied Linguistics were requested to check each item carefully. Despite the high proficiency level of students, all items of the inventory were translated into Persian, the learners\u2019 mother tongue, in order to diminish the possibility of any misunderstanding. Then, the internal consistency reliability of the inventory was calculated for the learners partaking in this study and it was 0.91 based on Cronbach\u2019s alpha.

In the second phase of the study, the researcher implemented 10-week intervention program in which approaches of autonomy enhancement were employed with the intention of reducing boredom. Each session of the program focused on one approach including resourcebased approaches, learner-based approaches, classroom-based approaches, and curriculum-based approaches (Benson, 2011). Each approach was fully implemented via different tasks during the class in order to increase autonomy and diminish the negative states of boredom. Resource-based approaches provide learners with opportunities to direct their own learning and emphasize independent interaction with learning materials, learner-based approaches focus on learner development and changes within the learner, classroom-based approaches attend to the control learners have over the learning process including planning and evaluation, and finally, curriculumbased approaches emphasize learner control over the curriculum and learning material (Benson, 2011). Finally, in the third phase, after the intervention program was finished, learners were asked to complete the questionnaires on boredom again in order to make comparison and see whether any changes had been made in the level of this negative state.\nAs for the processes through which learners developed their autonomy and reduced their boredom as a result of taking part in each session of the intervention, they were required to reflect on their experiences after each session of the intervention. The questions included: How did you feel during the class? Talk about your positive and negative emotions during the class, did you feel engaged in the tasks? What did you like about the activities and classes? Did you feel bored? If yes, please describe your feeling, etc. The reflections were in form of written dairies which were sent to the researcher through Telegram in a weekly schedule."

            "text": "One approach to fostering autonomy is classroom-based approaches which may include different instructional activities such as peer teaching, project works, and peer assessment. The review of literature indicates that lack of cooperation among learners is a crucial factor in students\u2019 boredom (Yazdanmehr et al., 2021; Zawodniak et al., 2021). Therefore, adopting classroom-based approaches such as pair work, group work, and project-based approaches would foster learner autonomy. In this study, classroom-based approaches are operationalized in terms of pair work and group work in which students need to do different activities. In online adobe connect classes, there is the possibility of breaking the class into groups and at the same time monitoring their activities. In the first session of the pair work, students were asked to divide the reading into two sections and each student summarized one section and explained to her/his partner. Then they were asked to\ndo the comprehension questions in pairs. Finally, the answers to questions were checked in the class as a whole. In the second session of this approach, the class was divided into seven groups. First, some discussion questions were raised and then the students had to discuss them in their groups. While they were doing the task, the teacher observed the rooms to ensure their participation and passed her comments if necessary.\nMoreover, the fact that students have no choice in English classes have been an important matter in making students feel bored (Pawlak et al., 2020a; Yazdanmehr et al., 2021; Zawodniak et al., 2021). Therefore, adopting curriculum-based approaches in which students can have a role in determining the content of the classes can make them feel autonomous and give them the right to choose their learning material (Benson, 2011). Curriculum-based approach has been conceptualized via adopting process-based syllabus through which learners play an important role in deciding the content and process of the class (Benson, 2011). In the present study, students are involved in developing process-based syllabus for two sessions based on their language needs and interest. That said, learners negotiated the content of classroom. In doing so, different poles were run in order to determine the general area which they preferred to work on. Because the coursebook taught at university is mainly reading-based, most of them selected grammar and listening skills to work on. Then, the general area of grammar was narrowed down to several parts including tenses, conditionals, modals, clauses, etc. As for two sessions of this approach, the instructor taught some grammatical points to the students via adopting task-based language teaching. Regarding the listening skill, the researcher assigned a task to work on their listening and also enhance learner-centered approaches. In doing so, students were divided to seven groups and each group had to choose a Ted Talk relevant to the content of the reading passage of the coursebook. In their groups, they had to watch the Talk, work on the new words, summarize it and then the leader of the group presented the main points to the class.\nResource-based approaches are important in fostering learners\u2019 autonomy since using extracurricular activities and task could be a way to reduce boredom (Yazdanmehr et al., 2021). Hill and Hannafin (2001) defines resources as the \u201cmedia, people, places, or ideas that have the potential to support learning\u201d (p. 38) and the effectiveness of these resources is interconnected with their potentials to offer collaborative experiences and the sense of engagement with other people in learning process (Benson, 2011). During the intervention sessions, different resources were utilized. For instance, one session was allocated to watching a 15-mins video clip about the content of the unit (how civilizations end). The students were asked to watch the video clip and then answer some questions. First the questions were answered individually then they were asked to discuss the content of the videos in groups. Moreover, in order to draw on technological affordances in EAP classes, students had to do certain tasks and then share with the instructor on Telegram messaging application. For instance,\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nthey were required to share their ideas about one of the topics (Social robots, exploring space, etc.) and record their voices then share them via telegram. The other session was allocated to analyzing a piece of newspaper in the class. Each group could bring their own newspaper to the class so that they can analyze the structures and new words utilized in the newspaper.\nAmong the main causes of boredom, we can refer to teacher-centered classes in which students get bored as a result of long teacher talk, teacher control over classroom procedure, and teachers\u2019 instructional practices (Derakhshan et al., 2021; Yazdanmehr et al., 2021; Zawodniak et al., 2021). Therefore, moving from teacher-centered to learnercentered approaches would help alleviate students\u2019 boredom. Learner-centered approaches which are among autonomy enhancement techniques utilize a variety of activities to promote autonomy (Benson, 2011) and in turn reduce boredom. In this present study, learner-centered approaches are operationalized through adopting task-based teaching which are valid methods for promoting autonomy (Viera, 2017). The inclusion of tasks into the traditional syllabi would provide opportunities for communicate language use which in turn would enhance autonomy (Bygate, 2016). During each session of the intervention, different tasks such as watching video clips, analyzing newspapers, focusing on Ted Talks, discussing different topics were implemented. For each task, the three phases of pre-task, while task, and post-task activities were considered and implemented. The summary of the approaches utilized are provided in Table 1."

They introduced six stages of inductive analysis including familiarizing yourself with your data, generating initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes and producing the report. Following these six steps, we initially collected the data inductively to discover the general themes of the journals and then it was coded deductively by drawing on the theoretical background of the study including the approaches to autonomy\nenhancement.

            "text": "The findings indicated positive effects of the autonomyoriented intervention on learners\u2019 boredom in EAP classes, which was caused through four different approaches including\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nclassroom-based, curriculum-based, resources-based, and learner-based approaches. The significant decline in learners\u2019 boredom can be attributed to the tasks which were applied during each session of the intervention. In addition to the statistical results, the qualitative data gathered weekly contributed to our understanding of the learners\u2019 experiences throughout the intervention. The qualitative data allowed a much more fine-grained understanding of how students were able to manage this negative emotion. The themes and subthemes highlight the prominent role of pedagogical interventions on mitigating negative emotions during online courses (Derakhshan et al., 2021).\nBoredom of students in online classes could be explained in terms of teachers long and monotonous talks in the classes (Derakhshan et al., 2021; Pawlak et al., 2021). The results showed that providing students with opportunities through which they can experience peer teaching and active participation in the classes could contribute to reduction of the monotony of the class. This shred of evidence is supported by cooperative learning tasks through which teacher assigns different responsibilities to the learners and monitors them while conducting the tasks, which would lead to arousing positive emotions in learners (Mennim, 2017; Pawlak et al., 2021). In addition, due to the lack of interaction and cooperation in online classes, students succumb to boredom (Derakhshan et al., 2021; Yazdanmehr et al., 2021). However, using different approaches such as pair works and group works created resemblance to face-to-face classes in which students had great interactions with each other. As indicated in their journals, they had a sense of socialization to their community when engaged in pair work tasks. Moreover, adopting classroombased approaches contributed to the psychological status of learners. Since they were interacting with their friends, they did not fear to make mistakes. In addition, they added a sense of humor to the tasks, which is in line with other studies (Derakhshan et al., 2021; Pawlak et al., 2021) which deem humor and fun as factors reducing boredom in online classes.\nEqually important is students\u2019 choice in the content and procedure of the classroom. According to Pekrun et al., 2010, p. 533, bored students have \u201clower perceived control\u201d over their learning process. This can be explained with reference to control-value theory of achievement emotions (Pekrun, 2006; Pekrun et al., 2010) which highlights the fact that when lacking control over the learning process, students will feel bored. Therefore, if we provide them with freedom of choice, they perceive themselves in control and accordingly, feel less bored (Yazdanmehr et al., 2021). This is supported by Yazdanmehr et al.\u2019s study in which the case participant attributed boredom to teacher control over the class which would cause disengagement in online courses. In addition, this is corroborated by findings of the study conducted by Pawlak et al. (2021) whose participants found content-based classes less boring in comparison to\nlecture-based presentations since they had more freedom to choose the content of the class. The participants of this study believed by choosing the content, they will be more autonomous which is in line with Benson\u2019s (2011) approach to fostering autonomy namely curriculum-based approaches. Moreover, these approaches adopted during the online classes were less similar to typical university classes which seemed novel to the students and made them more engaged and less susceptible to boredom. As Pawlak et al., 2021, p. 19 remarks being \u201cless reliant on university level English instruction\u201d can made students more autonomous and alleviate their boredom in online classes.\nRegarding the role of resource-based approaches in reduction of autonomy, learners were satisfied with the fact that they are using different resources with which they will be faced in out of class activities. This is in line with the findings of Pawlak et al. (2021) who found that relating tasks to real life activities will make the instruction more practical and reduce students\u2019 boredom in online classes. However, when the tasks have nothing or little to do with real life activities, students feel bored (Zawodniak et al., 2021). Using authentic materials such as analyzing newspapers or Ted Talks also leads to reduction of boredom (Benson, 2011; Derakhshan et al., 2021). One important antecedent of boredom is reported to be disengagement of learners (Pawlak et al., 2020a). Therefore, provision of different resources which seems engaging and entertaining would mitigate boredom among university students (Pawlak et al., 2020a) since preventing disengagement is a direct strategy for overcoming boredom (Macklem, 2015). In the same vein, teachers in Pawlak et al.\u2019s (2021) study utilized different strategies among which increasing students\u2019 engagement was the most popular one to mitigate boredom. In addition, resource-based approaches provide opportunities for developing autonomy and control over the learning process through combination of self-access materials and class material to expand different skills in learners (Benson, 2011). Inclusion of various sources such as online resources can also be beneficial in mitigating boredom as well (Pawlak et al., 2021).\nOn the other side, the tasks utilized in the class play a pivotal role in alleviating students\u2019 boredom. According to the participant\u2019s journals, when the instructor adopted new tasks, they were engaged and this resonates well with the studies which regarded repetitive tasks as main indicator of students\u2019 boredom (Derakhshan et al., 2021; Yazdanmehr et al., 2021). In the same vein, Zawodniak et al. (2021) also remarks that similarity in the tasks leads to feeling bored therefore, adopting novel approaches would provoke students\u2019 engagement and reduce their boredom. Moreover, if instructors can adopt different pedagogical instructions and refrain from repetitious teaching methods, boredom would diminish in students in online courses (Derakhshan et al., 2021). Furthermore, tasks can offer communicative contexts in which students get involved in\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nlanguage learning and therefore foster their autonomy (Bygate, 2016; Viera, 2017). Task-based language teaching promotes learner-centeredness which requires taking one step away from traditional teaching methods and moving forward to learner empowerment and autonomy enhancement (Viera, 2017). As implied by qualitative analysis, learners were able to develops strategies for learning language which is a way of developing autonomy in learners (Benson, 2011), which leads to reduction of boredom (Mercer and D\u00f6rnyei, 2020). As Harmer, 2007, p. 394 remarks, learner-centered approaches help learners to be \u201cthe doers rather than the recipients of learning action,\u201d which results in higher positive emotions and lower negative emotions. Moreover, learners posited that time passed by quickly during the learner-based approaches while one major factor for boredom is considered as the perceptions of time slowing down (Sharp et al., 2016)."

The findings of qualitative and quantitative measures revealed significant changes in the boredom of learners before and after our intervention. The study, therefore, has brought to the fore the need for online English courses to be delivered in a more engaging manner which utilizes different approaches to foster the autonomy of learners so that they can take charge of their learning and as a result overcome their boredom.\nThe present study offers pedagogical approaches helpful in reducing boredom among EAP learners at university levels. Introducing variety and avoiding repetitive tasks in the classroom provides ample opportunities for engaging students since task repetition over a long period of time leads to less engagement and eventually boredom of students. Moreover, teachers should refrain from acting authoritative in the classes and do their best to encourage involvement during different activities.\nDue to COVID-19 pandemic and other unforeseen disastrous pandemics, there must be attempts to enhance the quality of online classes. The inadequacies of online courses should be dealt with through strategic instructions which engage students in various types of tasks. Moreover, by keeping balance between adopting different approaches such as whole class, pair work, group work mode would lead to reduced boredom (Zawodniak et al., 2021)."

Future studies should take a further step to explore the effect of individual differences on how students feel bored and how they would react to different pedagogical interventions. Moreover, the enhancement of autonomy requires instructors who are familiar with the autonomy enhancement approaches since this process is \u201ca more active process of guidance and encouragement to help learners extend and systematize the capacities that they already possess\u201d (Benson, 2011, p. 91). Another significant limitation with which this study was faced is related to the lack of control group since having two groups of participants would yield more accurate results. Therefore, caution must be taken in the interpretation of the results and future studies might include a control group for obtaining more generalizable and accurate results."
