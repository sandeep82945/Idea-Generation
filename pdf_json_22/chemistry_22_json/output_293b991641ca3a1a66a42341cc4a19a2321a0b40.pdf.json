However, limited by the poor solubility and difficulty in crystallization, the single crystal structure of the condensed product was not obtained until 1981,1b which hindered the understanding and application of CB[n]s.

Crystallography study shows that all the single-ring CB[n]s have a congenial height approximate to 6.08 A\u030a, and their inner/outer diameters range from 2.64 A\u030a/5.41 A\u030a to 6.46 A\u030a/8.84 A\u030a. Thanks to the hydrophobic cavities with adjustable volumes (from 12.38 A\u030a3 to 416.49 A\u030a3, more details in Fig. S1\u2020), CB[n]s have been widely applied in catalysis,2a photochemistry,2b drug delivery,2c biosensing,2d gas storage,2e and separation science,2f etc.2g\u2013k\nWith the prosperity of porous materials in the past decades, scientists have gained developing understandings of the recognition mode between CB[n]s and guest molecules.

            "text": "Firstly, some commonly used density functional methods were screened for the geometry optimization task, and the single point energies of the optimized structures were summarized. As shown in Table 1, the relative energies of the optimized structures were much lower than those of crystal structures, which implied that the monomer structure extract from periodic crystal structure was not the minimal point and geometry optimization was prerequisite for ab initio study. As shown in the rst raw, energies of CB[n]s optimized by semi-empirical method PM7 were much higher (about 40 kcal mol 1) than those optimized by DFT methods, implying insufficient\nprecision of PM7 for CB[n]s optimization task. Comparatively, GFN2-xTB provided a much better result with accuracy approaching to B3LYP. Considering of the calculation cost and hardware dependencies, GFN2-xTB is suitable and recommended for pre-optimized calculation. Among the selected DFT methods, B3LYP-D3, PBE0, and M06-2X showed similar capabilities for geometry optimization, while wB97-D3 was much inferior (about 8 kcal mol 1 higher). The B3LYP functional did not combine D3 version of Grimme's dispersion raised energies about 2 kcal mol 1 higher than those calculated from B3LYPD3, inferring dispersion correction had a certain impact on the optimization of CB[n]s structures. By combining with the RMSD data (see Table S1\u2020), it can be seen that PBE0 changed the crystal structure in the minimal level. In order to t the crystal structures to the greatest extent, structures optimized by PBE0 were chosen for the following wavefunction analysis.\nWith the optimized structures in hand, bond order index analysis was then performed. Bond connection in CB[n] skeletons could be summarized in 5 types, as shown in Scheme 1, which are C1\u2013C2, C2\u2013N3, C4\u2013N3, C4\u2013O5, and C6\u2013N3. With n enlarging, bond order indexes of C4\u2013O5 signicantly decreased (from 1.9521 to 1.9161), while those of C1\u2013C2 and C4\u2013N4 tinnily increased (from 0.9474 to 0.9561 and from 1.0446 to 1.0603). Specially, bond order indexes of C2\u2013N3 and C6\u2013N3 held a tendency to increase rst and then decrease (0.8999/ 0.9158 / 0.9103 and 0.900 3 / 0.9207 / 0.9103). As the chemical structures shown on the right, eight-membered rings (blue ring) constituted of C2\u2013N3 and C6\u2013N3, and ve-membered rings (red ring) constituted of C1\u2013C2, C2\u2013N3, and C4\u2013N3, hence the rigidity of the ring could be described by the involved bond order indexes. In other word, the growth of the bond order indexes of C1\u2013C2 and C4\u2013N3 implied the stability raised in the ve-membered rings with n increasing. And eight-membered rings were most stable when n equalled to 7. As a result, CB[7] was less deformed than other CB[n]s, and CB[7] should be the most stable and rigid compound among the selected structures.\nApparently, the bond order index changes of C1\u2013C2, C2\u2013N3, C4\u2013N3, and C6\u2013N3 were closely related to those of C4\u2013O5, and we assumed that the bond order index decreases of C4\u2013O5 as n increasing were associated with the LP and ring tension. As shown in Fig. 2, the LP were visualized by Suresh's method,8c where isosurface value equalled to the minimal add 10 kcal mol 1 were drawn. Apparently, owing to the limitation of the ring size, LP overlapped in CB[5] and CB[6]. The LP overlapping reserved electrons in high density and made hydrogen bond prone to form with those doners contributing\nScheme 1 Mayer bond order index variation of CB[n] skeletons with n enlarging.\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 10014\u201310019 | 10015\nFig. 2 Lone pair electron distribution in CB[n]s.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Similar to steric effect, the overlap of LP brought repulsive force, which pressed on the C4\u2013O5 bond and shorten it. In addition, the overlap of LP might squeeze each other and force the electrons to reow to the C4\u2013O5 bond. With the ring size enlarging, the overlap of LP gradually decreased in CB[7] and CB[8], and nally became independent in CB[10]. Ring enlargement decreased LP overlap and made room for keeping LP, which determined the Mulliken charges population of oxygen as CB[5] owned the minimal negative value ( 0.3522) while CB[10] owned the maximum negative one ( 0.3976). Ring tension decreased with n enlarging (more evidences in Fig. S2\u2020), leading to enhancement of coplanarity of the urea functional groups, thus improved the conjugation of C]N bonds. Hence, those electrons formerly restricted to C]O bonds could be more shared by the urea functional groups, resulting in the decrease and increase of bond order indexes of C4\u2013O5 and C4\u2013 N3 respectively, and Mulliken charge population of nitrogen became more negative ( 0.0858 to 0.0981)."

Thus, ESP study brings insight into more in-depth understanding of host\u2013guest recognition. The van der Waals surface map colored by ESP of CB[n]s (n \u00bc 5, 6, 7, 8, 10) were summarized in Fig. 3. It can be clearly identied that the negative ESP value distributed in the both ends, above/below the carbonyl oxygen, and the positive ESP value distributed in the middle of the structures, on the outside of hydrogen. The up-down distributed negative ESP area were electron-rich, where cation or electron-decient species were prone to be trapped. Owing to the enlargement of the pumpkin-like shape from CB[5] to CB [10], the surface outside of hydrogens expanded, resulting in gradually increasing ratio of the positive ESP surface area (the red area increased in histogram). However, the same change brought opposite effect to the negative ESP surface. The enlargement of the CB[n]s departed the carbonyl oxygen, which decreased their LP overlap and made negative ESP value less negative (the blue area shied to 0 in histogram). Combined with the LP distribution analysis above, we can infer that electron density increased because of ring tensions in compact rings. Therefore, electrostatic attraction held a greater strength among the smaller CB[n]s. By inuence of the distances and angles of the LP, CB[5] and CB[6] usually preferred to cocrystallize with cations. On the other hand, the electronneutral ESP value mostly distributed inside the structures.\n10016 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 10014\u201310019\nThe inner surface gradually became larger with the enlargement of CB[n]s, leading those low-polarized structures tended to be trapped into the cavity.

Strong attraction (isosurface colored in deep blue) and repulsion (isosurface colored in deep red) existed between Mg2+(H2O)4 and CB[6] of Mg\n2+(H2O)4@CB[6], and we inferred it should be a manifestation of strong coordination bonds. Neutral molecules and those compounds which cannot donor hydrogen to form hydrogen bonds preferred to be trapped within the cavities and form complex structures, for example, CO2@CB[5]*, I2@CB[6], and Az\n+@CB[8]. IGM pointed out the repulsion and dispersion betwixt the host and guest in CO2@CB[5]* and I2@CB[6] were in medium intensity (isosurface mostly colored in bright green and bright grey-green), whose isosurface were tattered and in small area. Relatively, isosurface in Az+@CB[8] was much more diffuse, and coloured method showed that the host\u2013guest interactions were stronger (isosurface colored in green and dark grey-green).\nThe result of EDA qualitatively matched with the basis set superposition error (BSSE) corrected complexation energies.

Generally, ions held a 5 to 10-times of electrostatic intensity than neutral molecules did, and electrostatic force was a vital factor to keep polarized guest outside the host's cavity. On the other hand, dispersion was related to molecular volume and interaction surface area, and dispersion was the main contributor for maintaining guest trapped in cavities.\nEDA histogram indicated that electrostatic force played a negative role in stabilizing the complex structures for CO2@CB[5]*, which could be ascribed to LP repulsion. Carbonyl oxygens of CB[5]* in both ends were in negative ESP value (Fig. 3), the same as oxygens of CO2. Groups with same charge repels each other and repels and raises up energy. Therefore, the most stable conformation was formed when CO2 was stuck inside the cavity, where electrostatic repulsion of the both ends offset each other out and dispersion can be improved to the maximum level as the largest contact surface was achieved.\nThe interaction modes found in these complex structures consistent with the conclusions drawn by ESP analysis, that is high-polarized structures tended to interact at both end of CB [n]s while low-polarized structures preferred to be trapped in the central cavities. The example of I2@CB[6] implied that non-polarized molecule trapped inside the cavity could be stabilized without electrostatic, and maintained only by van der Waals forces. And the example of Az+@CB[8] disclosed that dispersion intensity could be expanded remarkably when fully-trapped guests owned large VDW surface. Hence, more attention should be paid for the contribution of dispersion, which was even more effective in reducing the energy of the system than electrostatics when large-sized molecular were trapped in CB[n]s. The effect of dispersion was a key role in the applications such as drug delivery, molecular recognition and separation science for CB[n]s, and it was the rst time discussed by visualization method in qualitative/quantitative."
