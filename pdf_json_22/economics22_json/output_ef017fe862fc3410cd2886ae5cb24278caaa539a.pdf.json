    "abstractText": "This article is dedicated analyzing the interdependence of oil prices and exchange rate movements of oil exporting countries (the Russian ruble, Euro, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Brazil real, Nigerian naira, Algerian dinar). The study also considers risk-based oil market spillovers in global crisis periods with integrated decision recommendation systems. For this purpose, a fuzzy decision-making model is created by considering the bipolar model and imputation of expert evaluations with collaborative filtering. The main contribution of this study is both its econometric analysis and evaluations based on expert opinions. This helps reach more crucial results. All three of the recent shocks (2008, 2012, 2020) in the oil market are transmitted to foreign exchange markets of oil-producing countries. At the same time, the last shock of 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been fully reflected on the Russian ruble exchange rate. Correlation parameters became weaker in the last year, as the Russian ruble correlation coefficient fluctuates between \u2212 0.5 and 0.5. However, before 2020 the spillover effect had a higher significance (in the range from \u2212 0.8 to \u2212 0.1). Nigerian naira and Algerian dinar were showing almost the same movements, while the Russian Ruble was in a different trading range.",

            "text": "The spillover effect on currency exchange rates in oil exporting countries changed after the pandemic-induced financial crisis beginning in 2020. The novelty of this study is the relationship between oil price market volatility and exchange rate movements of oil exporting countries. This paper proves the idea that the spillover effect in Algeria, Nigeria, and Russia became weaker after the beginning of the pandemic-related crisis. The choice of oil exporting countries is motivated by academic studies about the interdependence between the oil prices dynamics and exchange rate movements (Al-Awadhi et\u00a0al., 2020; Altig et\u00a0al., 2020).\nThis article builds on the ideas described in previous works (Mikhaylov, 2018; Norouzi et\u00a0 al., 2020; Ramelli & Wagner, 2020; Salisu & Akanni, 2020). During the studied period, the zero-coupon yield curve of oil exporting countries flattened, acquiring a positive slope inherent to a \"healthy\" economy. Prolonged increases in labor productivity reduce real marginal costs over a long period of time and lead to lower inflation. In general, the model of endogenous growth in oil consumption and inflation has already been described in sufficient detail.\nThe motivation for choosing the topic of interdependence between oil prices dynamics and exchange rate movements is based on previous research papers (Norouzi et\u00a0al., 2020; Ramelli & Wagner, 2020; Salisu & Akanni, 2020).\nThe theoretical basis for addressing the topic of interdependence between the oil prices dynamics and exchange rate movements is the literature review fundamentals (Szczygielski et\u00a0al., 2021; Wen et\u00a0al., 2021). Recent studies show that the spillover effect on currency exchange rates in oil exporting countries responds to innovation process, economic growth and energy markets (Mazur et\u00a0al., 2021; Narayan, 2020; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2021).\nThe research paper makes contributions to the growing literature about the effects of COVID-19 on the spillover effect on currency exchange rates int oil exporting countries (Fang et\u00a0al., 2021; Szczygielski et\u00a0al., 2021; Wen et\u00a0al., 2021). Recent studies have shown how the spillover effect has changed in oil exporting countries. Moreover, another evaluation is also performed regarding risk-based oil market spillovers in global crisis periods with integrated decision recommendation systems. For this purpose, a fuzzy decision-making model is created by considering bipolar q-ROFSs (Q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Sets), M-SWARA (Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis), ELECTRE (\u00c9Limination Et Choix Traduisant la REalit\u00e9) and imputation of expert evaluations with collaborative filtering (Bhuiyan et\u00a0al., 2022; Ker\u0161uliene et\u00a0al., 2010). Another important contribution of this study is to make both econometric analysis and evaluations based on expert opinions. This helps reach more effective results.\nThis study argues that the exchange rate variability has an asymmetric effect on international trade flows. The study of Bahmani-Oskooee and Aftab (2017) shows that prices of trade goods respond to volatility of the exchange rate in an asymmetric manner. Additionally, exchange rate volatility affects trade flows in an asymmetric manner in both the short- and long-term (Bahmani-Oskooee & Aftab, 2017). Therefore, this study argues that exchange rate volatility responds to trade flows of\n307\n1 3\nIntegrated decision recommendation system using\u2026\nboth imports and exports in an asymmetric manner. The exchange rate is the topic of interest for many researchers particularly in developing countries as it bridges a country with the rest of the world, as it determines the relative prices and competitive position of a country in the international market (Aliyu, 2010). The topic of exchange rates is a prime interest for those countries that shifted their policy from fix to floating exchange rate systems.\nThese studies use methods such as least squares regression, panel regression or simple co-integration. Furthermore, almost all studies conducted assumed that oil prices affect exchange rate volatility symmetrically. Although recently BahmaniOskooee and Aftab (2017) propose that prices of trade goods and trade flow respond to volatility of exchange rates in an asymmetric manner."

            "text": "Exchange rate volatility is defined as the persistent fluctuations of exchange rates garnered broader attention in recent studies due to its major effect on developing economies. Developing economies interact with developed countries, and are consequentially confronted with volatility on their foreign exchange markets and its subsequent impact on exports and the state\u2019s trade balance (Bahmani-Oskooee & Wang, 2007), volume of country investments, growth of employment in country, growth of inflation, output growth rate, international trade and more macroeconomic indicators, specifically those evaluating the economic activity in the country.\nThe available literature on exchange rate volatility and oil prices does not provide clear conclusions on whether the impact of exchange rate volatility is positive, negative or both. Many studies examine the short-, intermediate-, and long-term volatility spillovers between developed (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, UK, and US) and emerging BRICS (Brazil, Russia, China, India, and South Africa) stock markets and strategic oil futures markets.\nIn the empirical findings of previous studies, the net effect of oil prices on exchange rate volatility is inconsistent. Thirdly, there is no link in exchange rate volatility and oil prices. Thus, the association of exchange rate volatility of oil exporting countries and oil prices is still inconclusive. There are many reasons for this inconsistency in literature.\nTheoretically, the inconclusiveness is due to the different attitude regarding risk that international traders have. Some are risk-averse while some are risk-loving. Risk-averse traders substitute international trade with domestic trade to avoid exchange rate volatility. While risk-loving investors increase international trade to earn more profit as compensation in case of favorable effects of exchange rate volatility on trade flows. The higher volatility of exchange rates creates higher profit opportunities for risk-neutral investors during corresponding periods in the market. Forward markets reduce the volatility\u2019s influence but do not make markets more affordable or attractive to small firms. Empirically, some recent studies conclude that the indeterminate results of past studies are due to the over-reliance on aggregated trade flows and weak econometric techniques.\n308 A.\u00a0Mikhaylov et al.\n1 3\nThe effect of exchange rate volatility at the industry level is studied (Dutta, 2018; Jammazi et\u00a0al., 2017; Ji et\u00a0al., 2018). The authors find that the correlation is different from industry to industry and does not show unidirectional impact. After the mixed findings of previous studies, the effect of exchange rate volatility on trade is neither entirely significant nor completely unidirectional. It differs for the horizon of study and the market of interest, thus requiring more disaggregated trade data for future research.\nThe relationship between exchange rate volatility and oil prices volatility among nations has been studied through various approaches empirically. The existing literature falls into any of the following strands. Firstly, earlier studies applied aggregated trade data of a country to the remaining world. The results of these studies are mixed. Secondly, due to the problems of aggregation bias, later studies disaggregate data at the bilateral level. The second flow of recent studies took imports and exports separately to overcome the problem of aggregation bias: these studies disaggregate data not only at a country level but also at the industry level and in some cases even at the product level.\nMulti-scale risk connectedness between economic policy uncertainty of China and global oil prices in time\u2013frequency domains discussed the connection between exchange rate and oil price (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2022; Wang & Lee, 2020; Wei, 2019).\nFrom an econometric aspect, previous studies used various analysis techniques that recent research concluded to be inappropriate. These studies used methods that do not account for mixed integration cases. It is a known norm in the trade demand model that exchange rate volatility follows the stationary level I (0). The above-discussed issues lead to inappropriate discussions and misleading policy recommendations.\nDue to mixed and inappropriate findings of previous studies, research papers used disaggregated trade data for each trading partner and industry level to conclude more accurate results and policy recommendations for each trading partner and industry. An interesting research paper in the panel framework compared the effects of exchange rate volatility on international trade flows of developed and developing countries. The study concludes that exports of developing economies are more sensitive to the volatility of the exchange rate. More precisely studies (Norouzi et\u00a0al., 2020; Ramelli & Wagner, 2020; Salisu & Akanni, 2020) concentrate on ASEAN and conclude that exchange rate volatility results in the decline of international trade flows.\nThe main hypothesis is that the significant spillover effect between Brent oil prices and currency rates, key values of the F-test and p-value exists between 12 different national currencies of main oil exporting countries: Saudi Arabian Riyal, Iraqi dinar, UAE dirham, Kuwaiti dinar, Iranian dinar, Algerian Dinar, Nigerian Naira, Russian Ruble, US dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Brazil real and Brent Oil prices for the period from 2001 to 2021 (Mazur et\u00a0al., 2021; Narayan, 2020; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2021).\n309\nIntegrated decision recommendation system using\u2026"

Moreover, the research paper examines Brent Oil prices for the period from 2001 to 2021. For further analysis, the paper uses daily returns with the 1-step rolling window correlation coefficient. Like in previous research, the length of rolling window is about 36\u00a0months (Szczygielski et\u00a0 al., 2021; Wen et\u00a0 al., 2021). Table\u00a0 1 shows top oil producing countries. Most of OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) do not have a free-floating national currency, specifically: Saudi Arabian Riyal,\n310 A.\u00a0Mikhaylov et al.\n1 3\nIraqi dinar, UAE dirham, Kuwaiti dinar, Iranian dinar. These currencies link to USD. Therefore, the paper does not include these currencies into analyses.\nThe paper uses several methods for analyzing correlation and regression in order to investigate the spillover effect between oil prices and foreign exchange rates of national currencies (Russian Ruble, EURUSD, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Brazil real, Nigerian naira, Algerian dinar as large oil exporters). Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression models are the most suitable for this purpose. Many previous articles used the determination coefficient:\nMoreover, the analysis includes F-statistics for linear regression equations and its significance:\nMany authors used the t-test for Pearson correlation for such data:\nwhere TSS is the total sum of squares, RSS is the sum of squared residuals, ESS is the explained sum of squares, n is the number of observations, k is the number of explanatory variables, r is the correlation coefficient for this data, is the level of significance.\nThe study also conducts the Daily Returns Analysis of Currency rates in the data set.

The current paper implements the VAR model for finding the mean spillover between Brent oil prices and national currencies\u2019 volatilities. This is the bivariate VAR model for Brent oil volatility and national currencies\u2019 rates (Russian Ruble, EURUSD, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Brazil real, Nigerian naira, and Algerian dinar):\nwhere ro t , rv t are the logarithmic returns of Brent oil volatility and national currencies\u2019 rates (Russian Ruble, EURUSD, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Brazil real, Nigerian naira, and Algerian dinar), \u03bco and \u03bcv are the respective conditional mean series.

It was also \u2212 0.22 for the period from March 2020, which is explained of the COVID-19 pandemic spread.

It does not illustrate any significant pattern of a spillover effect between national currency exchange rates in Algeria (Fig.\u00a011).\nAlso, in the same period the correlation between Brent oil prices and national currencies rates of Nigeria is flexible as well. It does not illustrate any significant pattern of a spillover effect between national currency exchange rates in Nigeria (Fig.\u00a012).\nFor the last year correlation parameters became weaker, as the coefficient fluctuates between \u2212\u00a00.5 and 0.5. However, the spillover effect is more significant (in the range from \u2212\u00a00.8 to \u2212\u00a00.1) before 2020. Nigerian Naira and Algerian Dinar\nwere showing nearly the same movements, while the Russian Ruble was in a different corridor.

This article confirms the thesis that the volatility and profitability of assets constantly change synchronously over time. Volatility shocks can lead to shifts in investor behavior and create side effects in the short term.

Therefore, vulnerability to external shocks from developed markets is increasing (Norouzi et\u00a0al., 2020; Ramelli & Wagner, 2020; Salisu & Akanni, 2020; Szczygielski et\u00a0al., 2021; Wen et\u00a0al., 2021; Mazur et\u00a0al., 2021; Narayan, 2020; Nguyen et\u00a0al., 2021; Fang et\u00a0al., 2021; Szczygielski et\u00a0al., 2021; Wen et\u00a0al., 2021).\nThis model allows to measure the correlation coefficient to identify the joint movement of a group of markets. You can also determine the strength of the relationship between the profitability of the currencies of oil-producing countries and oil prices. The impact of volatility is considered both in the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods using daily price fluctuations. All three recent shocks (2008, 2012, 2020) in the oil market are transmitted to the currency markets of oil-producing countries. At the same time, the latest shock of 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been fully transmitted to the Russian ruble exchange rate. The main reason for this is the factor of reducing the sanctions pressure and the low level of external public debt in Russia.\n330 A.\u00a0Mikhaylov et al.\n1 3\nMany researchers have identified a strong increase in the correlations between oil prices and the yield of the currencies of oil-producing countries over the past two decades. The points of shocks to the volatility of national currencies coincide with sharp fluctuations in oil prices. This confirms the findings, which also revealed a large financial dependence on the United States for Brazil and the Russian national currency during the global economic crisis (Vo, 2011; Wen et\u00a0 al., 2019; Whaley, 2000).\nDespite the growing global focus on oil prices, relevant empirical research on spillovers remains surprisingly limited, confirming the need for further analysis. For example, correlations between national currencies of oil-producing countries are usually estimated using a variance\u2013covariance matrix, which cannot estimate the direction and intensity of side effects over time. Understanding the direction of spillovers is important for developing optimal portfolio and risk management strategies, including hedging practices, and providing policy makers with information about potential cross-country sources of business fluctuations (Ahmad et\u00a0al., 2018).\nMany studies have extensively used the financial markets and asset classes spillover index method to measure the magnitude and direction of spillover effects (Maghyereh et\u00a0al., 2016; Nadal et\u00a0al., 2017; Sarwar et\u00a0al., 2019).\nThis article fills in the gap in the body of knowledge, as its results better reflect the dynamic interactions between oil prices and currencies. For example, daily stock data causes non-synchronous trading day offsets and the impact of liquidity on the stock price, while monthly data cannot identify the transmission of volatility due to time aggregation offsets and offsetting effects.\nThus, the financial crises have increased the contagion effect between the oil market and the currency markets of oil-producing countries. Other studies show similar results in stock markets, as well as between commodity and currency markets.\nFor the pre-crisis period, it was assumed that financial uncertainty has a negative impact on both returns and the side effects of volatility, indicating that risk aversion by investors may have reduced the side effects in stock markets during this period.\n331\n1 3\nIntegrated decision recommendation system using\u2026\nTa bl\ne 21\nA\nve ra\nge v\nal ue\ns o f p\nos iti\nve a\nnd n\neg at\niv e\nm em\nbe rs\nhi p\nan d\nno n-\nm em\nbe rs\nhi p\nde gr\nee s f\nor th\ne pe\nrio ds\nD 1\nD 2\nD 3\nD 4\nPo si\ntiv e\nD eg\nre es\nN eg\nat iv\ne D\neg re\nes Po\nsi tiv\ne D\neg re\nes N\neg at\niv e\nD eg\nre es\nPo si\ntiv e\nD eg\nre es\nN eg\nat iv\ne D\neg re\nes Po\nsi tiv\ne D\neg re\nes N\neg at\niv e\nD eg\nre es\n\u03bc n\n\u03bc n\n\u03bc n\n\u03bc n\n\u03bc N\n\u03bc n\n\u03bc n\n\u03bc N\nP1 0.\n55 0.\n34 \u2212\n0. 45\n\u2212 0.\n28 0.\n53 0.\n33 \u2212\n0. 47\n\u2212 0.\n29 0.\n50 0.\n31 \u2212\n0. 50\n\u2212 0.\n31 0.\n54 0.\n33 \u2212\n0. 46\n\u2212 0. 28 P2 0. 55 0. 34 \u2212 0. 45 \u2212 0. 28 0. 52 0. 32 \u2212 0. 48 \u2212 0. 30 0. 49 0. 30 \u2212 0. 51 \u2212 0. 31 0. 52 0. 32 \u2212 0. 48 \u2212 0. 30 P3 0. 53 0. 32 \u2212 0. 48 \u2212 0. 29 0. 51 0. 31 \u2212 0. 49 \u2212 0. 30 0. 46 0. 28 \u2212 0. 54 \u2212 0. 33 0. 51 0. 31 \u2212 0. 49 \u2212 0. 30\n332 A.\u00a0Mikhaylov et al.\n1 3\nHowever, the dynamics of oil price volatility shows that along with the Brazilian stock market, the Russian stock market has recently begun to play an important role as a source of information transmission. The result confirms the payback hypothesis\n1 3\n(contagion effect), which assumes a decrease in the benefits of portfolio diversification in commodity markets during crisis periods. This finding is consistent with findings where a mixed portfolio of commodity assets provides reduced benefits through both improved diversification and reduced risk over these periods (Dutta et\u00a0al., 2017; Foroni et\u00a0al., 2017; Haugom et\u00a0al., 2014).\nThe oil market is always a transmitter of volatility, and the national currency markets of oil-producing countries become net consumers of investment in the post-crisis period. When predicting the exposure to portfolio market risks and determining whether the diversification benefits are available in the oil market, it is necessary to take into account the impact of side effects on the reduction of the diversification benefits, especially during periods of turmoil. In terms of asset allocation, the intensity of the side effects creates the need (or opportunity) to build a new diversification strategy. For example, portfolio investors in the markets can direct their funds to the oil market, which potentially reduces the risk of price declines in an environment of increased secondary investment intensity during periods of turmoil (Ji & Fan, 2016; Jin et\u00a0al., 2020; Joo & Park, 2017).\nFinally, in light of the interest in the impact of oil market volatility on macroeconomic indicators, identifying the presence, significance and changes in the net effects of volatility between the oil market and the currency markets of oil-producing countries offers directions for future research, which includes analyzing the impact of volatility in financial markets on real economic activity, understanding the significance of this volatility as sources of structural changes in the currency markets of oil-producing countries.\nSystematic risks are the most important risk type for the performance of oil markets. Systematic risk sources can be defined as market risk, political risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. These issues indicate the issues that investors cannot intervene on their own. Therefore, to increase the performance of oil markets, it is vital for countries to achieve economic stability first. In this context, country governments must first solve the high inflation problem and reduce the\nPeriods Net superior values Net Inferior values Overall values\nP1 0.699 \u2212 0.931 1.630 P2 0.245 0.920 \u2212 0.675 P3 \u2212 0.943 0.012 \u2212 0.955\n334 A.\u00a0Mikhaylov et al.\n1 3\nuncertainty in the market. In parallel, there should be no political risk in the country. In addition, factors that are important to the country\u2019s economy, such as interest rate and exchange rate, should not increase radically or decrease. In this way, it will be possible for countries to reach more efficient oil markets."

            "text": "Current trends in the structure of the currency market of oil-producing countries are created by the flow of volatility between national stock indices and the oil market. After the beginning of the pandemic crisis in 2020, the expectations of market participants began to correspond more to the hypothesis of rationality, in particular, the horizon of inflation expectations expanded, and the predictability of maintaining low interest rates in the world increased. In addition, the long-term trends include low inflation and a stimulating monetary policy.\nThe article reveals that the latest shock of 2020, caused by the covid-19 pandemic, has not yet been fully transmitted to the Russian ruble exchange rate. The main reason for this is the factor of reducing sanctions pressure and the low level of external public debt in Russia. For the last year correlation parameters became weaker, as the RURUSD correlation coefficient is fluctuating between \u2212 0.5 and 0.5. However, before 2020 the spillover effect is more significant (in the range from \u2212 0.8 to \u2212 0.1). Nigerian Naira and Algerian Dinar were showing almost the same movements, while Russian Ruble was in different corridor.\nThe managerial implications of the empirical results are including: the results can be useful in the formation of forecasts of asset prices and asset volatility by central banks. Some aspects outlined in the dissertation research can also be used in the activities of analytical departments of banks, investment funds and consulting companies. It can be integrated into the educational process of financial and economic universities.\nThe area for future research is in evaluating spillover effects on currency exchange rates in all oil exporting countries. Additionally, another evaluation is also performed regarding risk-based oil market spillovers in the global crisis periods with integrated decision recommendation systems. For this purpose, a fuzzy decision-making model is created by considering bipolar q-ROFSs, M-SWARA, ELECTRE and imputation of expert evaluations with collaborative filtering. It is defined that systematic risks are affected by currency rates and oil prices.\nThe major limitation is that: oil prices and systemic risks have an influence on each other. The findings also state that systematic risks have the greatest importance for oil market performance. Moreover, oil prices also play a key role in this situation. With respect to the ranking results of the periods, it is determined that the energy crisis between 2003 and 2009 is the most important period for the efficiency of the oil market performance.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions The problem is proposed by IMB.
