conclusions In this study, CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR quaternary biocomposites were successfully synthesized and physicochemical properties confirmed their properties. The results confirmed their safety and antibacterial activities under in vitro and in vivo conditions. This study showed that CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR nanosheets with photocatalytic performance could significantly expedite the infected wound healing process by decreasing total bacterial count, edema and the expression of TNF-α and also increasing angiogenesis, mature collagen synthesis and epithelization. CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR nanosheets can compete with standard ointment of mupirocin. Novelty is a strength point for this study and murine study is a major limitation that cannot be used for clinical uses in humans. materials and methods  materials Melamine (C3H4N6, 99%), methanol (ACS grade, 99%), and phosphate citrate buffer were prepared from Sigma Aldrich Company (Chemie, Steinheim, Germany).

Nitrogen gas was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The column temperature was programmed from 60 to 280 °C at an increasing rate of 10 °C/minute and kept at the initial and final temperatures for 2 min. Ionization method of EI with voltage ionization of 70 eV and ionization temperature of 240 °C was used. The extract was dissolved in methanol (1:100 ratio). The diluted sample of 1μL was injected into the GC column through a split injector (1:20 for 1 min) with a constant temperature of 250 °C. Compounds were identified by comparison of each mass spectra with those of pure reference compounds and confirmed using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mass spectra library provided by the Chemstation software (version E.02.00.493)23. synthesis of g‑c3n4 and zno/g‑c3n4 nanosheets To prepare g-C3N4, 10 g of melamine was added to a ceramic dish and heated at 550 °C (heating speed of 5 °C/ min) for four hours in an electric furnace (Azar Kiln Company, Made in Iran), after finishing the desired time. It was cooled at room temperature and the pale yellow powder was obtained18. Zinc acetate solution was prepared in deionized water, then it was sonicated pulse on 4 s–off 5 s for 15 min. NaOH solution was added to it under magnetic stirring at a rate of 10 ml/min and the sediments obtained were filtered, washed and dried at 100 °C for 5 h and finally powdered49. To synthesize the binary composite of ZnO/g-C3N4, 1 g of g-C3N4 powder was dispersed in 20 mL of methanol–water with a volume ratio of 1:1 for 30 min in the ultrasonic bath (Elma D-38687) and then 0.15 g of ZnO powder was added it and subjected to ultrasonic waves for 30 min. The suspension was Figure 12. (A) Immunofluorescence staining for expression of COL1A (red area); and (a) quantitative statistics based on COL1A staining on day 12 at wound sites, respectively.

The sediments were dried at 60–70 °C and then calcined at 300 °C in the electric furnace after collection by centrifuge50. synthesis of cmc/zno/g‑c3n4/myr 0.8 g of CMC was dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water at 60 °C. The amount of water was stabilized in a volume of 50 ml until a completely viscous and transparent solution was obtained. The soluble temperature slowly reached room temperature. One gram of the synthesized ZnO/g-C3N4 binary composite synthesized in the previous step was added to the CMC solution and was thoroughly mixed until the gel was obtained. A rest period of 24 h was considered for the above solution to all nanoparticles were entered into the polymer matrix. For the preparation of CMC/ZnO gel (without g-C3N4), pure zinc oxide (0.15 g) was added to the same CMC volume. To prepare CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR, the extract was inserted directly into CMC at a temperature of 35 °C and a 5% w/w ratio. ZnO/g-C3N4 was added after cooling. characterization The properties of synthesized CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 nanosheets were evaluated. Particle size was measured with the help of dynamic light distribution (DLS) using Malvern instrument UK. Measurements of nanoparticles at 25 °C and laser light exposure with wavelength of 657 nm were performed at room temperature and samples were prepared at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL and measured 3 times and each time for 30 s. To ensure ZnO doped on the hybrid, XRD of g-C3N4 was recorded at room temperature using X’ Pert Pro Panalytical diffraction, with Cu kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) and working voltage of 40 kV and 40 mA. To determine the bonds produced from the FT-IR spectrum (Spectrum Two model of PerkinElmer Company) was used to determine the shape and structure of the nano-hybrids of FE-SEM analysis (FESEM device of ZEISS Company of GermanySigma VP model Equipped with EDS detectors, Mapping, Oxford Instruments UK company). To determine the chemical composition of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCALAB-MKII spectrometer; VG Co., United Kingdom (equipped with X-ray al-Kα with eV 1486.6 energy and analysis of the results was used using SPD4.1 software considering carbon peak ((1 s) C) in eV284.2 bond energy. To determine the percentage of MyR concentration at any moment, its adsorption characteristics were used. For this purpose, appropriate concentrations of MyR were prepared in lukewarm water (0.25–0.01 mg/mL) and the sample absorption rate was obtained at 326 nm (maximum absorption based on the data obtained from the scan by spectrophotometer, model Ultrospec 2000, made in Scinteck, England). Then the calibration curve was plotted and its equation was determined (Y = 0.196x + 0.0635, R2 = 0.99). The release of MyR from the CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR was assessed in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) using the dialysis bag (sigma D0530 12000 k) diffusion technique, in a thermostatically controlled water bath shaker (Memmert, GmbH; Buchenbach, Germany). An amount equivalent to 10 mg of free MyR and CMC/ZnO/gC3N4/MyR were poured into a dialysis bag, and ends of the bag were closed, and it was immersed in a beaker containing 100 ml of release medium. The experiments were carried out at a temperature of 37 ± 1.0 °C for 48 h. The samples of 3 mL from the release medium were collected samples in time intervals and the absorbance was measured using the UV–visible spectrophotometer at 326 nm. Each withdrawn sample was replaced by an equal volume of the fresh release medium. antibacterial activity In vitro antibacterial activities of the nanosheets against pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa—ATCC 27853) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus—ATCC 25923) were assessed using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) as reported by others51. In summary, serial dilutions of nanosheets were prepared and placed in wells containing bacterial suspension (5 × 105 CFU/mL). The lowest concentrations of nanosheets that prevent growth and kill bacteria were considered MIC and MBC, respectively. toxicity Cytotoxicity evaluations were conducted with the help of NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells (104 cells/well) based on previous studies52,53. In summary, the cells were seeded in plates (104 cells/well) containing different concentrations of nanosheets and incubated for 24 h. Viability was assessed with the help of optical density at 492 nm. in vivo studies  experimental animals The healthy BALB/c male mice (n = 90) aged 10–11 weeks with a weight of 29 ± 2 g were prepared. The animals had unlimited access to water and food. They were kept under lab conditions prior to the start of study as the conditioning period. The mice were kept under a lighting diet of 12 h. This study lasted for 12 days in accordance with the Iranian ethical guidelines for the use of animals. All the used protocols, such as study design, sample size, randomization, outcome measures, data analysis, experimental procedures, and report of results, were in agreement with the ARRIVE guidelines. The protocols were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Veterinary Faculty and the Islamic Azad University Council on Animal Care, Tehran, Iran (IR. IAU. 1114/IAUUB.1401.09), and were in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH publication no.85-23, revised 1996). We declare that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. 14 Vol:.

A circular full-thickness wound was created with a diameter of 7 mm on the interscapular region of mice52,53. Following the induction of wound, an aliquot of 25 × 107 S. aureus and P. aeruginosa was suspended in 50-μL phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) and applied on the wound region of each mouse with the help of a 200-μL pipette. Following colonization, the animals (n = 90) were randomly grouped into five groups (n = 18) and treated with 0.5 g of soft paraffin (control), standard ointment of 2% mupirocin® (Mup group) and formulations containing CMC/ZnO, CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4 and CMC/ZnO/g-C3N4/MyR and each group was exposed to 660 nm UV-light for 10 min (light power is 0.8 W cm−2). It should be noted that each formulation was prepared as 2% (0.4 g of synthesized material in 20 g of soft paraffin). Wound contraction and total bacterial count in granulation tissue The wound contraction rate was assessed with the help of a transparent paper over the wound site and tracing it52,53. The total bacterial count was also measured with the help of plate count agar (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). In summary, 0.1 g of the wound sample was crushed, minced, and diluted and cultured on plate count agar. The cultured plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h and the total bacterial count was calculated. pathology results On days 3, 7 and 12, the samples were prepared from the wound site, fixed, processed, paraffin wax embedded, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin based on previous studies52,53. Edema, fibroblast, collagen and epithelization were investigated in 5 per high power fields with the help of two blinded pathologists who scored parameters in a range of 0–4 (0: Absence;1: small amount; 2: low; 3: high and 4: severe). immunofluorescent staining Immunofluorescence staining was used to evaluate the effects of nanosheets on the wound healing process and conducted as reported by others54,55. Following the processes of paraffin-embedding, dewaxing, rehydration and immersion into citrate buffer (pH 7.4) for 20 min, slides were washed with TBS plus 0.03% Triton X-100, blocked in 10% normal serum or with 1% BSA in TBS for 2 h at room temperature. The ratio of target protein-positive nuclei to DAPI-positive nuclei in 3 microscopic fields per group was used for quantification by ImageJ software. The samples were investigated for CD31, COLA1 and TNF-α on day 7. The used antibodies included CD31 (pecam1-E-AB-60608-Elabscience), TNF-α (ab6671, Abcam Biotechnology, Inc), and COLA1 (sc-293182; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc), Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (E-AB-1011, Elabscience Company) and Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (E-AB-1014, Elabscience Company). data analysis The data were analyzed for normality with the help of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test in SPSS software (version 23) and analyzed by one-way ANOVA because the data were normal. Duncan’s posthoc test was used to investigate differences between groups and P < 0.05 was significant. The data for pathological were not normal and analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis.
