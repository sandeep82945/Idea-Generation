 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Study production variability and model uncertainty in a wider range of NLG tasks beyond translation, simplification, storytelling, and dialogue. For example, examine summarization, question answering, image captioning. 

2. Develop new probing metrics beyond lexical, syntactic, and semantic distance to capture additional aspects of production variability, like information content, pragmatics, discourse structure.

3. Experiment with different model architectures, training techniques, and decoding algorithms to better calibrate model uncertainty to human production variability.

4. Collect multi-reference NLG datasets with more careful control over the annotation process to reduce potential biases in human production variability.

5. Extend the analysis to conditional text generation tasks where both the input and output exhibit variability, such as style transfer or controlled generation. Examine which aspects of variability are preserved or transformed.
