 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a similar study using incentivized choices to see if the results hold when real money is at stake. This could reveal if hypothetical bias is affecting the stated willingness to pay amounts.

2. Investigate how framing the risks and benefits of sharing personal data influences the stated value of protecting the data. For example, emphasize data sharing for medical research versus advertising. 

3. Explore willingness to accept compensation rather than willingness to pay for protection. Compare whether they imply different valuations for personal data privacy.

4. Look at additional personal data types beyond the 8 studied here, such as purchase history, biometric data, location over time, etc. See if they fall into the same tiers.

5. Conduct a study with a more representative sample to see if the results generalize beyond the educated, female-skewed sample here. Look at cultural and demographic differences.
