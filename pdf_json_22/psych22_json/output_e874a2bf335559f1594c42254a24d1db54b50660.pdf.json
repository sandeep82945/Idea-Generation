    "abstractText": "Although the factors influencing sexual health have been explored by researchers, the impact of leisure and personality on psychosexual adjustment and the interaction of these two factors remain unknown. This study investigated the relationship between leisure satisfaction and psychosexual adjustment based on the compensation theory and the social learning theory. The differences in psychosexual adjustment across different personality types were also explored. Finally, we examined the interaction between personality and leisure satisfaction based on the personal-environment fit models. The participants in this study were 1,161 college students. The results supported all the hypotheses proposed. There was a significant positive correlation between leisure satisfaction and psychosexual adjustment. Participants of four personality types (the overcontrolled, high-moderate, low-moderate, and resilient groups) had different performance in psychosexual adjustment. The resilient group had the highest scores, while the overcontrolled group had the lowest scores. The results suggest that there is an interaction between personality and leisure satisfaction. Our research could enrich the research contents of leisure and personality and provide a practical basis for the improvement of college students in psychosexual adjustment.",

This study investigated the relationship between leisure satisfaction and psychosexual adjustment based on the compensation theory and the social learning theory. The differences in psychosexual adjustment across different personality types were also explored. Finally, we\u00a0examined the interaction between personality and leisure satisfaction based on the personal-environment fit models. The participants in this study were 1,161 college students. The results supported all the hypotheses proposed. There was a significant positive correlation between leisure satisfaction and psychosexual adjustment. Participants of four personality types (the overcontrolled, high-moderate, low-moderate, and resilient groups) had different performance in psychosexual adjustment. The resilient group had the highest scores, while the overcontrolled group had the lowest scores. The results suggest that there is an interaction between personality and leisure satisfaction. Our research could enrich the research contents of leisure and personality and provide a practical basis for the improvement of college students in psychosexual adjustment.\nKeywords: personality, psychosexual adjustment, leisure satisfaction, latent profile analysis, college students\nINTRODUCTION\nPsychosexual adjustment is a psychological variables that affects sexual functioning, including thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and interpersonal relationships (Sprankle, 2015). When researchers investigate sexual functioning and sexual health, they mostly discuss them in terms of physiological aspects (Cherven et\u00a0 al., 2021). However, adolescents and young adults are accompanied by a series of psychosocial developments as well. In China, young people tend to be\u00a0 more openminded about sexuality along with social progress (Song, 2015). However, current inappropriate sex education runs counter to the trend toward openness among the youth. Consequently, many teenagers still have rigid attitudes about gender and sexuality as well as misconceptions about puberty and masturbation (Sa et\u00a0 al., 2021). This probably causes adolescents to have difficulty in adjusting. Especially after they enter college, as their scope of interpersonal communication expands, they may be\u00a0 confronted with the challenges of forming intimate relationships in\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 895411\npre-adulthood (Erikson, 1963), including issues related to psychosexual adjustment. In light of this situation, our study mainly focused on the psychosexual adjustment of college students.\nIn general, psychosexual adjustment can be\u00a0 divided into three domains: psychosexual selfhood (intrapersonal functioning such as body image and self-perception), psychosexual socialization (related to the interaction of the individuals with their social environment), and sexual/intimate behavior (sexualized behaviors and experiences; Dekker et\u00a0 al., 2017). Scholars also have measured psychosexual adjustment from 12 dimensions, including internal sexual control (individuals feel their sexual life under their control; Alley and Strassberg, 2020).\nPrevious studies have found that psychosexual adjustment is linked to stress (Arya et\u00a0 al., 2019), cancer and treatment (Barnett et\u00a0al., 2016; Rizzuto et\u00a0al., 2021), puberty development (Dwyer, 2020), leisure (Williams et\u00a0 al., 2020), and personality (Thompson et\u00a0 al., 2019; Hashemi, 2020), among which leisure is of great significance to everyone, especially college students who have plenty of free time (Das and Barman, 2019). In addition, the role of individual personality on sexual psychology has also been of interest (Fr\u00edas et\u00a0 al., 2017). As a result, our study focused on the relationship among leisure satisfaction, psychosexual adjustment, and personality."

            "text": "Leisure satisfaction refers to positive views or feelings obtained in leisure activities, which reflects the overall satisfaction degree of leisure experience (Beard and Ragheb, 1980). According to the compensation theory (Wilson, 1980), individuals can compensate for negative aspects in other areas of life through well-experienced leisure activities. Some hold that leisure satisfaction may even be\u00a0 more important than other sources of life satisfaction (Tokay Argan and Mersin, 2021). From an ecological perspective, both positive leisure activities and consequent flow experiences (wonderful experiences of being fully involved in the present moment) not only can help prevent problematic behaviors such as aggression (Park et\u00a0 al., 2017) and substance use (Santini et\u00a0 al., 2020) among young people but also promote their development and adjustment (Mahoney et\u00a0 al., 2009; Freire and Teixeira, 2018). Specifically, excellent leisure experience is associated with a clear sense of self-identity (Mansfield et\u00a0 al., 2020), the formation of social relationships (Kim et\u00a0 al., 2016a), and relief from stress (Chun et\u00a0 al., 2021). All these factors are conducive to the development of psychosexual adjustment (Bigras et\u00a0al., 2015; Kim and Jang, 2020). Considering leisure is a kind of social construction, Bandura\u2019s social learning theory (Bandura and Walters, 1977) can provide us insights into the understanding of how people promote their psychosexual adjustment through leisure activities. Positive participation and meaningful experience in leisure activities allow the youth to learn how to socialize properly (Granzin and Haggard, 2000) and gain interpersonal support and confidence (Kim et\u00a0 al., 2016b), which have an important impact on their psychosexual adjustment (Parchomiuk, 2019; Barrada and Castro, 2020).\nIn contrast, a lack of pleasure in leisure seems to be\u00a0associated with an unhealthy status. For example, leisure boredom could help predict substance use and Internet use in adolescents (Weybright et\u00a0 al., 2015; Wang, 2019). In the field of sexual psychology, studies have shown a correlation between leisure boredom and adolescent risky sexual behaviors (Miller et\u00a0 al., 2014). Based on these facts, we\u00a0 proposed the following first hypothesis:\nH1: Leisure satisfaction is positively correlated with psychosexual adjustment."

            "text": "Personality is a mode of thinking, feeling and behaving that help to differentiate people from each other. It affects a person\u2019s response to all kinds of situations (Caspi, 1998). Personality is relatively stable throughout life even during adolescence, fluctuating only within a certain range (Brown and Prinstein, 2011). The five-factor model of personality (Van Leeuwen et\u00a0al., 2004) is one of the most widely used trait models with high reliability and validity at different developmental stages of the life cycle (De Clercq et\u00a0 al., 2009). It measures personality from five dimensions: extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism (also known as emotional stability). However, individuals are usually affected by different trait dimensions simultaneously (Atkins and Hart, 2008). According to the five-factor model, some studies have confirmed that the personality structure can be\u00a0 divided into four classes: the moderate, protected, vulnerable, and undercontrolled groups (De Clercq et\u00a0 al., 2012) or into three classes: the resilient, undercontrolled, and overcontrolled groups (Zhang et\u00a0al., 2015). In a longitudinal study of Finnish adults, the researchers identified five personality types: the resilient, overcontrolled, undercontrolled, reserved, and ordinary groups (Kinnunen et\u00a0 al., 2012). Overall, resilient/protected individuals typically have low neuroticism and high levels of the other four dimensions. Overcontrolled/vulnerable individuals are exactly the opposite, with high neuroticism and low levels of the other dimensions. Undercontrolled individuals are characterized by low conscientiousness, slightly high neuroticism, and high openness and extraversion (Zhang et\u00a0 al., 2015). Reserved people usually have low openness. Moreover, all personality traits of moderate/ ordinary individuals are at the middle levels (Kinnunen et\u00a0 al., 2012).\nAs a typical individual difference variable, the role of personality on sexual psychology and behavior has also been widely studied. Eysenck and Wilson (1976) suggested that extroverts are thrill seekers, while neurotic people do not enjoy sexual behavior as much because they are extremely tense. Moreover, extraversion is positively correlated with sexting, while agreeableness and emotional stability are negatively correlated (Delevi and Weisskirch, 2013). Openness is negatively correlated with sexual prejudice, for people who are higher in openness are more likely to accept social changes (Miller et\u00a0 al., 2012). Furthermore, personality types and personality disorders caused by the mixture of multiple personality traits\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 895411\nare also related to psychosexual adjustment. Children of the undercontrolled type are more likely to have sex before the age of 16 (Atkins and Hart, 2008). Women with borderline personality disorder have been found to have chaotic relationships and more sexual partners in a short period of time (Thompson et\u00a0 al., 2019). However, previous studies on the influence of personality on psychosexual health have mostly focused on unhealthy sexuality and morbid personality and have not explored the normal groups. Therefore, we\u00a0 proposed the second hypothesis:\nH2: Psychosexual adjustment differs across different personality types."

            "text": "There is an interaction between personality traits and leisure satisfaction. Scholars generally hold that leisure has a profound and unique reflection on our personality (Munusturlar and Argan, 2016). Furthermore, the relationship between personality and leisure satisfaction has physiological basis. Eysenck and Wilson (1976) suggested that extroverts have high cortical inhibition and low baseline arousal, which causes them to seek external stimulation. Introverts, on the other hand, have a low arousal threshold and need less stimulation to maintain optimal levels. People with lower emotional stability are less playful and get less enjoyment from social activities (Lepp et\u00a0al., 2015). Additionally, people of neuroticism may feel unfulfilled in leisure and be\u00a0 less cheerful than other personality types (Codish and Ravid, 2015). People of the traditional type of personality can obtain higher educational satisfaction in leisure than the investigative,\nenterprising, realistic, and artistic types. They score higher on social satisfaction than the enterprising type as well (Park, 2009).\nWe have found the relationship between leisure satisfaction and psychosexual adjustment as well as the relationship between personality and psychosexual adjustment. However, as far as we\u00a0 know, no one has investigated the relationship among these three variables. Under the theoretical framework of personalenvironment fit models (Iso-Ahola and Weissinger, 1990), studies conducted have proved that the overcontrolled adolescent maladaptive behavior (such as criminal behavior) is a strategy to buffer leisure boredom (Spaeth et\u00a0 al., 2015). Moreover, it has been shown that there is an interaction between leisure satisfaction and personality on subjective well-being (Liu, 2014). Based on the research mentioned above, we\u00a0 proposed the third hypothesis:\nH3: Leisure satisfaction and personality have an interactive effect on psychosexual adjustment.\nIn general, this study aims to explore the relationship between leisure satisfaction and psychosexual adjustment based on the compensation theory and the social learning theory. We\u00a0 also explored the differences in the psychosexual adjustment across different personality types. Furthermore, we\u00a0 examined the moderating effect of personality types between leisure satisfaction and psychosexual adjustment. We\u00a0 propose the following three hypotheses: H1: Leisure satisfaction is positively correlated with psychosexual adjustment. H2: Psychosexual adjustment differs across different personality types. H3: Leisure satisfaction and personality have an interactive effect on psychosexual adjustment. The theoretical model is shown in Figure\u00a0 1.\nFIGURE\u00a01 | The moderation model used in this study.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 895411"

The results are shown in Table\u00a0 2.\nTable\u00a0 2 contains the AIC, BIC, ABIC, entropy, and LMR statistics for each of the tested models. An optimal model fit is defined by lower AIC, BIC, and ABIC values (Finch, 2015). For all models, these three values decreased as the number of profiles increased from 1 to 5, providing support for the 5-profile solution. If the LMR value of model K reached the significance level (p < 0.05), it indicated that model K had a higher variance explanation rate than model K-1. According to the model fitting results in Table\u00a0 2, the LMR values of the 2-profile model, 3-profile model and 4-profile model all reached the level of significance, showing that these three models were superior to the 5-profile solution. Furthermore, there was little difference in the index between the 4-profile model and the 5-profile model. Therefore, we\u00a0 preferred the 4-profile solution. Entropy represents classification accuracy, which generally has a high standard of 0.80 (Clark, 2010). Ultimately, the 4-profile model was chosen as the optimal latent profile analysis model.\nTable\u00a0 3 shows the Z scores of five personality traits for each personality profile. The overcontrolled group has higher neuroticism but lower scores in the other four dimensions, and Profile 1 matched these features. Profile 4 conformed to the definition of the resilient group, showing the lowest level of neuroticism and higher levels of the other four dimensions. All personality dimensions of Profile 2 and Profile 3 were almost at the average level. The only difference was that the scores of Profile 2 were slightly lower than those of Profile 3. Therefore, Profile 2 and Profile 3 were identified as typical personality types, with Profile 2 named the low-moderate group and Profile 3 named the high-moderate group."

Among the four personality types, we\u00a0 selected the overcontrolled group as the reference group. Three dummy codes were used for the highmoderate group, the low-moderate group, and the resilient group. To reduce the collinearity between variables, we\u00a0 standardized the independent variable (leisure satisfaction) first. After that, the interaction term was calculated between the standardized independent variable and the moderating variable (personality types). Leisure satisfaction was put into the first layer. Then, dummy codes of the moderating variable were added to the second layer. Finally, the interaction terms were added into the regression equation as the third level. The results show that the interaction of the leisure satisfaction and the dummy variable for the high-moderate group, the low-moderate group, and the resilient group was all statistically significant, with p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.011, respectively, as shown in Table\u00a0 5.\nTo further explore the moderating effects of personality, we\u00a0 divided participants into two groups: a low leisure satisfaction group (scored one standard deviation below the average) and a high leisure satisfaction group (scored one standard deviation above the average). Figure\u00a03 illustrates the moderating effects of personality. For the accurate demonstration of the moderating effects of each personality type, a linear regression model test was conducted for each group and the path coefficients were 0.24 for the overcontrolled group (t = 1.74, p = 0.089), 0.22 for the high-moderate group (t = 4.28, p < 0.001), 0.30 for the low-moderate group (t = 7.75, p < 0.001), and 0.47 for the resilient group (t = 3.49, p = 0.001)."

            "text": "As expected, the results confirmed a link between leisure satisfaction and psychosexual adjustment. Consistent with previous research (Zerengok et\u00a0al., 2018), when college students actively participated in leisure activities, they showed progress in social adjustment and reported psychological and physical benefits. This result can be\u00a0 interpreted based on social learning theory. People learn communication skills and norms, and learn to understand themselves and others appropriately through entertainment on informal occasions. Individuals could derive pleasure and social benefits from interpersonal interactions in leisure activities (Chao, 2013). In other words, positive leisure can enable people to achieve psychosexual socialization (Shin and You, 2013). Apart from this, leisure is regarded as a potential resource for people in dealing with some forms of stigma such as sexual orientation (Mock et\u00a0al., 2013). Leisure could provide sexual minorities with a sense of belonging which brings benefits to their psychosexual selfhood, but this requires favorable social\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 895411\nand relaxing conditions (Outley and McKenzie, 2007; Jones and McCarthy, 2010). As previous research has found, engaging in meaningful social leisure activities can positively impact current and future mental health (Timonen et\u00a0 al., 2021). Based on the compensation theory, positive experience in leisure seems to be\u00a0 a powerful source of self-control efficacy (Stebbins, 2006). Due to the lack of leisure resources and opportunities, bored young people may turn to risky activities (Sharp et\u00a0 al., 2011). Leisure interventions that can change the leisure cognition of teenagers and help improve their leisure satisfaction, such as HealthWise (Motamedi et\u00a0 al., 2020), have been shown having the potential to reduce the likelihood of early sexual activity in boys.\nAmong all the relationships between leisure satisfaction and psychosexual adjustment, the relationship between contact satisfaction and self-adjustment was the strongest. One explanation is that self-esteem can be\u00a0 gained from social support (Erango and Ayka, 2015). When people get along well with others and receive positive feedback about themselves from others, they can improve their self-acceptance concerning physiology and psychology. This finding was also expressed by Cooley\u2019s conception of the \u201clooking-glass self\u201d (Cooley, 1902), in which the actor constantly builds his self-image based on the reactions of others to his performances. Similarly, social interaction has explained more than half of the association between green space use and self-satisfaction (Dadvand et\u00a0 al., 2019)."

This result may, in part, be\u00a0explained by the stricter control of Chinese parents over teenagers and the corresponding more reserved qualities teenagers have (Ho, 1994; Wang et\u00a0 al., 2018).\nThe hierarchical linear models seem to indicate that the overcontrolled group was at a disadvantage in all dimensions of psychosexual adjustment compared with other groups. Only in the sex control dimension was there no significant difference between the overcontrolled group and the low-moderate group. The overcontrolled group scored relatively low in the dimension of extraversion and relatively high in neuroticism, showing inflexibility in cognition and behavior and high attention to detail processing (Gilbert et\u00a0 al., 2020). Besides, the overcontrolled group is usually associated with a higher likelihood of internalizing problems (Asendorpf et\u00a0 al., 2001). This situation is mainly due to the fact that overcontrolled individuals may have more difficulty participating in social activities or engaging fully in intimate relationships (Denissen et\u00a0al., 2008). Nevertheless, this situation also entails that such individuals have a higher degree of control than undercontrolled people (Block and Block, 1980).\nThis fact may explain why the overcontrolled group did not differ from the low-moderate group in sexual control.\nThe resilient group, the opposite of the overcontrolled group, showed an advantage across all dimensions. Adolescence is a time when young people can sort out their sexual identities and sexual orientation (Katz-Wise, 2015). Meanwhile, in this phase the youth might worry about their sexual attractiveness. Individuals in the resilient group excel at this stage because they are able to adapt to a variety of environmental needs (Asendorpf, 2006). Specifically, higher levels of resilience are associated with higher levels of self-acceptance and self-control (Baeva et\u00a0 al., 2016), both of which contribute to the development of psychosexual adjustment (Woodford et\u00a0 al., 2014; Magnusson et\u00a0 al., 2019).\nComparing Profiles 2 and 3, both of which were considered moderate, we\u00a0 found that the former profile performed better in psychosexual adjustment. But overall, they scored in the middle in psychosexual adjustment. Consistent with previous findings (Rettew et\u00a0 al., 2008), individuals with moderate characteristics belong to a stable class. They do not pursue stimulating experience too excessively and have a certain degree of self-protection. In addition, more agreeable and more open individuals may have\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 895411\ngreater psychological and physiological adjustment (Boyce and Wood, 2011; \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in et\u00a0 al., 2018)."

The moderating effects of all personality types were positive, and the moderating effect of the resilient group was the most prominent. These results confirmed the applicability of personal-environment fit models to adolescent psychosexual adjustment. As a risk-protective factor, resilience can promote positive development during times of adversity (Luthar et\u00a0 al., 2000). In high-risk family settings, resilient youth are 3.5 times more likely to be\u00a0 free of health problems throughout their lifetime than their peers with low resilience (Hopkins et\u00a0 al., 2015). The moderating effects of the remaining personality types were also positive, but not as good as that of the resilience group. Moreover, it is worth emphasizing that leisure satisfaction seems to make a major contribution to the existence of a moderating effect. This further suggests that adolescents of different types could benefit from well-experienced leisure (Bradley and Inglis, 2012)."

For example, to a certain extent,\nmore decent and more socially compliant interactions with others mean higher levels of contact satisfaction in leisure. Accordingly, we\u00a0may need longitudinal studies to explore deeply the relationship between these two. In addition, there were certain geographical limitations concerning our research participants. Geographical differences could lead to huge differences in economic conditions, lifestyles, and ultimately differences in characteristics. Furthermore, we\u00a0did not find the undercontrolled group and the reserved group in our study. Instead, we\u00a0 found that the moderate group could be\u00a0divided into two types, which is different from previous studies. This is also one of the limitations of our research. For an accurate study of personality types, the sampling scope of participants may be\u00a0 expanded. Finally, gender is also a point of interest for our future research, for personality and gender may have mixed effects on psychosexual adjustment. If this variable had been added, our research could be\u00a0 more enriched."
