    "abstractText": "A Coulomb blockaded M -Majorana island coupled to normal metal leads realizes a novel type of Kondo effect where the effective impurity \u201cspin\u201d transforms under the orthogonal group SO(M). The impurity spin stems from the non-local topological ground state degeneracy of the island and thus the effect is known as the topological Kondo effect. We introduce a physically motivated N -channel generalization of the topological Kondo model. Starting from the simplest case N = 2, we conjecture a stable intermediate coupling fixed point and evaluate the resulting low-temperature impurity entropy. The impurity entropy indicates that an emergent Fibonacci anyon can be realized in the N = 2 model. We also map the case N = 2, M = 4 to the conventional 4-channel Kondo model and find the conductance at the intermediate fixed point. By using the perturbative renormalization group, we also analyze the large-N limit, where the fixed point moves to weak coupling. In the isotropic limit, we find an intermediate stable fixed point, which is stable to \u201cexchange\u201d coupling anisotropies, but unstable to channel anisotropy. We evaluate the fixed point impurity entropy and conductance to obtain experimentally observable signatures of our results. In the large-N limit we evaluate the full cross over function describing the temperature-dependent conductance.",

The impurity spin stems from the non-local topological ground state degeneracy of the island and thus the effect is known as the topological Kondo effect. We introduce a physically motivated N -channel generalization of the topological Kondo model. Starting from the simplest case N = 2, we conjecture a stable intermediate coupling fixed point and evaluate the resulting low-temperature impurity entropy. The impurity entropy indicates that an emergent Fibonacci anyon can be realized in the N = 2 model. We also map the case N = 2, M = 4 to the conventional 4-channel Kondo model and find the conductance at the intermediate fixed point. By using the perturbative renormalization group, we also analyze the large-N limit, where the fixed point moves to weak coupling. In the isotropic limit, we find an intermediate stable fixed point, which is stable to \u201cexchange\u201d coupling anisotropies, but unstable to channel anisotropy. We evaluate the fixed point impurity entropy and conductance to obtain experimentally observable signatures of our results. In the large-N limit we evaluate the full cross over function describing the temperature-dependent conductance.\nIntroduction. Since the original Kondo model of a magnetic impurity screened by a single orbital in a metal [1], its multichannel generalization [2], especially in mesoscopic devices [3, 4], has proven to be a fruitful system exemplifying exotic many-body phenomena [5\u201310] such as emergent anyonic excitations [11\u201314] even in the simplest two-channel Kondo (2CK) model [15, 16]. The key parameters that determine the behavior of the system are the spin of the impurity (S) and the largest possible total spin (N/2) for N channels of conduction electrons. When N > 2S, namely the overscreened case [2], the low-temperature fixed point is at intermediate coupling strength, with both weak and strong coupling fixed points unstable. Notably, in the limit of large N , the intermediate coupling fixed point moves toward weak coupling and becomes perturbatively accessible in 1/N expansion [2, 17].\nThe intermediate coupling fixed point cannot generically be described by a Fermi liquid theory. For example, in a mesoscopic 2CK device, the conductance correction near T = 0 is proportional to T [7, 9], and not to T 2 expected of a Fermi liquid [18]. Besides the conductance, the impurity entropy also shows exotic non-integer quantum dimension, which can be interpreted as a fractional ground state degeneracy. As shown by Emery and Kivelson [15] (see also Refs. [16, 19, 20]), an emergent Majorana will remain of the impurity spin after the screening by conduction electrons. The low-temperature impurity entropy is given by ln \u221a 2 where \u221a 2 is the quantum dimension of a single Majorana (two uncoupled Majoranas have a ground state degeneracy 2). For 3CK, the screened impurity entropy is ln\u03d5, where \u03d5 = (1 + \u221a 5)/2 is the Golden ratio [21, 22], exhibiting the quantum dimension of a Fibonacci anyon. The conventional multichannel Kondo (MCK) models based on the SU(2) symmetry group (which is natural in the case of a magnetic impurity) have been extensively studied by using conformal field theory (CFT) [5, 23\u201330] and various other methods [17, 31\u201340].\nIt is natural to expect that the rich physics of the multi-\nchannel Kondo effect can be further expanded by considering symmetry groups beyond the conventional SU(2). Recently, Be\u0301ri et al. [41, 42] showed that a Coulomb blockaded topological superconductor hosting M Majorana zero modes coupled to M normal metal leads displays a Kondo interaction with SO(M) symmetry [43]. Even though this \u201ctopological Kondo\u201d model has only one SO(M) channel [44], in certain cases (such as M = 3, 4) it can be mapped to an SU(2) MCK model and therefore has non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior at low temperatures. For example, the conductance correction near T = 0 is proportional to T 2(M\u22122)/M and the impurity entropy generically indicates a fractional ground state degeneracy [45]. With the SO(M) symmetry group providing a relatively stable NFL fixed point, the single-channel topological Kondo model has attracted a wide range of detailed studies and extensions [46\u201357]. However, the multichannel version of it has not yet been studied.\nIn this paper, we generalize the topological Kondo model to N \u2265 2 channels and propose a physical realization for it. Already in the relatively simple N = 2, M = 8 case we find a quantum dimension indicating an emergent Fibonacci anyon which cannot be realized for any M in the single channel SO(M) model. In this simplest 2-channel generalization, we also find a mapping between SO(4) and conventional 4CK model, allowing us to find the exact fractional fixed point conductance, Eq. (2). In order to study a more general case, we then introduce large-N perturbation theory similar to what has been done with the SU(2) case [36, 58, 59]. We focus on the experimentally relevant observables of the conductance [7, 9, 60] and impurity entropy [22, 61\u201365].\nTwo-channel topological Kondo model. The two-channel generalization of the isotropic topological Kondo interaction Hamiltonian is\nHK = \u03bb1S \u00b7 J1(x0) + \u03bb2S \u00b7 J2(x0), (1)\nwhere S(\u03b1,\u03b2) = \u2212i\u03b3\u03b1\u03b3\u03b2/2 and J (\u03b1,\u03b2)i = \u2212i(\u03c8 \u2020 i,\u03b1\u03c8i,\u03b2 \u2212\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n10 10\n5v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 1\n2 Ja\nn 20\n23\n2\n\u03c8\u2020i,\u03b2\u03c8i,\u03b1) are, respectively, the impurity and conduction electron \u201cspin\u201d operators that satisfy the SO(M) algebra; the vectors S and J are formed of M(M \u22121)/2 components labeled by (\u03b1, \u03b2) with \u03b1 6= \u03b2 taking values from 1 to M . The interaction (1) arises from a tunneling Hamiltonian\u2211 i,\u03b1 t i \u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03c8 \u2020 i,\u03b1(x0) + h.c. between the normal metal leads (fermion operators \u03c8i,\u03b1) and the Coulomb blockaded Majorana island (Majorana operators \u03b3\u03b1) with tunneling amplitudes ti\u03b1 (which for simplicity we take to be real) and can be realized in the setup depicted in Fig. 1a. We connect each Majorana of the island to two leads, labeled i = 1, 2, which we call channels. The M sub-channels in each channel (which is also the number of Majoranas) are dubbed different flavors, labeled by \u03b1. In order to prevent tunneling from mixing different channels, we have added a charging energy Ec2 for the second channel. Thus the i = 2 \u201clead\u201d should be considered as a large quantum dot with small level spacing but significant charging energy in full analogy with the proposal of Ref. [60], used to implement the 2CK effect in quantum dots. In the weak-tunneling limit, the effective exchange interaction strength is then \u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2 \u221d ti\u03b1ti\u03b2/Ui where Ui is the charging energy.\nWe will first focus on 2-channel SO(4) topological Kondo model which can be exactly mapped to 4CK. The reason is that we can consider SO(M = 4) as two independent \u201cspins\u201d, i.e. SO(4) \u223c SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) which allows us to unitarily transform \u03c8i,\u03b1 (with channel index i = 1, 2 and flavor index \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3, 4) to \u03c8n,\u03c3 (n = 1, 2, 3, 4; \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193) [66]. Likewise, with the total charge of the Majorana island fixed, one can form a single SU(2) spin-1/2 out of the four Majorana operators \u03b3\u03b1. Thus, we have an overscreened Kondo problem which makes the strong coupling fixed point unstable [2] and we expect a stable intermediate coupling fixed point in the isotropic case where we take \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 in Eq. (1).\nOverscreening implies the NFL behavior. In order to probe the NFL nature of this low-temperature fixed point, one can measure the fixed point conductance at T = 0. Due to the charging energy of other channels except the channel i = 1, we define the conductance matrix [47] G\u03b1,\u03b2 in the first chan-\nnel as the charge current in (flavor) lead \u03b1 as a linear response to weak voltage V\u03b2 \u2192 0 applied to lead \u03b2, i.e., G\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u3008I\u03b1\u3009/V\u03b2 . We expect a nonzero fixed point conductance and the corresponding correction to conductance near T = 0 will be T (M\u22122)/(M+2) based on our large-N results and the scaling dimension of the leading irrelevant operator in the CFT [21, 24\u201326], see discussion below Eq. (8). For example, when N = 2 and M = 4, we expect\nG\u03b16=\u03b2(T ) = e2\n4h\n[ 1 + c\u03b1\u03b2 ( T\nTK\n)1/3] . (2)\nThe dimensionless coefficients c\u03b1\u03b2 (of order one) and the Kondo temperature TK are not predicted by the CFT method. We used the fact that the 2-channel SO(4) topological Kondo model can be mapped to the 4CK model after fixing the parity [66], see also Eq. (9). The nontrivial fractional power of the temperature dependence signifies the NFL behavior at low temperatures.\nAnother observable that also shows NFL behavior is the impurity entropy at the fixed point. It is given by Simp = ln g where g is usually interpreted as ground state degeneracy. The N = 1 topological Kondo was shown to have g = \u221a M for\nodd M and g = \u221a M/2 for even M by Altland et al. [45]. Even though the 1-channel impurity entropy shows nontrivial result, the N = 2 case is even more complex:\ng =\n{ 1 2 \u221a M + 2/ cos [ \u03c0M 2(M+2) ] , M is odd,\n1 2\n\u221a (M + 2)/2/ cos [ \u03c0M\n2(M+2)\n] , M is even.\n(3)\nAgain, the impurity entropy of 2-channel SO(4) topological Kondo from Eq. (3) is ln \u221a 3 which is the same as the impurity entropy of 4CK [5, 21, 67] and exhibits the quantum dimension \u221a 3 of a Z3 parafermion [68]. Interestingly, 2-channel SO(8) has g = 2 +\u03d5, which indicates an emergent Fibonacci anyon (similar to 3CK). Both of the above two observables at this fixed point show fractional values, which are beyond Fermi liquid description and indicate emergent anyonic excitations. We point out that for a fixed M , the impurity entropy and g are larger in the 2-channel case as compared to N = 1. Indeed, g approaches monotonically the degeneracy ofM free Majoranas in the large-N limit, see Eq. (10) below.\nThe charging energy Ec2 is essential for the multichannel topological Kondo. Otherwise, when Ec2 = 0, the interaction couples only to a single effective channel with a fermion operator \u03c8\u0303\u03b1(x0) = \u2211 i(t i \u03b1/ \u2223\u2223~t\u03b1\u2223\u2223)\u03c8i,\u03b1(x0) and reduces to the conventional N = 1 topological Kondo Hamiltonian; When Ec2 6= 0 with fine-tuned \u03bb1 = \u03bb2, we will have an intermediate coupling fixed point. In the case \u03bb1 6= \u03bb2, based on our large-N calculations discussed below, we expect that the weaker coupling renormalizes to zero and the single-channel limit is recovered. N 1: layered construction. Next, we generalize the Hamiltonian (1) to N channels. Without exchange isotropy, the interaction becomes\nHK = N\u2211 i=1 M\u2211 \u03b1<\u03b2=2 \u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2S (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u00b7 J (\u03b1,\u03b2)i (x0). (4)\n3\nThe coupling constant \u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2 is real with symmetry \u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03bbi,\u03b2\u03b1 which makes Eq. (4) Hermitian. A physical realization for this N -channel model can be implemented by using a layered structure depicted in Fig. 1b, where each layer with M flavors encodes a single SO(M) channel. Here, channel mixing is prevented by a charging energy Eci of each channel (except i = 1) [60]. Therefore, Eci needs to be larger than the temperature or bias voltage (however, large Eci will decrease the bare Kondo couplings \u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2). When Eci 6= 0 with \u03bb independent of both channel and flavor indices, we will have an intermediate fixed point at weak coupling, which is found to be stable in terms of anisotropy of flavors; Without fine-tuning of channel couplings, the weaker channel couplings flow to zero, considering large N .\nBy using perturbative renormalization group in the large-N limit [17, 36, 58, 69, 70], we derive the third order equation for the coupling constant \u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2 from Eq. (4),\nd\u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2 dl = \u03c10(\u03bb 2 i )\u03b1\u03b2 (5)\n\u2212\u03c120\u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2 \u2211 j [ (\u03bb2j )\u03b1\u03b1 + (\u03bb 2 j )\u03b2\u03b2 \u2212 2(\u03bbj,\u03b1\u03b2)2 ] ,\nwhere l = ln(D0/D) with D (D0) denoting the running (bare) cutoff energy scale and \u03c10 is the density of states per length. The three terms at the second line in Eq. (5) correspond to the three Feynman diagrams in Fig. 2a. On the isotropic line \u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03bb (for \u03b1 6= \u03b2) we have,\nd\u03bb dl = (M \u2212 2)(1\u2212 2N\u03c10\u03bb)\u03c10\u03bb2 . (6)\nThus, the stable intermediate fixed point is \u03bb\u2217 = 1/(2N\u03c10) and moves to weak coupling in the large-N limit. At \u03bb \u2248 \u03bb\u2217, d\u03bb dl \u2261 \u03b2(\u03bb) \u2248 \u2212(M\u22122)(\u03bb\u2212\u03bb\u2217)/(2N). The slope of the beta function is \u03b2\u2032(\u03bb\u2217) = \u2212(M\u22122)/(2N) which means a large-N scaling dimension 1 + (M \u2212 2)/(2N) in the irrelevant direction. This agrees with the scaling dimension of the leading irrelevant operator with N channels and M flavors \u2206LIO = 1 + (M \u2212 2)/(2N +M \u2212 2) obtained from the CFT [21, 24\u2013 26, 71] [72]. The forth and fifth order correction to Eq. (6) are respectively of order NM2\u03c130\u03bb 4 and N2M2\u03c140\u03bb 5 and are subleading by a factor M/N , which makes the large-N perturbation expansion convergent [41, 58].\nThe solution of Eq. (6) is\n\u03bb(D)\n\u03bb\u2217 = f\u22121\n[ (D/TK) \u2206\ne2\n] , f(x) = |1/x\u2212 1|e1/x\u22121, (7)\nwhere we introduced the Kondo temperature TK = D0[e 2f(\u03bb0/\u03bb\u2217)] \u22121/\u2206 and \u2206 = (M \u2212 2)/(2N). We will have two solutions for Eq. (7) depending on whether the initial (bare) coupling constant \u03bb0 = \u03bb(D0) is larger or smaller than the fixed point coupling \u03bb\u2217 (see Fig. 2b). Since the lowenergy fixed point is at weak coupling in the large-N limit, Eq. (7) gives the full cross over for the running coupling \u03bb(D), extending beyond the CFT prediction.\nConductance at large-N . In both N = 1, SO(M) topological Kondo [41, 42, 46, 47, 49] andN = 2, SO(4) topological Kondo [Eq. (2)], the fixed point (T = 0) conductance is given by a universal fractional multiple of G0 = e2/h. Here, we first evaluate the conductance perturbatively in \u03bb0 by using Kubo formula [66] and find G\u03b1\u03b2 = G0(\u03c0\u03bb0\u03c10)2(1\u2212M\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2) to lowest order. By evaluating the next-order correction to the conductance at finite frequency \u03c9, we find a logarithmic divergence \u223c \u03bb30 ln(D/D0) where D = max{T, \u03c9}. The divergence results from renormalization of the coupling \u03bb, described by the RG equation (6). This indicates that for T \u03c9, G\u03b1 6=\u03b2(T ) = G0[\u03c0\u03bb(T )\u03c10]\n2, plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 2b. Remarkably, in the large-N limit \u03bb(T ) remains small and the full cross over function, Eq. (7), can be found exactly as long as the bare coupling \u03bb0 is small. At low temperatures, T TK , the conductance approaches its zerotemperature value with a power-law characteristic of a NFL,\nG\u03b16=\u03b2(T )/G0 = \u03c02\n4N2\n[ 1 + c\u03b1\u03b2 ( T\nTK\n)(M\u22122)/2N] , (8)\nwhere the dimensionless constant can be explicitly obtained in the isotropic case, c\u03b1\u03b2 = \u00b1\u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2c with c = 2e2 \u2248 0.27, based on the cross over function, Eq. (7). (The sign \u00b1 is determined by the initial condition \u03bb0 \u2277 \u03bb\u2217.) The temperaturedependent correction \u223c T\u2206LIO\u22121, also obtained from Eq. (7), matches with first-order correction from the leading irrelevant operator, see below Eq. (6), somewhat similar to the case of resistivity in SU(2) MCK [27]. This is notably different from the single-channel topological Kondo effect where the first order correction vanishes [41] and temperature correction is \u223c T 2(\u2206LIO\u22121).\nThe fixed point (T = 0) conductance above (i.e., the first term) can be verified forM = 4, in which case we can map the\n4 N -channel SO(4) topological Kondo to 2NCK by a unitary transformation [66]. From the mapping, we find the conductance of the N -channel SO(4) model [66]:\nG\u03b16=\u03b2(M = 4, T = 0)/G0 = sin 2[\u03c0/(2N + 2)] , (9)\nwhich bears resemblance to the 2NCK fixed point conductance [31, 32]. The N = 2 case gives the fixed point conductance (first term) in Eq. (2). The N = 1 result agrees with Ref. [42, 46, 47] while the large-N limit agrees with our previous result, Eq. (8).\nImpurity entropy at large-N . The NFL nature of the lowtemperature fixed point becomes apparent in the impurity entropy Simp = ln g where g can take a non-integer value. As mentioned in the introduction and displayed by Eq. (3), the 1 and 2-channel topological Kondo models generically show a non-integer g. Also, g for the N -channel case can be calculated by using modular S-matrix [21, 30]. The modular S-matrix of SO(M) is given in Ref. [73] and the general information of it can also be found in Ref. [74]. We then find Eq. (3) in the case N = 2. Above we saw that in the largeN limit the fixed point coupling moves to weak coupling. In this case the impurity is weakly screened and we find in the large-N limit,\ng =\n{ 2(M\u22121)/2 [ 1\u2212 (M\u22122)(M\u22121)M\u03c0 2\n192N2\n] , M is odd\n2(M\u22122)/2 [ 1\u2212 (M\u22122)(M\u22121)M\u03c0 2\n192N2\n] , M is even. (10)\nThis result indeed reflects the fact that the impurity is almost free at large-N [same conclusion can be made from the conductance (8)]. The impurity entropy is that of M free Majoranas (with a fixed total parity) with a correction of order 1/N2 from the screening by the itinerant electrons. The values in Eq. (3) are the ground state degeneracy at the fixed point \u03bb\u2217 without taking large-N limit. They are smaller than the above first term, giving the ground state degeneracy at \u03bb = 0. This agrees with the g-theorem in CFT, stating that the ground state degeneracy becomes smaller along the RG flow [23, 27, 67, 75] from \u03bb = 0 to \u03bb\u2217.\nFlavor anisotropy. Since the NFL behavior in the conventional single-channel topological Kondo model is stable to flavor anisotropy [41], it is natural to expect the same to be true for its multichannel generalization. Indeed, by considering the physically-motivated [66] flavor-anisotropic coupling \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 = [\u03bb+(\u03bb\n\u2032\u2212\u03bb)(\u03b41\u03b1+\u03b41\u03b2)] in Eq. (5), we find two nontrivial fixed points with the majority coupling \u03bb = 1/(2N\u03c10) in both, while the minority coupling is either \u03bb\u2032 = 1/(2N\u03c10) or \u03bb\u2032 = 0. The first one is isotropic and stable, while the second fixed point is unstable, see Fig. 3a. Thus, flavor anisotropy remains irrelevant in the multichannel generalization of the topological Kondo model.\nChannel anisotropy. Since the NFL fixed point of the conventional SU(2) MCK is unstable to channel anisotropy [2, 71, 76], it is crucial to investigate channel anisotropy in the multichannel topological Kondo model. We consider a flavor isotropic but channel anisotropic version of Eq. (4) with \u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03bb1 for i = 1, . . . , N1 and \u03bbN1+i,\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03bb2 for i = 1, . . . , N2. If we consider large-N1 and large-N2 limit,\nFIG. 3. RG flow of (a) flavor and (b) channel anisotropies. The isotropic lines are denoted in orange with the black point showing the isotropic intermediate fixed point. (a) Flavor anisotropy. The isotropic fixed point (black point) is at \u03bb = \u03bb\u2032 = 1/(2N\u03c10) and is stable. The red fixed point is the isotropic fixed point of the SO(M \u2212 1) model and is unstable and anisotropic in terms of M flavors. (b) Channel anisotropy with the case N1 = N2 shown. The isotropic fixed point (black point) is at \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 1/2[(N1+N2)\u03c10] which is unstable. Depending on which of \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is larger, the stable fixed point is the purple [\u03bb1 = 1/(2N1\u03c10), \u03bb2 = 0] or the pink [\u03bb1 = 0, \u03bb2 = 1/(2N2\u03c10)] one.\nwe will have (j = 1, 2)\nd\u03bbj dl = (M \u2212 2)\u03bbj\u03c10(\u03bbj \u2212 2N1\u03bb21\u03c10 \u2212 2N2\u03bb22\u03c10) . (11)\nThe RG flow is shown in Fig. 3b and has 2 stable anisotropic fixed points. When \u03bb1 6= \u03bb2, the smaller coupling constant flows to zero and the larger one, \u03bbi, flows to 1/(2Ni\u03c10). The isotropic fixed point \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 1/[2(N1+N2)\u03c10] is unstable.\nConclusions. We generalized the topological Kondo interaction into its N \u2265 2-channel version by adding new sets of floating leads connected to the Majorana island (see Fig. 1). Consequently, we analyzed the two-channel case for its impurity entropy [Eq. (3)] and conductance [Eq. (2)]. The former indicates an emergent Fibonacci anyon, beyond the singlechannel model. Another departure from the single-channel model is the NFL correction to conductance, which is of first order in the irrelevant operator, see below Eq. (8). The introduced multichannel generalization allowed us to develop a convergent large-N perturbation theory. Under the large-N limit, we found that the multichannel topological Kondo has a stable fixed point at weak coupling. By using perturbative RG, we were able to solve for the running coupling constant, giving us the full cross over from the free fixed point to the intermediate one, see Eq. (7) and Fig. 2. We also considered the flavor and channel anisotropies in the large-N limit [see Fig. 3, Ref. [66] and Eqs. (11)], finding that the flavor anisotropy is irrelevant, while the channel anisotropy is relevant. Our work suggests further study into the exotic physics found in multichannel Kondo models that are beyond conventional, SU(2)symmetric, spin systems.\nAcknowledgments.

We also show the impurity entropy for generalM,N , deriving its large-N limit, explain the details of the flavor anisotropy we considered and discuss channel anisotropy in the case of O(1) anisotropic channels.\nS1. CONDUCTANCE IN THE WEAK-TUNNELING LIMIT\nIn this section, we evaluate the conductance in the limit of large number of channels N . We will use the Kubo formula:\nGij\u03b1\u03b2 = Re lim\u03c9\u21920 \u22121 ~\u03c9 \u222b \u221e 0 dt ei\u03c9+t\u3008[Ii\u03b1(t), I j \u03b2(0)]\u3009, (S1)\nwhere \u03c9+ = \u03c9 + i\u03b7 with \u03b7 a positive infinitesimal. For it, we will need to first evaluate the current-current correlation function, which we now derive. In the weak-tunneling limit, the charge current operator for channel j and flavor \u03c1 is most conveniently defined as\nIj,\u03c1 = \u2212e dNj,\u03c1 dt = \u2212i e ~ [H,Nj,\u03c1], where Nj,\u03c1 = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e dx\u03c8\u2020j,\u03c1(x)\u03c8j,\u03c1(x), (S2)\nand the integration is over the lead. In the main text, we take j = 1, i.e., we consider the channel that is not floating (has no charging energy term). Generally, the full Hamiltonian H can be written as\nH = H0 +HK = N\u2211 i=1 M\u2211 \u03b1=1 \u2211 p pc \u2020 p,i\u03b1cp,i\u03b1 \u2212 1 2 N\u2211 i,k=1 M\u2211 \u03b1 6=\u03b2=1 \u03bbik\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b1\u03b3\u03b2\u03c8 \u2020 i,\u03b1(0)\u03c8k,\u03b2(0), (S3)\nand we allow for generic anisotropies in the interaction term. Hermiticity requires that \u03bbik\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03bb ki \u03b2\u03b1. Since H0 conserves the\nparticle number in a lead, the current is given by the commutator of N\u0302j,\u03c1 and V ,\nIj,\u03c1 = \u2212i e\n~ [HK , Nj,\u03c1] = i\ne\n2~ N\u2211 i=1 M\u2211 \u03b1=1 \u03bbij\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c1 [ \u03c8\u2020i,\u03b1(0)\u03c8j,\u03c1(0) + \u03c8 \u2020 j,\u03c1(0)\u03c8i,\u03b1(0) ] (S4)\nwhere we used the Hermiticity requirement to combine two sums. Then, we can find the following average\n\u3008Ii\u03b1(t)I j \u03b2(0)\u3009 = \u2212\ne2 2~2 [ (\u03bbij\u03b1\u03b2) 2 \u2212 \u2211 i\u2032,\u03b1\u2032 \u03bbi \u2032i \u03b1\u2032\u03b1\u03bb i\u2032j \u03b1\u2032\u03b2\u03b4ij\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 ] G<(\u2212t)G>(t). (S5)\nHere, we define the Green\u2019s functions,\n\u3008\u03c8\u2020i\u2032,\u03b1\u2032(t)\u03c8j,\u03b2(0)\u3009 = \u2212iG<(\u2212t)\u03b4i\u2032j\u03b4\u03b1\u2032\u03b2 and \u3008\u03c8i,\u03b1(t)\u03c8 \u2020 j\u2032,\u03b2\u2032(0)\u3009 = iG>(t)\u03b4ij\u2032\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2\u2032 . (S6)\nBy Fourier transforming into momentum space, we get for free fermions\nG<(\u2212t) = i\nL \u2211 p ei pt/~f( p) = i\u03c10 \u222b 0 \u2212\u221e d ei (t\u2212i\u03b7)/~ = ~\u03c10 t\u2212 i\u03b7 , (S7)\nG>(t) =\u2212 i\nL \u2211 p\u2032 e\u2212i p\u2032 t/~[1\u2212 f( p\u2032)] = \u2212i\u03c10 \u222b \u221e 0 d e\u2212i (t\u2212i\u03b7)/~ = \u2212 ~\u03c10 t\u2212 i\u03b7 , (S8)\nwhere f( ) = (e\u03b2 + 1)\u22121 is the Fermi function, replaced by a step function at T = 0. Also, we approximated the density of states as \u03bd(E) \u2248 \u03bd(EF ). We defined \u03c10 = \u03bd(EF )/L as the density of states per length at the Fermi energy. We have regularized the integration over energy by considering using the short-time (UV) cutoff \u03b7 = ~/D0 (D0 is the bare cutoff mentioned in the main text).

(S19)\nIn the large-N limit, we can access the intermediate fixed point within perturbation theory. In this case, with fixed point coupling \u03bb\u2217 = 1/(2N\u03c10), we find a zero-temperature conductance Gii\u03b1\u03b2/G0 = (\u03c0\n2/4N2)(1 \u2212M\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2), which gives the first term in Eq.

The next-order correction to conductance in the weak coupling\nTo go beyond the above discussed lowest order calculation, it is convenient to use the following expression for the weaktunneling correction to the average of operator O(t):\n\u03b4 \u3008O(t)\u3009 = \u2212 i ~ \u222b t \u2212\u221e dt\u2032 \u3008[O(t), HK(t\u2032)]\u3009 , (S20)\nwhere HK is the tunneling perturbation. Taking O(t) = [Ii\u03b1(t), I j \u03b2(0)], we obtain the next-order correction to conductance [see Eq.

(S21)\nS-3\n(Since we are here considering the T = 0 limit, we will see later that in the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0 the correction \u03b4Gij\u03b1\u03b2(\u03c9) diverges.) We note that [Ii\u03b1(t), I j \u03b2(0)]\n\u2020 = \u2212[Ii\u03b1(t), I j \u03b2(0)].

(S35)\nIn the isotropic case \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03bb(1\u2212 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2), we get (\u03bb2)\u03b1\u03b2\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 = (M \u2212 2)\u03bb3(1\u2212 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2) and (\u03bb3)\u03b1\u03b2\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 = (M \u2212 2)(M \u2212 1)\u03bb3\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 . Finally, we obtain the low-frequency conductance to third order in coupling constant,\nGii\u03b16=\u03b2(\u03c9)/G0 = (\u03c0\u03c10\u03bb) 2 [ 1\u2212 2(M \u2212 2)\u03c10\u03bb ln\n~\u03c9 D0\n] . (S36)\nWe thus find that the leading correction to the conductance diverges in the dc limit, \u03c9 \u2192 0. This divergence is a result of the Kondo renormalization of the coupling constant \u03bb, described by the first term in the RG equation (5) of the main text. While the above calculation was done at T = 0, we expect that at finite temperature, the logarithmic correction would become \u223c ln max{T, \u03c9}. This suggests that in the dc limit the temperature-dependent conductance can be written as Gii\u03b16=\u03b2(T )/G0 = [\u03c0\u03c10\u03bb(T )]\n2 where we use the renormalized coupling \u03bb(T ) \u2248 \u03bb0 \u2212 (M \u2212 2)\u03c10\u03bb20 ln(T/D0) with cutoff scale T . Upon lowering the temperature, the correction starts to increase. However, in the large-N limit this increase will be cutoff by higher-order correction to the conductance, which are captured by the full RG equation (5) [or Eq. (6)]. The conductance therefore stays small for the entire cross over to T \u2192 0 at which \u03bb(T )\u2192 \u03c0/(2N), where we expect the value Gii\u03b16=\u03b2(0)/G0 = \u03c02/(4N2).\nS2. FIXED POINT CONDUCTANCE OF MULTICHANNEL SO(4) TOPOLOGICAL KONDO MODEL\nIn this section, we derive the fixed point (T = 0) conductance of the N -channel SO(4) topological Kondo model by using a mapping to the 2NCK SU(2) Kondo model, whose conductance was evaluated in Ref.

The mapping is straightforwardly generalized to show the equivalence between N -channel SO(4) topological Kondo and 2NCK models.\nNext, we connect the fixed point conductances of 2NCK and N -channel SO(4) topological Kondo models by using the CFT method [41, 81]. We seek the general result beyond the weak tunneling limit. Therefore, we introduce the left- and right-moving currents at position x as IXj(x) = \u03c8 \u2020 Xj(x)\u03c8Xj(x) where X = L,R labels the left/right movers in the linearized spectrum of the (flavor) \u201clead\u201d j = 1, . . . , 4, in channel 1. (Even though we consider N -channel SO(4) topological Kondo, the conductance in the main text is measured between different flavors in the first channel.) The conductance matrix can then be evaluated by using the Kubo formula,\nGjj\u2032 = Re lim \u03c9\u21920\n1\n~\u03c9 \u222b \u221e 0 dt ei\u03c9t 1 L \u222b L 0 dx\u3008[Ij(y, t), Ij\u2032(x, 0)]\u3009 , Ij = IRj \u2212 ILj , (S51)\nwhere voltage is applied to a region 0 < x < L in the lead j\u2032 and y is the point in lead j where the current is measured (but whose value does not matter) [81]. The current correlation functions can be evaluated in the free case in the absence of a Kondo impurity. In that case, the conductance matrix vanishes as no current is carried, Gfreejj = G free j 6=j\u2032 = 0. It is nevertheless convenient to introduce the following \u201cL/R conductance\u201d that characterizes the backscattering of left-moving currents into right-moving ones at the end of the wire (from hereon, we focus on j = 1 for simplicity),\nGfreeL,R;11 = Re lim \u03c9\u21920\n1\n~\u03c9L \u222b L 0 dx \u222b \u221e 0 dt ei\u03c9t\u3008[IR,1(y, t), IL,1(x, 0)]\u3009free = e2 h , (S52)\nwhere we used the correlation function (vF is the Fermi velocity)\n\u3008[IR,1(y, t), IL,1(x, 0)]\u3009free = i e2v2F (2\u03c0)2 4\u03b7(y + x\u2212 vF t) [\u03b72 + (y + x\u2212 vF t)2]2 . (S53)\nHere, \u3008\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009free is the zero-temperature average over the free Hamiltonian which contains only kinetic terms and no Kondo interaction. In addition, a boundary condition was applied that connects left and right mover so that their correlation function above does not vanish [81].\nWe wish to evaluate the conductance, Eq. (S51) with j 6= j\u2032, in the Kondo intermediate coupling fixed point. Due to the SO(M) symmetry of the flavors, we only need to calculate GKondo12 . Furthermore, only the LR current correlation function contributes to the off-diagonal conductance, so GKondo12 = G Kondo L,R;12. As pointed out for example in Refs. [5, 29, 31, 41], the correlation functions at the Kondo intermediate coupling fixed point are proportional to their free fixed point values, Eq. (S53), up to a constant factor, given by the modular S-matrix. For example, we show below that\n\u3008IL1IR2\u3009Kondo = 1\u2212 SN\n4 \u3008IL1IR1\u3009free , (S54)\nwhere SN = cos[3\u03c0/(2N + 2)]/ cos[\u03c0/(2N + 2)] is given by the appropriate elements of the modular S-matrix. The arguments of \u3008IL,i(y, t)IR,j(x, 0)\u3009 are hidden for brevity, as we mostly do not need them. The correlator \u3008\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u3009Kondo denotes the average\nS-6\nover the Hamiltonian with Kondo interaction at the Kondo coupling fixed point. This indicates that the desired conductance can be obtained by considering the ratio of the corresponding current correlation function and \u3008IL1IR2\u3009free:\nGKondo12 GfreeL,R;11 = \u3008IL1IR2\u3009Kondo \u3008IL1IR1\u3009free = 1\u2212 SN 4 = sin2\n\u03c0\n2N + 2 , (S55)\nwhich gives Eq. (9) of the main text.\nA. Derivation of the relation (S54)\nIn order to derive Eq. (S54), we follow Ref. [41] and introduce the densities J (c)X (x) = \u03a8 SO(4)\u2020 X (x)\u03a8 SO(4) X (x), J (d) X (x) = \u03a8SO(4)\u2020X (x)D1\u03a8 SO(4) X (x), and D1 = diag(1,\u22121,\u22121, 1) for the SO(4) model. The correlation functions of charge currents can be expressed in terms of these densities, see Eq. (S56) below. Moreover, these densities can be expressed in the 2CK basis as J (c)X = \u03a8 2CK\u2020 X \u03a8 2CK X and J (d) X = \u2212\u03a8 2CK\u2020 X D1\u03a8 2CK X . Therefore, we can use the well-known [5] relations between correlation functions of the Kondo (K) and free (f) fixed points in the MCK model. We give these results in the 2N -channel case which can be mapped to N -channel SO(4) topological Kondo model. The operator J (c)X transforms like an SU(2) singlet (it does not couple to the impurity) and therefore satisfies \u3008J (c)L J (c) R \u3009K = \u3008J (c) L J (c) R \u3009f, while J (d) X transforms in the adjoint (spin-1) representation and thus \u3008J (d)L J (d) R \u3009K = SN \u3008J (d) L J (d) R \u3009f where SN = S11/2S 0 0/(S 1 0S 0 1/2) = cos[3\u03c0/(2N + 2)]/ cos[\u03c0/(2N + 2)] is given by elements of the modular S-matrix for 2NCK [31]. Now we only need to express the charge current correlation functions in terms of the above correlations functions. In the isotropic case, we have \u3008ILjIRj\u3009 = \u3008IL1IR1\u3009 for all j and \u3008ILjIRj\u2032\u3009 = \u3008IL1IR2\u3009 for all j 6= j\u2032. By these definitions and constrains for the current correlation functions, we find\n\u3008J (c)L J (c) R \u3009 = 4\u3008IL1IR1\u3009+ 12\u3008IL1IR2\u3009, \u3008J (d) L J (d) R \u3009 = 4\u3008IL1IR1\u3009 \u2212 4\u3008IL1IR2\u3009. (S56)\nAt the free case, \u3008IL1IR2\u3009f = 0 which simplifies Eq. (S56) to\n\u3008J (c)L J (c) R \u3009f = 4\u3008IL1IR1\u3009f, \u3008J (d) L J (d) R \u3009f = 4\u3008IL1IR1\u3009f . (S57)\nAt the Kondo fixed point, by inverting Eq. (S56) we get\n\u3008IL1IR1\u3009K = 1\n16 \u3008J (c)L J (c) R \u3009K +\n3\n16 \u3008J (d)L J (d) R \u3009K = 1 + 3SN 4 \u3008IL1IR1\u3009f , (S58)\n\u3008IL1IR2\u3009K = 1\n16 \u3008J (c)L J (c) R \u3009K \u2212\n1\n16 \u3008J (d)L J (d) R \u3009K = 1\u2212 SN 4 \u3008IL1IR1\u3009f . (S59)\nThus, we have derived Eq. (S54).\nS3. IMPURITY ENTROPY FROM CFT\nThe impurity entropy is given as Simp = ln g. Kimura [21, 67] has calculated g for generalN -channel SO(M) model (denoted spinor SO(M)2N in Ref. [21]). They used one of the main results from CFT [5, 21, 67], which is g = S0s/S 0 0 where S j s is the modular S-matrix. The modular S-matrix of SO(M) is given by Hung et al [73] and the general information of it can also be found [74]. Here, s means the representation for the impurity. In terms of Dynkin labels, we can take s = (0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 0, 1) for both of odd and even M cases. Thus, we get g for arbitrary M,N :\ng(M,N) = 2 p \u220fp\u22121 i=0 cos [ \u03c0(i+1/2) 2N+2p\u22121 ] , M = 2p+ 1 is odd 2q\u22121 \u220fq\u22121 i=1 cos [ \u03c0i 2N+2q\u22122 ] , M = 2q is even\n(S60)\nS-7\nThe first thing we can check is the large-N limit where we can consider\ng(2p+ 1, N) =2p p\u22121\u220f i=0 cos [ \u03c0(i+ 1/2) 2N + 2p\u2212 1 ] \u2248 2p p\u22121\u220f i=0 [ 1\u2212 \u03c0 2(i+ 1/2)2 8N2 ] (S61)\n\u22482p [ 1\u2212 p\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u03c02(i+ 1/2)2 8N2 ] = 2p [ 1\u2212 p(2p\u2212 1)(2p+ 1)\u03c0 2 96N2 ] . (S62)\ng(2q,N) =2q\u22121 q\u22121\u220f i=1 cos ( \u03c0i 2N + 2q \u2212 2 ) \u2248 2q\u22121 q\u22121\u220f i=1 ( 1\u2212 \u03c0 2i2 8N2 ) (S63)\n\u22482q\u22121 ( 1\u2212 q\u22121\u2211 i=1 \u03c02i2 8N2 ) = 2q\u22121 [ 1\u2212 q(q \u2212 1)(2q \u2212 1)\u03c0 2 48N2 ] . (S64)\nThese two equations give Eq. (10) in the main text. When taking N \u2192 \u221e, g(2p + 1, N) = 2p is the dimension of the spinor representation of SO(2p+1) and g(2q,N) = 2q\u22121 is also the dimension of the spinor representation (two spinor representations have the same dimension), which means that the island is isolated from the itinerant electrons so that the dimension is totally given by the quantum dimension of Majoranas.\nLet us take a look at N = 1 and N = 2 case. The first one is mentioned by Altland et al. [45] that\ng(M, 1) =\n{\u221a 2p+ 1 = \u221a M, M = 2p+ 1 is odd\n\u221a q = \u221a M/2, M = 2q is even\n(S65)\nBased on this, we can calculate the second case by using\ng(2p+ 1, 1) = 2p p\u22121\u220f i=0 cos [\u03c0(i+ 1/2) 2p+ 1 ] = \u221a 2p+ 1, and g(2q, 1) = 2q\u22121 q\u22121\u220f i=1 cos (\u03c0i 2q ) = \u221a q. (S66)\nThus, when N = 2, we have\ng(2p+ 1, 2) = 2p p\u22121\u220f i=0 cos [\u03c0(i+ 1/2) 2p+ 3 ] = g(2p+ 3, 1) 2 cos [ \u03c0(2p+1) 2(2p+3) ] = \u221a2p+ 3 2 cos [ \u03c0(2p+1) 2(2p+3)\n] . (S67) g(2q, 2) = 2q\u22121\nq\u22121\u220f i=1 cos [ \u03c0i 2q + 2 ] = g(2q + 2, 1) 2 cos [ \u03c0q 2(q+1) ] = \u221aq + 1 2 cos [ \u03c0q 2(q+1)\n] . (S68) In terms of M , they are\ng(M, 2) =\n{ 1 2 \u221a M + 2/ cos [ \u03c0M 2(M+2) ] , M is odd\n1 2\n\u221a (M + 2)/2/ cos [ \u03c0M\n2(M+2)\n] , M is even\n(S69)\nwhich is Eq. (3) in the main text. As we know, N = 1 spinor SO(4) is like 2-channel Kondo. It is natural to think N = 2 spinor SO(4) as 4-channel Kondo. They indeed have the same g, which is \u221a 3 \u2248 1.732. Also, as Beri et al. [41] mentioned that N = 1 spinor SO(3) maps to 4-channel Kondo, we verify that N = 2 spinor SO(3) maps to 8-channel Kondo which has\ng(3, 2) = \u221a (5 + \u221a 5)/2 = 1.90211.\nS4. MORE DETAILS ON FLAVOR AND CHANNEL ANISOTROPIES\nIn this Section, we give more details on the flavor anisotropy (Sec. S4 A) and the channel anisotropy in the case of O(1) anisotropic channels (Sec. S4 B).\nA. Tunneling anisotropy induced flavor anisotropy\nIn the main text, we considered a specific kind of flavor anisotropy and showed that it is irrelevant, see the flow diagram in Fig. 3a. Here, we explain the physical consideration behind using that exact anisotropy and derive the RG equations that were used to obtain the flow diagram.\nS-8\nFIG. S1. RG flow diagram of channel anisotropy in the large-N1 limit with N2 \u223c O(1). The isotropic fixed point (black point) is at \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 1/2[(N1 + N2)\u03c10] and is unstable. When \u03bb1 > \u03bb2, the stable fixed point is the purple one [\u03bb1 = 1/(2N1\u03c10), \u03bb2 = 0] while when \u03bb1 < \u03bb2, the coupling \u03bb2 flows to strong coupling.\nIn our model, not any anisotropy is physically realistic due to the form of \u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2 in Eq. (4) [see also Eq. (1)], defined by the product ti\u03b1t i \u03b2 of real tunneling amplitudes. It means that the corresponding anisotropy should originate from the anisotropy of t\u03b1 = (~t)\u03b1 instead of from \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 directly. Here we consider the channel-isotropic case and therefore suppress the channel index i in ti\u03b1 and \u03bbi,\u03b1\u03b2 . For allN channels, let us consider anisotropic tunneling ~t = (t\n\u2032, t, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , t), corresponding to a different coupling to flavor \u03b1 = 1. This form leads to the flavor anisotropy presented in the main text, \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 = [\u03bb+ (\u03bb\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb)(\u03b41\u03b1 + \u03b41\u03b2)]. We find from Eq. (5) of the main text,\nd\u03bb dl = (1\u2212 2N\u03bb\u03c10)\n[ (M \u2212 3)\u03bb2 + \u03bb\u20322 ] \u03c10, d\u03bb\u2032\ndl = (M \u2212 2)\u03bb\u2032\u03c10\n( \u03bb\u2212N\u03bb2\u03c10 \u2212N\u03bb\u20322\u03c10 ) . (S70)\nFrom these RG equations, we find two nontrivial fixed points with the majority coupling \u03bb = 1/(2N\u03c10) in both, while the minority coupling is either \u03bb\u2032 = 1/(2N\u03c10) or \u03bb\u2032 = 0 (see Fig. 3a of the main text). The first one is isotropic and stable, while the second fixed point is unstable. This shows that flavor anisotropy remains irrelevant in the multichannel generalization of the topological Kondo model.\nB. Channel anisotropy when N2 is not large\nIn the main text, we discussed the channel anisotropy with N1, N2 both large. In this section, we only consider N1 large but N2 of order 1. We then obtain from Eq. (11) of the main text,\nd\u03bb1 dl = (M \u2212 2)\u03bb21\u03c10(1\u2212 2N1\u03bb1\u03c10) , d\u03bb2 dl = (M \u2212 2)\u03bb22\u03c10(1\u2212 2N1 \u03bb21 \u03bb2 \u03c10) . (S71)\nIn the isotropic case, \u03bb1 = \u03bb2, we recover Eq. (6) of the main text. When \u03bb1 > \u03bb2, the isotropic fixed point is unstable and the flow is towards the fixed point \u03bb1 = 1/(2N1), \u03bb2 = 0. When \u03bb1 < \u03bb2, the coupling \u03bb2 flows towards strong coupling. The corresponding RG flow diagram is plotted in Fig. S1."
