The meeting brought together more than 200 computational and experimental scientists from\nwithin and outside the photosynthesis research community and thereby allowed computational and theoretical biophysicists to reach out to the experimental community, explaining their methods and their latest results in a didactic and accessible way. With the same aim, this Special Issue collects an exciting series of original research articles and reviews dedicated to a variety of computational approaches that capture different aspects of photosynthesis with a resolution ranging from single atoms up to the mesoscale.\nPigments and the interactions amongst them modulate the spectroscopic and photophysical properties of the photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes. By combining quantum chemistry calculations and spectral simulations, Pishchalnikov et\u00a0al. (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11120- 022- 00955-2) unveiled the conformational states in the \u03b2-ionone rings of canthaxanthin, a keto-carotenoid involved in cyanobacterial photoprotection. Excitonic interactions amongst pigments can further shape their spectroscopic properties, by mixing excited states of different pigments. However, the picture becomes more complicated for Chl a aggregates, because of the vibronic coupling between the two lowest excited states Qy and Qx of this molecule. Seibt et\u00a0al. (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11120- 022- 00946-3) investigated, for the first time, the Qy/Qx coupling in excitonic Chl a dimers, and showed that the vibronic sideband of the Qy transition is strongly altered by the vibronic mixing with the Qx state. Another often overlooked detail in excitonically coupled systems is the importance of intermolecular charge-transfer (CT) states, which are notoriously difficult to model with quantum chemical methods. Sen and Visscher (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11120- 022- 00950-7) tackled this problem using subsystem Density Functional Theory to obtain a balanced description of excitonic and charge-transfer (CT) states, and studied the role of CT states in the strongly coupled Chl a611-a612 dimer of the major light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) of plants.\nLight-harvesting proteins control the arrangement and interactions of the multiple pigments bound to them and,\nLorenzo Cupellini and Nicoletta Liguori have contributed equally to this work.\n* Lorenzo Cupellini lorenzo.cupellini@unipi.it\n* Nicoletta Liguori Nicoletta.Liguori@icfo.eu\n1 Dipartimento di Chimica e Chimica Industriale, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Via Moruzzi 13, 56124\u00a0Pisa, PI, Italy\n2 Department of\u00a0Physics and\u00a0Astronomy and\u00a0Institute for\u00a0Lasers, Life and\u00a0Biophotonics, Faculty of\u00a0Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The\u00a0Netherlands\n3 ICFO-Institut de Ciencies Fotoniques, The Barcelona Institute of\u00a0Science and\u00a0Technology, Castelldefels, 08860\u00a0Barcelona, Spain\n2 Photosynthesis Research (2023) 156:1\u20132\n1 3\nin turn, tune their photophysical properties. Computational approaches are now able to describe these effects with unprecedented accuracy. For example, spectral simulations can be used to gain insight into the properties and function of light-harvesting complexes. Through a simultaneous fit of different experimental spectra, Novoderezhkin and Croce (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11120- 022- 00979-8) developed a structure-based model for Lhca1, one of the four Lhcs attached to Photosystem I, and by locating the low-energy pigments were able to reconstruct the excitation energy transfer network that allows energy transport towards the PSI core. A different, first-principles strategy was used by Cupellini et\u00a0al. (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11120- 022- 00925-8) in the investigation of a light-harvesting complex from purple bacteria. With molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and multiscale quantum chemical calculations, they investigate the exciton structure of the unique seven-fold symmetrical LH2 of Mch. purpuratum and explain the origin of its spectral properties.\nPhotosynthetic reactions involve changes in the oxidation and protonation states of the cofactors and residues of the photosystems. However, these changes are difficult to describe unequivocally from experiments, and computational tools are needed to complement experimental knowledge. Amin (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11120- 022- 00941-8) developed a machine learning classification model that assigns oxidation states to individual Mn atoms in experimental Cryo-EM, X-ray, and X-ray-free electron laser (XFEL) structures of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII). On the other hand, Wei et\u00a0al. (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11120- 022- 00973-0) combined MD simulations and multi-conformation continuum electrostatics (MCCE) analysis to exhaustively describe the protonation ensemble of bacterial reaction centers (RCs). In turn, this allowed analyzing proton transfer pathways from the cytoplasm to the secondary quinone.\nOne of the most studied pigment-protein complexes in photosynthesis is possibly PSII, which uses the absorbed solar energy to power water splitting. This is achieved via a complex catalytic photocycle involving a large number of redox reactions. Gates et\u00a0al. (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11120- 022- 00985-w) built a model for a cyclic electron flow connected to PSII (PSII-CEF) supported by flash oximetry of PSII microcrystals and found evidence for a regulatory quinone site in PSII of cyanobacteria. Their results are complemented by Zournas et\u00a0al. (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11120- 023- 00997-0), who developed a kinetic model that can explain and connect multiple experimental sources, such as oximetry measurements, and provide a quantitative assessment of the reactions contributing to PSII-CEF.\nThis Special Issue also features two reviews on different aspects of the modeling of antenna complexes. The minireview by Maity and Kleinekath\u00f6fer (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11120- 022- 00969-w) describes the recent advances in the atomistic modeling of light-harvesting complexes. This review summarizes the fundamental principles of a multiscale modeling of light-harvesting complexes, focusing on the MD simulations-based determination of exciton-phonon spectral densities and their use in the simulation of exciton dynamics and spectra. In a perspective article, Navakoudis et\u00a0al. (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11120- 022- 00935-6) review instead the recent efforts of their group and of others in describing, especially by means of classic MD simulations, the effect of changes in the environment (pH, salt and external triggers) on both the pigments and protein matrix in regulating the lightharvesting activity of the antenna complexes of plants.\nThe enthusiastic response to this Special Issue and to the conference ComPhot 2021 underscores the importance of developing and applying computational methods to all aspects of photosynthesis, as well as promoting discussions and collaborations between the experimental and computational communities of photosynthesis.
