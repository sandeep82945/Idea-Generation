    "abstractText": "Anion exchange membranes (AEM) have gained attention recently as a promising candidate for low-cost water electrolysis systems to produce hydrogen, linked with renewable energy resources as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. The development of potential materials for producing and analyzing AEM is an imperative step towards commercialization and plays a competitive role in the hydrogen production industry. In this article, we developed a composite anion exchange membrane prepared by activating a commercial support structure (Celgard\u00ae 3401) with a commercially available functional group (Fumion\u00ae FAA-3) through a phase-inversion process. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis demonstrated the phaseinversion procedure as an effective methodology. Furthermore, the cell performance test result (with Celgard/Fumion) was very promising and even better in comparison with a commercial membrane commonly applied in alkaline electrolysis (Fumasep). We also developed a testing procedure for membrane performance evaluation during electrolysis which is very critical considering the effect of CO2 absorption on membrane conductivity.",

            "text": "As we face a major challenge in the energy and environment sectors, considering the anthropogenic climate change hypothesis, searching for alternative energy strategies has become critical for future world energy demands. Among the numerous alternative energy approaches, green hydrogen serves as a low-cost, easily available, and abundant energy source with zero emissions of carbonaceous species and can play a key role in the energy transition strategy toward a stable and green future as it has a significant role in several applications and industries [1,2]. At the same time, it should be taken into consideration that the footprint of hydrogen technologies depends on their production processes and energy sources [3]. From this point of view, water electrolysis is a very promising and desired approach because of its compatibility with different types of electricity generation [4,5]. The search for investigation of efficient and cost-effective anion exchange membrane electrolyzers have been given much attention due to their ability to offer the advantages of conventional alkaline electrolysis technology [6,7] while also addressing the issue of cost associated with proton exchange membranes (PEMs) by using non-platinum group metals as electrocatalysts [8]. The anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is a technology built in a stack with solid polymer membranes to provide high volumetric energy density and it is compatible with non-precious metal catalyst electrodes which results in cost reduction of hydrogen production. The main difference between alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), which is a well-developed and mature technology [9\u201311], and AEMWE is that the\nMembranes 2023, 13, 109. https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes13010109 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/membranes\nMembranes 2023, 13, 109 2 of 15\ndiaphragm that separates two half-cells in the former technology, despite being permeable to ions between two sides of the system, is not conductive. The conductivity is provided by alkaline hydroxide filling a porous diaphragm, while in AEMWE, the polymeric membrane is non-porous and has intrinsic anionic conductivity [1,12\u201315]. It is worth mentioning that in contrast to PEM electrolyzers which use only polymer electrolytes, many AEMWEs use liquid electrolytes (e.g., KOH or K2CO3 solutions) in addition to polymer electrolytes to improve reaction kinetics [16]. The liquid electrolyte increases the local pH at the catalyst\u2013 electrolyte interface, generating an additional electrochemical interface. Having addressed the major challenges associated with AWEs, AEMWEs have attracted increasing interest from industrial and academic researchers in recent years. Numerous studies and several papers and reviews have been published on the development of alkaline membranes for different applications (electrodialysis, electrodialysis reversal, desalination, or electro-deionization [17,18]) and from different aspects (separate components, material, technology, and operational conditions [2,16,19\u201321]). Most of the membranes produced were optimized for chemically less-aggressive environments concerning the pH and the operating temperature. The literature concerning the synthesis of anion exchange membranes (AEM) regarding those that use a hydroxide exchange membrane specifically designed for the electrolysis of water is scarce. The main function of the anionic membrane in alkaline electrolyzers is to transport hydroxide ions from the cathode to the anode and to avoid the movement of electrons and crossover of the gases produced by the electrochemical reactions in the two compartments. These membranes should ideally have high OH\u2212 conductivity, high chemical stability (alkaline, oxidative, and thermal stability), excellent mechanical properties under wet conditions and high differential pressures, and low gas permeability. Generally, such membranes consist of a polymeric backbone that is responsible for mechanical and thermal stability and that is modified by positively charged functional groups on their backbone or pendant side chains. These modifiers facilitate anion movement and are responsible for ion-exchange capacity, ion conductivity, and transport number, enabling a zero-gap configuration and differential pressure operation. A variety of AEM backbones have been studied and developed so far, such as polystyrene [22,23], poly-phenylene oxide (PPO) [24,25], polysulfone [26] or fluorinated polymers [27\u201329], poly-ethylene-co-tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) [30], polyetherimide (PEI) [31], polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [32], poly-ether-ether ketone [33], poly(arylene ether ketone) [34], and poly-carbazole [35]. As well, the most extensively investigated functional groups are: \u2013NH3+, \u2013RNH2+, \u2013R2NH+, =R2N2+, \u2013R3P+, \u2013R2S+, quaternary ammonium salts (QA) [36,37], and tertiary amines (e.g., BTMA) [31,32]. The cycloaliphatic QAs show remarkable alkaline stability [38]. As investigated and reported [6,39,40], the major challenge of anion exchange membranes is their low chemical and thermal stability, since the backbone and the functional group both suffer from hydroxide-induced degradation under alkaline conditions [41]. The degradation of polymer backbones leads detrimentally to chain rift, decreases the molecular weight, and results in increased brittleness of the membrane, and this effect is prominent in the presence of aromatic ether groups. Therefore, aromatic ether groups, which are present in many cheap and easily accessible polymers such as PEEK, PESU, and polyphenylene oxide (PPO), should be avoided. Furthermore, anion exchange membranes suffer from lower ionic conductivity in comparison to PEMs (such as Nafion) due to the lower mobility of OH\u2212 than that of H+. Currently, a few alkaline solid polymeric membranes have been commercialized, such as Fumasep\u00ae, Sustainion\u00ae, AemionTM, and OrionTM, and their main characteristics are summarized in Table 1 [2,39]. Membranes with different backbone materials show different conductivity, as shown in Table 1. The last three have a very high value with respect to Fumasep\u00ae, but it should be kept in mind that Fumasep is activated in Cl\u2212 form, which has inferior mobility to that of OH\u2212 [42], with a significantly higher thickness. There are very sporadic literature data on the usage of these membranes, and many were obtained\nMembranes 2023, 13, 109 3 of 15\nwith unequal activation procedures or ionomer material, cell components, operational conditions, and even time periods of the cell performance tests, which makes a comparative study very difficult. The most-used membrane that has shown stable performance in AEMWE [1,43] is Fumasep, which we used as reference material in this article.\n* HMT-PMBI: hexamethyl-p-terphenyl poly (bibenzimidazolium).\nThe activation of porous support with desirable mechanical characteristics is a very simple approach to synthesizing anionic membranes. The performance of the membrane is then profoundly influenced by the supporting structure and the ionomer coupled together, so investigating the material and techniques to fabricate the backbone and activate it with different ionomers is a very interesting approach to developing AEMs. A supporting structure that can be used for this purpose is Celgard\u00ae, a typical polypropylene (PP) microporous membrane separator that is recognized for use in batteries [47,48]. PP is a lowcost polymer that is widely used for microporous membrane fabrication globally because of significant properties such as good thermal and mechanical stability and high resistance to extreme pH conditions [43,44]. Due to its numerous manufacturing applications and the huge amount of PP used globally, much research has been conducted on the sustainable assessment of PP production and recycling recently [49]. In the past, Stano et al. [50] used Celgard 2400 membranes modified with graft polymerization of acrylic acid after plasma activation in the conventional liquid alkaline electrolyzer. Tsehaye et al. [51] used Celgard 3501 impregnated with a commercial anion exchange ionomer (Fumion) to modify the support membrane to use as a separator in a Zn\u2013air battery. In this work, a composite anion exchange membrane was prepared by activating a porous support of commercial Celgard 3401 with an ionomer solution in a phase-inversion process. Phase inversion is an established technique commonly used for preparing membrane nano/microstructures. It is referred to as a chemical process in which a polymer is transformed from a liquid state to a solid state [48,52]. We used the commercially available ionomer solution Fumion (Fumatech Co., Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany) with a QA functional group. The chemical structure of the Fumion polymer has not been disclosed; however it is reported [53] to contain a polyaromatic polymer with quaternary ammonium functional groups. The composite membrane was synthesized, characterized, and successively tested in a small lab electrolyzer to evaluate its performance. With the promising results revealed, we approach the challenge of fabricating porous substrates with controlled properties and a desired structure using low-cost polymeric materials with a highly efficient method to provide a robust, reproducible backbone for AEM in the future."

The air permeability measurement of the membrane after activation with Fumion was performed with a Gurley 4320 densitometer (Rycobel, Deerlijk, Belgium) as described elsewhere [54].\n2.2.2. Ionic Exchange Capacity (IEC)\nThe IEC of an ion-exchange membrane (IEM) is an analytical parameter that represents the ability of ionic transfer within an alkaline solid polymeric membrane and is significantly influenced by the ion conductivity of the membrane [3]. It is measured when the counterions are OH\u2212 using a titration method and it is expressed as milliequivalent per gram of the dry membrane (meq g\u22121 dry IEM). The method is well-described elsewhere [55]. Briefly, the membrane was converted into OH\u2212 form by immersing it in 100 mL 1M KOH and 2 days. Then the membrane was washed and immersed in 100 mL of a 0.01 HCl solution for 24 h and finally we measured IEC using back titration. The OH\u2212 content in the membrane was calculated using the following equation:\nIEC = nHCL,i \u2212 nHCL, f\nm (1)\nMembranes 2023, 13, 109 5 of 15\nwhere nHCL,i is the amount of HCl in the initial solution (0.01 M, 100 mL), nHCL, f is the amount of HCl in the final solution after neutralization of the membrane, and m is the dry membrane mass. Attention must be placed in this characterization that could be affected in some step by the accumulation of carbonate and bicarbonate ions with an underestimation of the final value of IEC.\n2.2.3. Ionic Conductivity\nThe membrane conductivity can be obtained from the measurement of the resistivity of the membrane against the flow of current using a four-point probe electrochemical cell (Figure 2). The method is explained elsewhere [55]. Briefly, the cell is composed of two compartments that can house membranes with a diameter of 3.5 cm with an area exposed to the solution equal to 7.07 cm2. The ionic conductivity of the membrane was determined with at least three successive measurements of the potential difference between the reference electrodes. A linear voltage sweep was applied in short time intervals (5 s), voltage vs. current was plotted, and the slope gives us the resistance (\u2126) without the membrane and with the membrane between the two compartments. For this experiment, the NaCl solution in the cell was maintained at 0.5 M. Without the membrane, the measured resistance of the aqueous NaCl solution between the two reference electrodes is Rcell; with a membrane, the total resistance is the sum of the resistance of the cell and that of the membrane: Rmeasure = Rmembrane + RCell . Knowing the cell resistance (Rcell), the value of the membrane resistance is defined as the difference between these two resistances: Rmembrane = Rmeasure \u2212 RCell . The ionic conductivity, \u03c3 (S cm\u22121), of the membrane can be determined using the following relationship:\n\u03c3 = 1\nRmembrane\nl S\n(2)\nwhere l is the thickness of the membrane (cm), S is the surface area of the membrane exposed to the electric field (cm2), and Rmembrane is the membrane resistance (\u2126).

In our study, both membranes showed the same carbonation effect in electrolysis (Figure 7). Figures 8 and 9 show the voltage vs. current density after the different electrolysis times shown in Figure 7. The electrolysis at constant current density was stopped after various time intervals and a Galvano-dynamic experiment was performed at 1 mAs\u22121. Initially, the electrolyzer\u2019s current density is constrained by the conductivity drop due to the accumulation of carbonate and bicarbonate ions, which inhibit the transport of OH\u2212 ions. Following Figures 8 and 9, both systems reached a higher maximum current density as electrolysis proceeded but with different values. A minimum amount of current and gas evolution (reactions 6 and 7) allows the elimination of carbonate ions and the recovery of the OH\u2212 conductivity resulting in an increase in the electrolysis current. However, the maximum current density achievable by the system progressively increases with the working hours of the electrolysis test. The same behavior of current limitation due to the CO2 effect was studied in detail by Ziv et al. in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and is well illustrated in references [57,58]. As follows from the voltage\u2013current density plot, at zero time the cell with the Celgard/Fumion membrane reaches a maximum current density of 569 mA cm\u22122 while after 163 h of electrolysis the maximum current reaches 933 mAcm\u22122. The cell with Fumasep membrane also shows similar behavior, with 57 mAcm\u22122 at zero time and 740 mAcm\u22122 after 163 h. For both cells, the presence of a limiting effect due to hydroxide transport appears in the first working hours. However, the time expansion is more noticeable for the commercial membrane, whose recovery time is longer, likely due to its higher thickness. The results also indicate that thinner membranes are preferred since they react more rapidly to the de-carbonation process during electrolysis. The results revealed that measuring membrane performance in a small electrolysis cell is very challenging, and to make a reliable comparison between different membranes requires long-term electrolysis. Furthermore, preparation using phase inversion is a fast and easily applicable method for synthesizing composite membranes with different backbone structures and ionomer solutions.\nMembranes 2023, 13, 109 11 of 15Membranes 2023, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 19\nFigure 8.
