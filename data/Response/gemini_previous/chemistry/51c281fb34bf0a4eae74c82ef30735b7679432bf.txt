1. **Investigate the in vivo antioxidant and skin enzyme inhibitory activities of the isolated compounds (C-1 to C-7) using animal models.** This would provide more comprehensive data on the potential health benefits of these compounds and help determine their safe dosage range.


2. **Explore the synergistic effects of the isolated compounds in combination with other natural antioxidants or skin-lightening agents.** This could lead to the development of more effective and broad-spectrum antioxidant and skin depigmentation formulations.


3. **Study the structure-activity relationship of the isolated compounds to identify the specific structural features responsible for their antioxidant and skin enzyme inhibitory activities.** This knowledge could guide the design and synthesis of novel compounds with improved biological activity.


4. **Investigate the potential of the isolated compounds to protect against other types of cellular damage, such as DNA damage, protein oxidation, and inflammation.** This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their protective effects and identify additional potential applications.


5. **Evaluate the potential of the isolated compounds to inhibit the growth or virulence of pathogenic microorganisms.** This could lead to the development of new natural antimicrobial agents to combat infectious diseases.
