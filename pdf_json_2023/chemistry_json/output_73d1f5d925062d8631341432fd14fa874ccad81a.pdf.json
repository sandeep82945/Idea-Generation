Despite medical research advances, accurate recognition of AD remains challenging. Epidemiological evidence suggests that metabolic abnormalities are tied to higher AD risk.\nMethods: This study utilized case-control analyses with plasma samples and identified a panel of 27 metabolites using high-resolution mass spectrometry in both the Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and cognitively normal (CN) groups. All identified variables were confirmed using MS/MS with detected fragmented ions and public metabolite databases. To understand the expression of amyloid beta proteins in plasma, ELISA assays were performed for both amyloid beta 42 (A\u03b242) and amyloid beta 40 (A\u03b240).\nResults: The levels of plasma metabolites PAGln and L-arginine were found to significantly fluctuate in the peripheral blood of AD patients. In addition, ELISA results showed a significant increase in amyloid beta 42 (A\u03b242) in AD patients compared to those who were cognitively normal (CN), while amyloid beta 40 (A\u03b240) did not show any significant changes between the groups. Furthermore, positive correlations were observed between A\u03b242/A\u03b240 and PAGln or L-arginine, suggesting that both metabolites could play a role in the pathology of amyloid beta proteins. Binary regression analysis with these two metabolites resulted in an optimal model of the ROC (AUC = 0.95, p < 0.001) to e ectively discriminate between AD and CN.\nDiscussion: This study highlights the potential of advanced high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) technology for novel plasma metabolite discovery with high stability and sensitivity, thus paving the way for future clinical studies. The results of this study suggest that the combination of PAGln and L-arginine holds significant potential for improving the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) in clinical settings. Overall, these findings have important implications for advancing our understanding of AD and developing e ective approaches for its future clinical diagnosis.\nKEYWORDS\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, neurodegenerative biomarkers, human plasma, high-resolutionmass spectrometry, clinical diagnosis\nFrontiers in AgingNeuroscience 01 frontiersin.org\nYang et al. 10.3389/fnagi.2023.1189659"

            "text": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a form of neurological dementia that is progressive and irreversible; it has a significant negative impact on people\u2019s lives, society, and the economy (2021). Numbers of biochemical processes are affected in AD pathologies, which include the breakdown of amyloid precursor proteins, the phosphorylation of tau proteins, oxidative stress, poor energy, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, membrane lipid dysregulation, or disruption of neurotransmitter pathways (de la Monte and Tong, 2014; Procaccini et al., 2016). It is increasingly clear that many neurodegenerative diseases have a pre-symptomatic phase, during which pathological changes accumulate prior to the onset of symptoms (Golde, 2022). Thereof, early diagnosis and therapy during the progression of AD are critical and a rapid pace of development should be adopted (Cummings et al., 2022). Nevertheless, the challenge of obtaining a prompt and accurate diagnosis has hindered the development of therapies for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). As reported in a previous study, AD clinical trials are characterized by up to 80% screen failure rates (Aisen et al., 2016). Biomarkers enable the identification of the onset, profile, and severity of neurodegeneration-related brain alterations in particular patients who are in need of diagnosis, prognosis, and usage in clinical trials\u2014as both inclusion and outcome measures\u2014as the fieldwork to treat patients sooner and earlier (Bendlin and Zetterberg, 2022). The National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer\u2019s Association (NIA-AA) has proposed a research framework for using A/T/N biomarkers of \u03b2 amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers to define Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These A/T/N biomarkers shall also serve as continuous measures to reflect different cognitive stages (Jack et al., 2018).\nCurrently, the availability of amyloid beta (A) PET and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker tests for amyloid beta peptides, tau, and other neuroproteins (A/T/N classifiers) enables their use to diagnose brain amyloid pathology. However, there is still an unmet need for an accessible, radiation-free, minimally invasive, economical, quick, and analytically validated diagnostic approach to simplify clinical trial enrollment (Jack et al., 2016). Besides, the biochemical and physiological changes in the brain that characterize the illness beyond amyloid and tau deposition are still poorly understood, even though AD is currently characterized based on amyloid-plaque and tau neurofibrillary tangle deposition inside the neocortex (Jack et al., 2018).\nMetabolome analysis has emerged as a novel strategy for the development of disease biomarkers in diagnosis, as well as for monitoring the progression of the disease with its underlying pathophysiology (Trivedi et al., 2017). The metabolome is a collection of small molecules that is produced by metabolic processes, arranged in biochemical pathways. It is impacted by various internal and external variables, including genetics (Holmes et al., 2008). It has been indicated that metabolomics appears to be of uttermost relevance in AD as several metabolic changes, such as higher insulin and insulin resistance levels, are associated with an increased risk of AD (Schrijvers et al., 2010). Thus, metabolites are now crucial diagnostic indicators of dementia before memory loss, defining its presence or absence.\nAs the plasma metabolome interacts and exchanges molecules with every organ and tissue, including the brain, it reflects various physiological and pathological changes. This makes it a promising avenue for identifying biomarkers for a range of disorders. Furthermore, interorgan communication is an important and conserved mechanism that maintains body homeostasis. Dysregulation of the systemic homeostatic system would result in metabolic and neurological disorders (Vogt and Bruning, 2013; Deleidi et al., 2015). Moreover, plasma is a bodily fluid that is simple to obtain and causes minimal discomfort to patients, which allows for the collection from large cohorts and repeated sampling (Lawton, 2008). Therefore, it is worth studying the systemic changes in blood metabolite levels associated with AD.\nAnalytical techniques have significantly improved, with highresolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instruments being readily available for determining the majority of chemical compounds (Niedzwiecki et al., 2020). Apart from determining the accurate properties of these metabolites, collective quantification is of great importance for metabolism study (Koek et al., 2011). The most popular mass spectrometers for UHPLC-HRMS are Orbitrap (OT) or TOF-based systems, as they enable the best MS data acquisition. However, according to instrument investigation, the resolution of a UHPLC-coupled OT instrument has been sacrificed in favor of achieving greater separation with higher acquisition rates (Kaufmann, 2018; de Souza et al., 2021). Furthermore, in line with our previous research on the discovery of AD urine metabolites, the OT systems for molecule detection displayed impressive stability performance (Zhang et al., 2022). Moreover, recent research that employs powerful bioinformatic techniques and high-throughput measurements of hundreds of metabolites has thoroughly documented the molecular alterations and diseaserelated pathways (Chandler et al., 2016; Sales et al., 2017; Uppal et al., 2017; Zhuang et al., 2021).\nWe performed a metabolomic analysis of the plasma of patients with AD and CN using high-resolutionmass spectrometry (HRMS) from these viewpoints. Our current investigation supports the application of metabolomics analysis as a discrimination test between AD and CN, which may provide new insight for future clinical diagnosis."

In addition, ROC analysis was performed to compare the discrimination ability between potential proteins and MS-discoveredmetabolites using A\u03b242 and the ratio of A\u03b242/A\u03b240, respectively, with AUC (A\u03b242)= 0.76 (95% confidence interval CI, 0.64, 0.89) and AUC (A\u03b242/A\u03b240)= 0.70 (95% confidence interval CI, 0.56, 0.83). Furthermore, the ROC curves of potential protein biomarkers are shown in Figure 5B. Pearson analysis indicated a positive correlation between A\u03b242/A\u03b240 and either PAGln or LArg. For A\u03b242/A\u03b240 and PAGln, r = 0.5396, p < 0.0001, while for A\u03b242/A\u03b240 and L-Arg, r = 0.3240, p < 0.05. Both correlation analyses indicated a statistically significant relationship between novel metabolites and the classical protein ratio (Figure 6).\nFrontiers in AgingNeuroscience 09 frontiersin.org\nYang et al. 10.3389/fnagi.2023.1189659\nFIGURE 4 Boxplots showed upregulated plasma metabolites of (A) phenylacetylglutamine and (B) L-arginine (p < 0.0001).

            "text": "There is an unmet demand for an examination that is simple, less intrusive, and affordable in the clinical diagnosis of AD. Untargeted metabolomics presents enormous potential in the exploration of newmolecules implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we found that AD was closely linked to increased plasma levels of phenylacetylglutamine (PAGIn) and L-arginine (L-Arg). Furthermore, the AD group showed lower levels of metabolites of fatty acyls, sphingolipids, and steroids, in addition to other organic acids.\nPAGIn, a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, which is derived from the essential amino acid phenylalanine, has been extensively studied as a toxin in chronic kidney disease and adverse cardiovascular events (Aronov et al., 2011; Poesen et al., 2016; Nemet et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2021). Emerging evidence have demonstrated that gut microbiota dysbiosis is functionally connected to brain immune dysfunctions (Sampson and Mazmanian, 2015). Also, the increased permeability of the gut and blood\u2013brain barrier induced by microbiota dysbiosis may mediate or affect AD pathogenesis or other neurodegenerative disorders (Jiang et al., 2017). A metabolic profiling study on\nFrontiers in AgingNeuroscience 10 frontiersin.org\nYang et al. 10.3389/fnagi.2023.1189659\nFIGURE 5 (A) ROC curves with metabolite features of L-arginine, PAGIn, and binary logistic regression of two metabolites (PAGIn + L-Arg) and (B) ROC curves with protein features of A\u03b242 and the ratio of A\u03b242/A\u03b240.\nFIGURE 6 (A) Linear regression analysis between PAGIn and A\u03b242/A\u03b240. (B) Linear regression analysis between L-Arg and A\u03b242/A\u03b240.\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) using a mass spectrometry-based approach found that PAGIn was significantly elevated in the PD group as compared to the healthy controls, and its metabolic disturbances suggested that proteolytic metabolism was highly activated in PD (Shao et al., 2021). Nevertheless, limited findings have shown the dysregulation of plasma PAGIn in AD. This is our first observation documenting that plasma PAGIn is significantly elevated in AD patients, presenting an excellent discriminating power as a potential metabolite biomarker. Studies suggest that stochastic AD is associated with atherosclerosis, redox stress, inflammatory processes, and/or abnormal neurotransmitter and glucose metabolism in the brain (Yi et al., 2009). Thus, it is probable that PAGIn is involved in one or more pathophysiological processes, as previously stated. However, the underlying causes of PAGIn in Alzheimer\u2019s disease still require clarification.\nL-Arg is a semi-essential amino acid that can be metabolized to form numerous bioactive molecules. Its involvement in AD is largely based on scattered information from a single pathway (Malinski, 2007). In a study examining arginine metabolism, researchers investigated three areas of the human brain: the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), the hippocampus (HPC), and the\ncerebellum (CE) in AD patients. They found that L-Arg was significantly elevated in the SFG area of AD patients, while Lornithine (a product of arginase) showed a dramatic reduction in all three areas in AD (Liu et al., 2014). Interestingly, these findings were consistent with our results in the plasma metabolite investigation. The box plots illustrated that L-Arg was significantly elevated in the AD group, while its byproduct, L-ornithine, notably decreased in the AD group (Figures 4A, L). Furthermore, research has indicated that L-Arg has several direct and indirect effects on human vasculature, suggesting that it may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of both atherosclerosis and AD. For instance, LArg has been found to be involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes, including neurotransmission (Chen and Chang, 2002), neurogenesis and neuroplasticity (Marcinkowska et al., 2022), cellular redoxmetabolism and redox stress (Perry et al., 2002; Tonnies and Trushina, 2017), inflammation (Wijnands et al., 2015), and regulation of cerebral blood flow (Matsuda et al., 2007).\nIn our previous study utilizing AD urine samples, an increase in potential diagnostic metabolites of uric acid, creatine, and choline was observed in the AD group as compared to the CN group. Conversely, in plasma samples, while uric acid displayed\nFrontiers in AgingNeuroscience 11 frontiersin.org\nYang et al. 10.3389/fnagi.2023.1189659\na decreasing trend, both creatine and choline indicated no significant differences between the two groups (Zhang et al., 2022). The variability in the concentration of biomarkers in body fluids is due to the kidney\u2019s crucial role in reabsorbing certain substances from urine back into the bloodstream. Recent research also demonstrated a correlation between blood biomarker concentration with urinary biomarkers (Ho et al., 2015; Kukova et al., 2019). It appears that these metabolites undergo dynamic fluctuations during certain stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nBesides, different biomarkers may denote the progression of\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (Teunissen et al., 2022).\nIn addition, we investigated the AD biomarkers of A\u03b240, A\u03b242, APOE4, and TAU in blood to find their association with reported results (Rachakonda et al., 2004; Niedzwiecki et al., 2020; Thijssen et al., 2022). It has been suggested that the plasma ratio of A\u03b242/A\u03b240 is often used to discriminate amyloid PET positive and negative individuals across the clinical AD continuum (De Meyer et al., 2020; Verberk et al., 2020). In a case\u2013control study, researchers used the ratio of A\u03b242/A\u03b240 in the discrimination test and acquired a good AUC(ROC), which is above 0.8 (Thijssen et al., 2022). Based on our ELISA results, we performed the discrimination test of ROC with A\u03b242 and the A\u03b242/A\u03b240, which resulted in AUC (A\u03b242) as 0.76 and AUC (A\u03b242/A\u03b240) as 0.70, and this was kept in line with reported cases.\nHuman APOE is a glycoprotein that is highly expressed in stressed neurons, astrocytes, microglia, vascular mural cells, and choroid plexus cells. It has been suggested that low plasma levels of APOE are linked to an elevated risk of developing future Alzheimer\u2019s disease and all forms of dementia in the general population (Rasmussen et al., 2015). Also, lower plasma concentrations of APOE were supported by the finding that APOE levels are negatively correlated with A\u03b2 levels in multiple brain regions when analyzed in non-demented individuals (Shinohara et al., 2013). In this study, AD patients held lower APOE levels as compared to the CN participants, which presented a similar trend with reported cases.\nResearch suggested that Tau protein lost its ability to bind to microtubules, and therefore, its normal role of keeping the wellorganized cytoskeleton is no longer effective (Kolarova et al., 2012). One prospective study indicated that high plasma Tau was found in patients with AD dementia compared with cognitively normal individuals and patients withMCI (Mattsson et al., 2016). However, another study revealed a significant decrease in plasma levels of total tau among individuals with MCI compared with cognitively normal controls, with a further highly significant reduction in AD patients compared with both MCI and normal controls (Sparks et al., 2012).\nIn our study, we observed a decrease in plasma t-tau levels in the AD group, which differs from the trends observed in other research groups (Mattsson et al., 2016; Shen, 2020). Another study that tested the alteration of plasma tau in AD found that plasma tau partly reflects AD pathology, but there is a considerable overlap with normal aging, especially in individuals without dementia (Mattsson et al., 2016). Recent studies suggested that elevated levels of tau in the blood are not specific to AD, which could also be found in other neuron degeneration conditions, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Neumann et al., 2006; Boeve et al., 2022; Pan et al.,\n2022). Thus, future studies should test longitudinal plasma tau measurements in AD.\nNevertheless, the exciting and rapid developments in plasmabased assays hold promise for prescreening in research (reducing the need for, and associated costs with, lumbar punctures and PET scans), once properly validated, which would fulfill the diagnostic purposes in clinical practice. In this study, we employed the highresolution mass spectrometer to screen the plasma metabolites, with the optimized and stabilized LCMS method, and we were able to determine hundreds of features that enable us to perform the discovery study. We found that both PAGIn and L-Arg showed pretty good discriminate power in separating AD patients from CN individuals, which exerted their underlying possibilities in clinical diagnosis. In addition, the combination group of PAGIn and LArg enhanced the diagnostic power from ROC (AUC) 0.91 to ROC (AUC) 0.95, thus improving the accuracy in AD discrimination with this test.\nEpidemiological studies in different populations showed an independent relationship between the development of dementia and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), implying the presence of shared biological processes (Cortes-Canteli and Iadecola, 2020; Stakos et al., 2020). Our results indicate that both plasma PAGIn and L-arginine are significant in separating Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) from cognitively normal individuals. However, limited investigations suggest that PAGIn and L-arginine are associated with AD but not CVD in plasma investigation. It is interesting to observe that, using mass spectrometry in one measurement, PAGIn and L-arginine were found to be significantly elevated in AD.\nBesides, we introduced the discrimination analysis with A\u03b242 and A\u03b242/A\u03b240. The best ROC of the protein biomarker is A\u03b242 with an AUC of 0.76, which was in line with the literature. Moreover, protein\u2013metabolite interactions are of importance in cellular procedure, since these compounds could serve as cofactors for proteins to mediate protein function. This has not been investigated in our previous studies on Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It is interesting to note the positive correlations between A\u03b242/A\u03b240 with PAGIn or L-Arg with statistical significance. This suggests that PAGIn and L-Arg hold great promise in the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. These findings should be further validated in future tests using clinical specimens.\nHowever, our study has some limitations. First, it is restricted by the lack of access to pathology reports and APOE genotype information, which impacts the scope of clinical parameters that can be included in this article. In future research, MRI could be used to visualize decreased gray matter (GM) volume in AD patients or a positron emission tomography (PET) scan could be conducted to detect amyloid deposition in AD patients, as these methods are considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d for assessing AD states in clinical settings, and would support the diagnosis of metabolite biomarker studies. Second, the observational nature of the study design means that the causal links between two metabolites (PAGln and L-Arg) and AD cannot be established. Instead, a functional metabolomics technique must be used to uncover the underlying pathways. Third, our study was conducted at a single location and had a biased patient selection; the sample size was also small, which means that further validation at other research centers and larger sample sizes are required. Finally, absolute quantitation analysis of\nFrontiers in AgingNeuroscience 12 frontiersin.org\nYang et al. 10.3389/fnagi.2023.1189659\ndifferential metabolites was not performed due to a limited plasma sample, which should be done in future cohort studies to validate the findings."

We demonstrated the added advantage of examining metabolic expression signatures and constructing a comprehensive picture of metabolic change by examining categorization and regulatory signatures. Not only could studying additional signatures highlight potential predictive and regulatory indicators but could also uncover essential features that may have been overlooked when only investigating expression signatures. Particularly, PAGIn and L-Arg have been identified as potential essential features in metabolic alteration and showed an excellent discrimination ability in AD diagnosis. Our study also highlights a significant association between the AD protein ratio of A\u03b242/A\u03b240 and PAGIn or L-Arg. These findings indicate that protein biomarkers correlated with metabolites can strengthen AD diagnosis. Future studies will be required to corroborate these results and to clarify the specific roles of these metabolites in AD metabolic change."
