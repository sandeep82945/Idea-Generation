The xplosion produces a fast shock propagating out into the circumstellar edium, and a second \u2018reverse\u2019 shock expanding back into the jecta. SNe are expected to radiate o v er the entire multi-wavelength pectrum, and for now hav e been observ ed at all e xcept at the ery highest energies. In the very\u2013high\u2013energy range, CCSNe are mportant because they have been invoked as being capable of ccelerating particles up to, or even above, the PeV range (see e.g. atischeff 2009 ; Bell et al. 2013 ; Marcowith et al. 2014 ; Murase, hompson & Ofek 2014 ; Schure & Bell 2014 ; Cardillo, Amato & lasi 2015 ; Giacinti & Bell 2015 ; Zirakashvili & Ptuskin 2016 ; etropoulou et al. 2017 ; Bykov et al. 2018a ; Marcowith et al. 2018 ;\nE-mail: pierre.cristofari@obspm.fr\na D i\n2022 The Author(s) ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\nurase et al. 2019 ; Fang et al. 2019 ) and re vie ws by Bykov et al. 2018b ), Tamborra & Murase ( 2018 ).\nBesides, the PeV range is an important milestone in cosmic ray CR) physics. The spectrum of CRs measured at the Earth follows a emarkable power law in energy, with mild deviation, up to the knee omain, at \u223c 1\u20133 PeV, where a major spectral deviation occurs. The ources producing the bulk of CRs are expected to accelerate particles p to the PeV range, and to lie within the Galaxy (Cristofari, Blasi & mato 2020a ). The hunt for pe v atrons is no w a well-identified key arget of the astroparticle community (see e.g. Blasi 2019 ; Cherenkov elescope Array Consortium et al. 2019 ; Gabici et al. 2019 ; Cristofari 021 , for re vie ws on the topic). The possibility that CCSNe could accelerate PeV particles is a trong moti v ation for their study. The acceleration of PeV particles hould directly lead to the production of a potentially detectable mount of gamma-rays from the GeV to the multi\u2013TeV range (Kirk, uffy & Ball 1995 ), due to the interaction of accelerated protons with nterstellar medium (ISM) nuclei, through the production of pions.\nT 2 2 m t 2 t a M T t C\nT o ( i p o o b t 2 2 i t ( t t t c m t w t s C\nt M I s i T a g\no e o 5 S m I h g e h\nt o I\nr t e a a i o (\nt w g S d c\n2 A\nT s a p p o d\n\u03c1\nw a w\nr\na\nT\nw d [ ( i w a O\nl w\nd\nn\nF a r\nM\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/511/3/3321/6517473 by C N R S - ISTO user on 07 April 2023\nhis possibility has been discussed in various works (Dwarkadas 013 ; Marcowith et al. 2018 ; Fang et al. 2019 ; Murase et al. 019 ), and recent studies based on Fermi -LAT data have reported arginally-to-moderately significant variable high-energy emission owards the peculiar H-rich superluminous SN iPTF14hls (Yuan et al. 018 ), the nearby Type IIP event SN 2004dj (Xi et al. 2020 ), and in he direction of the SN candidates AT2019bvr and AT2018iwp, with flux increase within 6 months after the disco v ery date (Prokhoro v, oraghan & Vink 2021 ). Future instruments optimised in the eV and multi\u2013T eV range (Cherenkov Telescope Array Consorium et al. 2019 ) might then be capable of detecting extragalactic CSNe. A primary limiting factor for the detection of CCSNe in the eV range is the distance, which determines the flux reaching the bserver. The flux is further expected to decrease inversely with time Tatischeff 2009 ). The \u03b3 -ray signal should also be degraded by the nteraction of gamma-rays with the low-energy photons from the SN hotosphere (Gould & Schr \u0301eder 1966 , 1967 ) during the first stages f the stellar outer env elope e xpansion, resulting in the production f electron\u2013positron pairs. This two-photon annihilation process has een discussed in various astrophysical contexts, generally under he assumption of isotropy (Aharonian, Khangulyan & Costamante 008 ; Tatischeff 2009 ; Murase et al. 2014 ; Wang, Huang & Li 019 ). None of these calculations took into account the anisotropy nherent in the problem, or the time of flight of the photons from he photosphere. The calculations carried out by Cristofari et al. 2020b ), and outlined below, include some important impro v ements hat considerably increase the accuracy, and enhance the validity, of he solutions: The time retardation effects of the SN photosphere, he Doppler effect o v er the frequenc y space, the full anisotropic alculation of the two-photon annihilation process, and a detailed odelling of the time evolution of both the forward shock and he SN photosphere. This more careful treatment of the problem, hich takes into account the di verging e volution of the radius of he SN photosphere and the forward shock, can produce results that ubstantially differ from the isotropic assumption, as illustrated in ristofari et al. ( 2020b ) in the case of SN 1993J. SN 1993J was disco v ered and well-monitored from the optical o radio range since the first days after its explosion in the Galaxy 81 (NGC 3031) (Ripero et al. 1993 ). It was classified as a Type Ib SN (Maund et al. 2004 ) due to the initial detection of H in the pectrum that later disappeared. The progenitor star was found to be n the range 13\u201320 M (Van Dyk et al. 2005 ; Marcaide et al. 2009 ). he close distance, and the high inferred mass-loss rate, makes it an ppealing candidate for the detection of an extragalactic SN in the amma-ray range.\nType IIb SNe occur at a relati vely lo w rate, comprising 5 per cent f the total core-collapse SNe (Smartt 2009 ). The bulk of CCSNe xpand in a lower density surrounding medium. The largest fraction f CCSNe are the Type II-P SNe, accounting for typically \u223c40\u2013 0 per cent of CCSNe. Here, the \u2018P\u2019 stands for plateau, since these Ne show a plateau in their optical light curve lasting for several onths. The high frequency means that the likelihood of a Type I-P SN being detected in an optical surv e y of nearby SNe is much igher. In this paper, we therefore, focus our attention on the expected amma-ray signal from Type II-P SNe in the \u223c30 d following the xplosion of the SN where the unabsorbed flux is expected to be the ighest (Tatischeff 2009 ; Marcowith et al. 2018 ). As we will show in this paper, the predicted flux is very sensitive o the SN parameters. Those affecting the gamma-ray flux can vary v er a wide range, which can lead to large variations in the flux itself. t is therefore important to study the expected flux over a plausible\nNRAS 511, 3321\u20133329 (2022)\nange of parameters. We explore the parameter space of SN quantities hat can possibly affect the gamma-ray signal: The total explosion nergy of the SN, the ejecta mass, the mass-loss rate of the wind, nd radius and temperature of the progenitor star. Their individual nd collecti ve ef fects on the absorption of the gamma-ray signal are nvestigated. The calculation of the time-dependent opacity is carried ut in a manner analogous to the one presented in Cristofari et al. 2020b ).\nThe lay-out of the paper is as follows: In Section 2, we describe he dynamics of the SN photosphere and SN shock, in Section 3, e describe the calculation of the gamma-ray signal including the amma-ray attenuation by the two-photon annihilation process, in ection 4, we present our results as a function of the parameters escribing the stellar progenitor and the SN explosion, and we onclude in Section 5.\nE VO L U T I O N O F T H E SUPERNOVA S H O C K N D PHOTOSPHERE\nhe evolution of the photospheric radius and the radius of the forward hock in the first few days after explosion can be described using pproximate analytical expressions. Before the SN explosion, the rogenitor star of a II-P SN is a red supergiant (RSG), in which the re-explosion density profile within the shell, under the assumption f an efficiently conv ectiv e env elope, can be approximated by (Chanrasekhar 1939 ):\n0 ( r 0 ) = \u03c11 / 2 (1 \u2212 r 0 /R ) n p , (1) here n p = 3/2 and R is the radius of the star, and \u03c11/2 , the density t r 0 = 0. After the SN explosion, the photospheric radius can be ritten in Gaussian cgs units as (Rabinak & Waxman 2011 ): ph ( t) = 2 . 9 \u00d7 10 14 cm ( f\n0 . 1\n)\u22120 . 062 ( E SN\n10 51 erg\n)0 . 41\n\u00d7 (\n\u03ba\n0 . 34 cm 2 g \u22121\n)0 . 093 ( M ej\nM\n)\u22120 . 31 ( t\ndays\n)0 . 81 (2)\nnd the photospheric temperature: ph ( t) = 1 . 7 eV ( f\n0 . 1\n)\u22120 . 037 ( E SN\n10 51 erg\n)0 . 027 ( R\n10 13 cm\n)1 / 4\n\u00d7 (\n\u03ba\n0 . 34 cm 2 g \u22121\n)\u22120 . 28 ( M ej\nM\n)\u22120 . 054 ( t\ndays\n)\u22120 . 45 (3)\nhere f = \u03c11 / 2 / \u0304\u03c10 , with \u03c1\u03040 = 3 M ej / (4 \u03c0R 3 ) the average ejecta ensity. Typical values for f are found for RSG in the range 0.079,0.13], M ej is the ejecta mass, E SN the total explosion energy kinetic energy), and \u03ba the opacity, assumed to be time and space ndependent (e.g. the opacity is dominated by Thomson scattering ith constant ionization). We note that the dependency of both r ph nd T ph on f is weak. r ph is dominantly dependent on E SN and M ej . n the other hand, T ph mostly depends on R and \u03ba . Fig. 1 shows the evolution of the photospheric temperature and uminosity. The latter quantity is calculated as L ph = 4 \u03c0r 2 ph \u03c3SB T 4 ph , here \u03c3 SB is the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant. The photospheric photon density is assumed to follow a blackbody istribution with a time-dependent temperature T ph ( t ):\n( , t ) = 2 2\nh 3 c 3\n1\nexp ( /kT ph ( t )) \u2212 1 cm \u22123 erg \u22121 sr \u22121 .

Indeed, the everse shock is typically propagating through higher densities, with lower velocity so that the maximum energy is lower (Telezhinsky t al. 2012 ). In case particle acceleration at the reverse shock ould produce gamma-rays: The lower velocity of the shock tends o reduce the maximum energy of accelerated particles, but the igher density in which the shock is propagating can lead to an nhanced production of gamma-rays but also stronger losses through p collisions. Therefore, all in all any acceleration at the reverse hock would increase the total gamma-ray signal and this makes our pproach a lower limit on the estimate of gamma-rays from Type I-P.\nThe SN strong forward shock resulting from the SN explosion an be described by self-similar solutions. We adopt the description roposed in Tang & Che v alier ( 2017 ) for a SN exploding in a wind rofile \u03c1w ( r ) = \u03b7s r \u2212s , with \u03b7s = M\u0307 w / (4 \u03bc\u03c0v w ), where M\u0307 w and v w are he mass-loss rate and wind terminal velocity of the RSG progenitor,\nnd \u03bc = (1 + 4 f He )/(1 + f He ) accounts for a fraction f He = 10 per cent f He in the ISM. The time evolution of the shock radius is then of he form:\nsh ( t) = R ch [ ( \u03b6 ( t\nt ch\n)( n \u22123) / ( n \u2212s) ) \u2212\u03b1\n+ ( \u03be ( t\nt ch\n)2 ) \u2212\u03b1/ (5 \u2212s) \u23a4 \u23a6 \u22121 /\u03b1\n(5)\nhere R ch = M 1 / (3 \u2212s) ej \u03b7\u22121 / (3 \u2212s) s and t ch = E \u22121 / 2 SN M 5 \u2212s 2(3 \u2212s) ej \u03b7 \u22121 / (3 \u2212s) s , and he parameters \u03b6 , \u03be , and \u03b1 depend on the SN type. In a wind density rofile, the characteristic radius and time read:\nch \u2248 129 ( M ej\nM\n)( M w\n10 \u22126 M yr \u22121 )\u22121 ( v w 10 6 cms \u22121 ) pc (6)\nch \u2248 17 . 7 ( E SN\n10 51 erg\n)\u22121 / 2 ( M ej\nM\n)3 / 2\n\u00d7 (\nM w\n10 \u22126 M yr \u22121 )\u22121 ( v w 10 6 cms \u22121 ) kyr . (7)\nEquation (5) describes the shock evolution provided that n > 5, ith n the slope of the density profile of the envelope of the exploding\ntar. For a typical Type II-P SNe, n = 10, \u03b6 = 1.03, \u03be = 0.477, s = , and \u03b1 = 4.56. The corresponding shock velocity is given by the eri v ati ve v sh = d R sh /d t . Hence, equation (5) can be reformulated explicitly with physical arameters of interest for Type II-P SNe:\nsh ( t) \u2248 4 . 2 10 14 cm ( E SN\n10 51 erg\n)0 . 44 ( M\u0307 w\n10 \u22126 M yr \u22121\n)\u22120 . 125\n\u00d7 ( v w\n10 6 cms \u22121 )0 . 125 (M ej M )\u22120 . 31 ( t days )0 . 875 . (8)\nDeviations from the value n = 10 have been proposed for outer N ejecta in RSGs, such as Matzner & McKee ( 1999 ) fixing it at n 11.73. We illustrate in Fig. 3 the evolution of r ph and R sh during the first 0 d after the SN explosion, for typical values of the mass-loss rate \u02d9 w = 10 \u22126 M yr \u22121 and ejecta mass M ej = 2, 4, and 10 M .\nMNRAS 511, 3321\u20133329 (2022)\n3\n3\nO a f r s r\nF\nw e a d s P b\n1 1 s h c B P 2 a s m e\nF\nw p e P & d\n3\nT a p o i a t i d t\nFigure 4. 2D diagram of the physical problem.

The typical gamma-ray flux at the SN shock thus reads:\n\u03b3 ( > 1 TeV ) \u2248 2 . 5 \u00d7 10 \u221214 cm \u22122 s \u22121 ( \u03beCR\n0 . 1\n)( M\u0307 w\n10 \u22126 M yr \u22121\n)2\n\u00d7 ( v w\n10 6 cms \u22121 )\u22122 ( D Mpc )\u22122 ( v sh ( t) 10 9 cms \u22121 )2\n\u00d7 ( R sh ( t)\n10 14 cm\n)\u22121 , (10)\nhere \u03beCR = P CR /\u03c1w v 2 sh is the CR pressure normalised to the kinetic ressure of the shock. Finally, we assume that the typical maximum nergy reached at Type II-P CCSNe is sufficiently high 100 TeV\u20131 eV in the month after the SN explosion (Bell et al. 2013 ; Schure Bell 2014 ; Inoue et al. 2021 ), so that the signal in the gamma-ray omain of interest is not affected.\n.2 Pair production gamma-ray attenuated flux\nhe calculation of the absorption due to pair-production is performed s in Cristofari et al. ( 2020b ). A 2D representation of the geometrical roblem is shown in Fig. 4 . To compute the total photon\u2013photon ptical depth at a given gamma-ray energy E , one needs to do an nte gration o v er six quantities: , the soft photon energy; \u03b8 the polar ngle between the direction of the centre of the photosphere, and he location of the soft photon emitting region, as view from the nteraction point (P); \u03c6, the corresponding azimuthal angle; l , the istance between (I) the gamma-ray emitting region and (P); \u03c8 0 , he angle of the emitted gamma-ray photon at the interaction point\nNRAS 511, 3321\u20133329 (2022)\nelative to the radial direction; and t , the time after the SN explosion: \u03b3 \u03b3 ( E) = \u222b t\n0 d t \u2032 \u222b \u03c0 \u03c8 0 , min d \u03c8 0 \u222b +\u221e 0 d l\n\u00d7 \u222b 1\nc min\nd cos \u03b8 \u222b 2 \u03c0\n0 d \u03c6 \u222b +\u221e min d d \u03c4\u03b3 \u03b3 d d d l , (11)\nhere the differential absorption opacity reads (Gould & Schr \u0301eder 966 , 1967 ): \u03c4\u03b3 \u03b3 = ( 1 \u2212 e \u03b3 e ) n \u03c3\u03b3 \u03b3 d d d l , (12)\nith e \u03b3 and e denoting the direction of the interacting gammaay photon and soft photon respectively. The cross-section \u03c3\u03b3\u03b3 or the pair production process \u03b3 + \u03b3 \u2192 e + + e \u2212 is derived n Gould & Schr \u0301eder ( 1967 ), d = sin \u03b8d \u03c6d \u03b8 is the solid angle f the surface emitting the photons of energy and n is the adiation density. Equation (11) is a generalisation of equation (A.8) f Dubus ( 2006 ) which takes into account temporal effects. It requires he calculation of two more integrals on the time t and emission ngle \u03c8 0 .\nThe gamma-ray photon flux can also be degraded by electron\u2013 ositron production in the Bethe\u2013Heitler process through their nteraction with ambient nuclei (Murase et al. 2014 ). As the incident amma-ray photons are isotropically distributed the opacity due to he Bethe\u2013Heitler process reads:\nBH = R int n i \u03c3BH , (13) here the Bethe\u2013Heitler cross-section for photons with energies m e c 2 can be expressed as \u03c3 BH \u223c 2.3 10 \u221227 [ln ( E ph, \u03b3 , GeV ) + 5.7) we have assumed an ef fecti ve charge Z = 1.14 to account for the resence of He].

(14)\nhe latter is usually 1, unless the mass-loss rate exceeds a few times 0 \u22122 M / yr , then GeV photons and beyond can be absorbed. In Type I-P SNe, we thus do not expect this process to affect substantially he gamma-ray flux.\nRESULTS A N D DISCUSSION\nhe model for the gamma-ray emission of a typical Type II-P CSN adopted here depends on a few physical parameters: the total xplosion energy E SN , the mass-loss rate of the pre\u2013SN wind M\u0307 w , he wind terminal velocity v w , the ejecta mass M ej and the radius f the progenitor star R . The influence of these parameters on the amma-ray signal is discussed next.\nRSG stars can have mass-loss rates from about 10 \u22128 to 10 \u22124 M r \u22121 (Mauron & Josselin 2011 ). Ho we ver, it had often been noted hat the progenitors of II-Ps appeared to arise from RSG stars hat were lower than about 20 M . This was first quantified by martt ( 2009 ) using optically identified SNe. Dwarkadas ( 2014 ) eached a similar conclusion using the X-ray light curves of SNe. larger data set allowed Smartt ( 2015 ) to consolidate their early rguments. In general, it appears that while RSG stars may have igher mass-loss rates, Type II-P SNe appear to arise from the lower nd of the RSG mass function. And since the mass-loss rates are irectly proportional to the RSG mass (Mauron & Josselin 2011 ), he II-Ps generally expand in a medium with lower mass-loss rates. herefore, we have assumed that II-P SNe expand in a medium ith mass-loss rates M\u0307 w = 10 \u22128 , 10 \u22127 , 10 \u22126 , and 10 \u22125 M yr \u22121 espectively. We discuss the possibility of higher mass loss rates n section 5.\nIn Figs 5 and 6 , we explore the parameter space and illustrate ur results. Fig. 5 also includes a comparison to prior results. For isplay purposes, we only show the gamma-ray fluxes obtained under he approximation of an homogeneous source (Wang et al. 2019 ) or flux es inte grated abo v e 100 GeV, where the difference is the reatest. We start by showing, for a fixed ejecta mass M ej = 4 M , he effect of various mass-loss rates. The total explosion energy s kept equal to E SN = 10 51 erg. As written in equation (10), the nabsorbed gamma-ray flux is expected to scale as M\u0307 2 w . Ho we ver, he scaling of the g amma-g amma opacity with the mass-loss rate s not straightforward. If r ph and T ph are not functions of M\u0307 w , R sh , t is scaling as \u221d M\u0307 \u22120 . 125 w (assuming n = 10). The integrated flux or photons of energy greater than 100 GeV and 1 TeV are shown. onsidering photons of energy greater than 500 GeV or 5 TeV lead o a gamma-ray signal of somewhat similar shape to the one abo v e TeV. The plots illustrate the importance of the g amma-g amma ttenuation at early time (in the first 10\u201320 d), as expected, when he photosphere and the shock are the closest, and the photosphere uminosity is the highest. The attenuation is potentially reaching 0 orders of magnitude, and the signal progressively returns to the nattenuated curve. Figs 5 and 6 also exhibit a second dip in the attenuation, at 10 \u221215 d, visible on all plots, and especially for the flux abo v e 00 GeV for the M\u0307 w = 10 \u22125 M yr \u22121 case (violet dotted line). This eature can be explained as follows.\nMNRAS 511, 3321\u20133329 (2022)\nFigure 6. Time evolution of the integrated photon flux abo v e 10 GeV (top), 100 GeV (middle), and 1 TeV (bottom). The source distance is D = 1 Mpc, the mass-loss rate of the RSG wind is M\u0307 w = 10 \u22126 M yr \u22121 . The results for an ejecta mass M ej = 2, 4, and 10 M are shown as dotted (blue), dashed (red), solid (green) for a progenitor radius R = 3 \u00d7 10 13 cm (thin) and R = 10 14 cm (thick) lines.

Let us for now only consider one\nNRAS 511, 3321\u20133329 (2022)\nphere emitting photons, for example the photosphere, of radius ph ( t ). To reach a point (P) located at a given distance h from the hotosphere, the first photons emitted at a time t 0 at which the hotosphere radius was R ph ( t 0 ) will travel during a time t 1 = h / c . t later time, more photons keep arriving at (P), emitted at different imes t 0 \u2217 (and travelling for shorter time t 1 \u2217) since the photosphere adius is expanding, and therefore, more photons emitted at various imes can reach the point (P). This results, in (P), in an increasing umber of photons (and thus an increasing luminosity from photons rom the photosphere) as \u03b1( t ) increases (see Fig. 4 ), until \u03b1 reaches maximum value \u03b1max ( t ) (corresponding to a photon emitted at the inimum t 0 ). Therefore, at any distance from the photosphere, the umber of photons is increasing until reaching a maximum value: he closer points see a quicker increase, and the farther points see a elayed and slower increase. We can try to estimate the typical distance up to which most of he photons from the photosphere are found at a given time t . Of ourse, emitted at t 0 , a photon can al w ays at most propagate up to c ( t\nt 0 ), but as just discussed, the time effect taking into account the elay of photons implies that the bulk of photons will only propagate o a shorter distance, that we name R ph, end , which is a function of ime. In order to estimate R ph, end at a time t , we can calculate the uminosity L ( i , t ) at different points i located at a distance h ( i ) from he photosphere:\nph , end ( t) \u2248 \u2211 \u221e\ni= 0 h ( i ) L ( i , t) \u2211 \u221e i= 0 L ( i, t)\n(15)\ne thus e v aluate R ph, end that way. For illustrative purposes, we plot n Fig. 7 R ph , R sh , and R ph, end for a given set of parameters: E SN = 0 51 erg, M ej = 5 M , M\u0307 = 10 \u22125 M yr \u22121 , and R = 10 14 cm. In rder to estimate the number of low energy photons that can interact ith gamma-rays, we can consider that the interacting photons are ocated in the volume V inter ( t) \u2248 4 \u03c0/ 3( R 3 ph , end ( t) \u2212 R 3 sh ( t)). This is, f course, a simplified view of the problem, but which illustrates that inter ( t ) is non-monotonic and peaking around \u223c10 d (see middle anel of Fig. 7 ). In this volume V inter ( t ), we can estimate the number f photons N inter ( , t ) \u2248 n ( , t ) V inter ( t ) (bottom panel of Fig. 7 ). his calculation illustrates that number of photons in V inter at energy eV close to the peak of interaction with TeV photons (Vassiliev 000 ) increases with time before sharply decreasing at \u223c10 d. For hotons of slightly different energy, the behaviour of N inter with time hanges radically: This illustrates, that the number of photons of given energy can increase after several \u223c10 d, and produce the econd attenuation dip present in various plots: Figs 5 , 6 , and 8 . he parameters adopted in Fig. 7 correspond exactly to the red thick ashed lines of Fig. 6 . Notice that in the case of SN 1993J (Cristofari t al. 2020b ), the shock and photosphere are sufficiently distant to nsure that R 3 ph , end \u2212 R 3 sh is monotonous, and the second dip is not isible. In Fig. 6 , we illustrate the effect of a change of temperature (and hus luminosity) of the photosphere by considering two different adii of the progenitor star R = 3 \u00d7 10 13 and 10 14 cm. The temporal volution of the temperature and luminosity is shown in Fig. 1 and he evolution of the black\u2013body distribution is illustrated in Fig. 2 . he resulting gamma-ray signal is shown in Fig. 6 , illustrating that he increased temperature and luminosity lead to an enhancement of he attenuation (visible for all ejecta mass considered). Moreo v er, he second attenuation dip featured at \u223c10 d discussed abo v e is\nore pronounced as the photosphere luminosity increases (i.e. as he energy available in the o v erlapping interaction volume V inter ncreases). In addition, the effect of the ejecta mass is shown, howing that increasing ejecta mass tends to lower the level of the\na o\nm m u e o r t r t w w e 5\n5\nW I a d t\ni b i\nttenuation (the effect is especially visible for higher temperatures f the photosphere). Recent works (see e.g. Barker et al. 2021 ) mentioned that for high ass-loss rates, the explosion energy of SNe arising from stars of ass 20 M can be less than 10 51 erg. Interestingly, it is possible to\nnderstand the effect of a lower total explosion energy by looking at quations (2), (3), and (8). The temperature is very weakly dependent n the total explosion energy E SN . The photospheric radius and shock adius scale with E SN in the same way \u221d E 0 . 41 SN . This dependency is herefore analogous to the dependency on the mass of the ejecta M ej : ph and R sh both roughly scale as \u221d M \u22120 . 25 ej , and thus is affecting he shock radius and photospheric in the same proportion. In other ords, for instance, the effect of decreasing E SN by a factor of 3, ould roughly decrease r ph and R sh by a factor \u2248(1/3) 0.41 \u2248 0.65, qui v alent to an increase of the ejecta mass by a factor \u22480.65 \u22121/0.25 \u2248 .6. The dependence of the absorption on E SN is illustrated in Fig. 8 .\nC O N C L U S I O N S\ne have estimated the gamma-ray signal emerging from typical Type I-P CCSNe in the first month after the SN explosion, taking into ccount non-isotropic time-dependent attenuation due to pair prouction. After a few tens of days the gamma-ray emission is similar o the unabsorbed solution. Our results can be summarized as follows.\nF or typical e xtrag alactic CCSNe, the g amma-ray signal, after nclusion of the two-photon annihilation process, is expected to e significantly lower than the typical sensitivity of Cherenkov nstruments for objects located at 1 Mpc. This indicates that mostly\nMNRAS 511, 3321\u20133329 (2022)\nn M i l l n n i r t d e c f a h p r\na m y a F l c w b l i a r s t s \u03c1 b R F b R \u03ba t \u03c3 1 t w s O T m m m r d h f t 2\nm\no s w w D t h w c & 2 b C t s a\nr S i d\na a ( e o c r c e g t t fi t d T G A\nA\nV a T ( r C a M\nD\nN\nR\nA A A B\nM\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/511/3/3321/6517473 by C N R S - ISTO user on 07 April 2023\nearby Type II-P SNe, typically exploding in our Galaxy or in the agellanic Clouds, are expected to be detectable by next generation nstruments, such as CTA, although a detailed calculation using the ast CTA sensitivity is necessary before providing a more precise imit. Type II-P SNe make up the major fraction of CCSNe. It is worth oting at this stage that our calculation of the pair production does ot account for the possibility to produce saturated pair cascades, .e. to produce several generations of electron\u2013positron pairs in the adiation field produced by the previous generation. Together with he possibility of gamma-ray emission at the reverse shock, these ifferent generation of pairs can add up some gamma-ray emission, specially in the GeV range. So our calculation has to be seen as onserv ati ve. The pair cascade process issue will be addressed in a uture work. Finally, Type II-P SNe are generally interacting with relatively diluted medium. A study of SN types that evolve in a igher-density medium (such as some Type IIb and IIn SNe) will robably greatly impro v e chances of detection in the gamma-ray ange.\nSeveral authors have found that, in order to fit the initial rise nd the peak of the optical light curves of Type II-P SNe, they ust hav e e xperienced a v ery high mass-loss rate of up to 1 M r \u22121 in the very last few years before the star collapsed to become SN (Morozova, Piro & Valenti 2017 , 2018 ; Yaron et al. 2017 ;  \u0308orster et al. 2018 ; Ricks & Dwarkadas 2019 ). These high massoss rates in many cases occur in only the last 2\u20133 yr before coreollapse. If we assume that they are due to RSG winds with a ind velocity of typically 10 km s \u22121 , then the SN shock would e expected to cross this high-density region within a few days or 10 d, depending on the progenitor activity. This enhanced massoss rate could delay the onset of particle acceleration if the wind s optically thick. Indeed, particle acceleration is expected to start round SN shock breakout at an optical depth \u03c4 \u2248 c / v sh , when the adiation-mediated shock stalls and is replaced with a collisionless hock. In the case of an optically thick wind, this would occur in he wind at a radius R br > R , rather than at the surface of the tar. Assuming a spherical wind with opacity \u03ba , and with density ( r) = M\u0307 w / (4 \u03c0v w r 2 ) between r = R and r = R w and negligible eyond, the optical depth is \u03c4 ( r) = \u03ba \u222b R w\nr \u03c1d r , and R br then satisfies:\n\u22121 br \u2248 R \u22121 w + 4 \u03c0cv w /\u03baM\u0307 w v s (see also Che v alier & Irwin 2011 ). or large mass-loss rates, such that R w < \u03baM\u0307 w v s / 4 \u03c0cv w , the shock reakout and the onset of particle acceleration would occur at br \u2248 R w . For more moderate mass-loss rates, such that R w > M\u0307 w v s / 4 \u03c0cv w , this would occur at R br \u2248 \u03baM\u0307 w v s / 4 \u03c0cv w . Assuming hat \u03ba is dominated by Thomson scattering, i.e. \u03ba = \u03c3 t / m p where t is the Thomson cross-section, one finds: R br \u2248 10 14 cm ( M\u0307 w / 5 \u00b7 0 \u22124 M yr \u22121 )( v sh / 0 . 1 c)( v w / 10 km s \u22121 ) \u22121 . If the wind is optically hick, R br > R , and particle acceleration can start at r R br hen conditions are fa v ourable, see Giacinti & Bell ( 2015 ) for pecific cases where particle acceleration could start at r < R br . n the contrary, if R br < R , the wind is, in fact, optically thin: he shock breakout occurs at R br = R , and particle acceleration ay start at r R . In case the particle acceleration onset is not uch delayed, enhanced mass-loss rates should conversely lead to ore efficient particle acceleration and possibly enhanced gammaay emission. In effect, higher M\u0307 /v w ratios produce higher CRriven instability growth rates (Marcowith et al. 2018 ). Ultimately, igher magnetic field strengths should be obtained at the shock ront. This should produce higher CR energies eventually reaching he CR knee within a week after the shock breakout (Inoue et al. 021 ). SN 1987A, the closest SNe to us in o v er 300 yr, deserv es special ention here. Sometimes this is considered similar to the II-P SNe,\nNRAS 511, 3321\u20133329 (2022)\nr treated as Type II peculiar . Ho we ver, its progenitor was a blue upergiant, not an RSG (McCray & Fransson 2016 ). The SN shock a ve initially ev olved in a very low density blue supergiant wind ith a mass-loss rate M\u0307 \u223c 10 \u22129 \u2212 10 \u22128 M yr \u22121 (Che v alier & warkadas 1995 ; Lundqvist 1999 ; Dewey et al. 2012 ), lower than he SNe considered herein. After a few years, the SN interacted with igher density circumstellar material formed by the blue supergiant ind sweeping up the RSG wind from a prior epoch. This interaction ould lead to a potentially significant gamma-ray signal (Duffy, Ball Kirk 1995 ; Berezhko, Ksenofontov & V \u0308olk 2011 ; Dwarkadas 013 ; Berezhko, Ksenofontov & V \u0308olk 2015 ). It has not been detected y current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (H. E. S. S. ollaboration 2015 ), but will be a target for the upcoming CTA. The reatment herein is not applicable to SN 1987A, since the complicated tructure of the surrounding medium does not make it amenable to n analytic treatment.\nLet us ho we ver note that a typical Type II-P SN with a mass-loss ate 10 \u22126 M yr \u22121 , located at a distance comparable to the one of N1987A ( \u223c51 kpc) would a priori be detectable by next generation nstruments such as CTA, this can be seen by rescaling with the istance results of Fig. 6 . The simple parametrization adopted here, for the shock evolution, nd photospheric e volution, allo ws to study the g amma-g amma bsorption and discuss the importance of the physical parameters mass of the ejecta, mass-loss rate of the RSG wind in which the SN xplodes, temperature of the photosphere, total explosion energy, pacity, radius of the exploding star). We especially illustrate how hanges by a factor of \u223c2 \u2212 3 on some parameters (e.g. the stellar adius, and thus on the expected temperature) can lead to dramatic hanges in the level of absorption. The time-integration of absorption ffects can in some situations lead to detectable features in the amma-ray signal, such as when the shock radius evolves very close o the photosphere (e.g. M\u0307 w \u223c 10 \u22125 M yr \u22121 ). Finally, we illustrate hat the largest gamma-ray fluxes from Type II-P CCSNe in the rst days after the SN explosion, are expected when M\u0307 w , M ej are he highest, E SN , and R are the smallest, and could potentially be etected by next generation instruments, such as CTA (Cherenkov elescope Array Consortium et al. 2019 ), the Southern Wide-field amma-ray Observatory (Albert et al. 2019 ), or the Large High ltitude Air Shower Observatory (Bai et al. 2019 ).\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nVD is supported by National Science Foundation grant 1911061 warded to the University of Chicago (PI: Vikram Dwarkadas). he research activity of EP was supported by Villum Fonden project number 18994) and by the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 esearch and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowskaurie grant agreement number 847523 \u2018INTERACTIONS\u2019.
