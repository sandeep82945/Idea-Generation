    "abstractText": "The developing flexible ultrathin glass for use in foldable displays has attracted widespread attention as an alternative to rigid electronic smartphones. However, the detailed compositional effects of chemically strengthened glass are not well understood. Moreover, the spatially resolved chemistry and depth of the compression layer of tempered glass are far from clear. In this study, commonly used X-ray spectroscopy techniques and atom probe tomography (APT) were used comparatively to investigate the distribution of constituent elements in two representative smartphone glass samples: nonand chemically tempered. APT has enabled sub-nanoscale analyses of alkali metals (Li, Na, K, and Ca) and this demonstrates that APT can be considered as an alternative technique for imaging the chemical distribution in glass for mobile applications.",

            "text": "Chemical strengthening of glass was initially proposed by Kistler (1962). This process involved replacing one of the constituents with an element of different atomic size and electronic polarizability while maintaining the structure of the pristine glass. Since then, extensive research and industrial efforts have been carried out to develop this approach for the mechanical strengthening of glass in a wide range of applications, including aircraft cockpits, digital dashboards, and passenger seat displays in automobiles, and hard disk drives for data storage (Gy, 2008). Most importantly, it is perceived as the best fabrication method to effectively strengthen ultrathin glass (UTG) sheets without influencing their optical properties and mass (Yuan et al., 2021). With a thickness below 100 \u03bcm, UTG is an increasingly popular display material that can be folded or rolled like a flexible polymer while protecting the screen (Tanaka, 2013). There are many promising applications for UTG ranging from wearable devices to solar cells and even flexible smartphones (SCHOTT, 2021). A recently available commercial flip phone already uses UTG with a thickness of 30 \u03bcm on its rigid display (SamsungDisplay, 2020). Moreover, UTGs with a thickness of \u223c5 \u03bcm have demonstrated good flexibility in micro-scale applications such as femtoliter nanofluidic valves (Kazoe et al., 2019) and diaphragm pressure transducers (Yalikun & Tanaka, 2017).\nThe manufacture of UTG usually involves the replacement of small ions (e.g., Na+) by larger ones from an external ion source (e.g., K+). It creates a compressive stress at the surface that improves mechanical strength, preventing the possible formation of micro/nano-cracks on the glass surface (Nordberg et al., 1964). However, if the ion-exchange process continues for a bulk glass, the surface compressive stress will increase,\nwhile the tensile stress inside the glass will rapidly increase. Additionally, a complete diffusion throughout the thickness could create severe internal-compressive stress, resulting in failure of the material (Shan et al., 2018; Terakado et al., 2020). Therefore, the depth of the ion-diffused layer (DOL), which is defined as the depth at which the residual stress is equal to zero, must be measured to ensure high-quality chemically strengthened glass. Generally, the DOL limitation for UTG is considered to be one-sixth of the glass thickness; hence, 830 nm would be the threshold depth for a 5-\u03bcm-thick UTG.\nWhile the kinetics of the alkali ion interdiffusion process and chemical strengthening are well reported, the underlying atomic-scale compositional effect is less well understood, especially for UTG (Varshneya, 2010). This is due to the limitations of in-depth chemical characterization instruments that offer site-specific analyses. Accordingly, most research still relies on spectroscopy techniques or the nominal weight compositions from powder-melting synthesis (Farah et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2021). Herein, we assess the performance of atom probe tomography (APT; Gault et al., 2021) in a systematic comparison with more conventional chemical analysis tools on an aluminosilicate tempered glass and correlate it with increases in glass hardness. We also discuss the strength and weaknesses of these selected techniques and demonstrate the complementarity offered by APT that provides spatially resolved distribution of alkali-(earth) elements at the subnanometer level, including light and trace elements."

Here,\nthe dissolved liquid glass is heated with plasma emitting light which is then measured with the spectrometry. After the exchange process, an increase in K content was observed. However, the overestimation of the Na content after the exchange disagreed with the expected result (Fig. 3a, Table 1). A possible explanation for this could be the introduction of Na during the preparation of the specimens. Each glass display was crushed into a powder with a mortar and pestle, followed by dissolution with hydrofluoric acid. Moreover, the mortar and pestle constituent element (e.g., Zr) was also detected implying the possible introduction of impurities during sample preparation, although this was not detected when using the other analytical techniques.\nThe SEM-EDS elemental analysis is commonly employed for analyzing the chemical composition of glass (Erdem et al.,\nFig. 2.

With SEM-EDS, a depth resolution of \u223c2 \u03bcm is possible, which is typically sufficient for near-surface chemistry analysis (EDAX, 2020). Figure 4 displays the surface SEM images and EDS spectra of Glass_0 and Glass_1. The atomic fraction of the detected trace elements (Na, P, and K) is plotted in Figure 3b. The decrease in Na after the ion-exchange process indicated that Na was replaced by K in the analyzed region. However, no information regarding other elements (Li and Ca) was obtained due to the elemental detection limit for the trace amount (<0.5 wt%), particularly for light elements (Leng, 2013). Unfortunately, this representative result might not provide sufficient details for advancing our understanding of the chemical-exchange effect."

            "text": "We performed APT to evaluate the composition and distributions of elements in both samples. Moreover, three APT measurements were performed on each sample and we obtained total counts of 41.2 and 53.7 M ions before and after chemically tempering the samples, respectively. These were then used for the chemical compositional analysis. Unlike X-ray-based spectroscopy or other bulk-mass spectrometry techniques, APT does not require corrections by relative sensitivity factors, which can vary by orders of magnitude depending on the considered element. Moreover, despite the known issues when detecting substances [e.g., oxygen (Saxey, 2011; Gault et al., 2016; Zanuttini et al., 2017) and alkalis (Greiwe et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2017)] in oxides, APT has the potential to provide local analysis with chemical sensitivity in combination with a subnanometer spatial resolution for detecting local deviations in composition (Gin et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2017).\nTypically, different acquisition parameters (e.g., base temperature and laser-pulse energy) can affect APT performance, including background levels and eventually mass and spatial resolutions. Particularly, in the case of poor- or non-conductive materials (such as glass), the measurement parameters require careful optimization (see Fig. 5). The laser parameters were swept every 2.5 million ions for the glass specimens. In general, pulsing at a low laser repetition rate requires relatively more time to collect a sufficient number of ions to ensure statistically relevant analyses, whereas field evaporation at high laser-pulse energy often results in the development of thermal tails. Accordingly, 125 kHz and 90 pJ were selected as the optimal parameter conditions in the LEAP 5000XR system.\nExamples of mass spectra obtained from both instruments are shown in Figures 6a and 6b. The former exhibited a detection\nefficiency of \u223c80%, compared with the latter with only \u223c50%. In contrast, the XR system achieved a higher mass resolution, as the reflectron enabled longer flight times, resulting in better separation of the mass peaks. For instance, in the XR system, a clear peak at 15.5 Da corresponding to 31P2+ ion was detected with the full width half maximum of 0.05244 (insets in Fig. 6). In comparison, the FWHW of the 31P2+ peak in the XS system was 0.15732, which was three times higher than that of the XR system. No significant difference in overall atomic composition was revealed between the two instruments (Table 1). However, a noticeable peak at 15.66 Da in the HR system (corresponding to PO3+) was detected, which was not observed in the XS mass spectra. Therefore, for a more accurate analysis, we used the HR system for detailed chemical analysis of the acquired mass spectrum.\nAs mentioned previously, quantification by APT for a ceramic sample is challenging. The data set from Glass_2 in the LEAP 5000 XS was further analyzed to investigate the multiplicity of the detected ions to determine whether additional chemical information could be retrieved from the otherwise un-identified ions. In Figure 7a, the correlation histogram of the multiple-ion events demonstrates that there was continuous field evaporation of complex oxygen-containing molecular ions caused by the electrostatic field. In other words, this was not triggered by the temperature increase associated with the laser pulse (which can be considered DC evaporation) or by the very long delay following the thermal pulse. These ions were the main contributors to the high background levels. From the origin, there were parabolic trails that indicated ion evaporation was induced by a standing DC field without the absence of pulsing (Saxey, 2011). Moreover, despite the strong and clearly discernible peaks throughout the mass-to-charge spectrum of the tempered state, the background still represents a large portion (30%). In addition, the single (M = 1) spectrum had a slightly different distribution to the multiple (M > 1) spectrum (Fig. 7b). This difference could be attributed to a distinct component corresponding to a higher fraction of DC evaporation events. This phenomenon was discussed previously by Yao et al. (2010, 2013). Nevertheless, our interest was primarily in the detection of alkali ion species that do not seem to be affected as much compared with Al, Si, and mostly O ions. This could be related to their high electropositivity, which renders them less prone to forming molecular ions under intense positive electric fields.\nFigure 8 displays the overall reconstructed 3D atom maps of Glass_0 (up) and Glass_1 (down).

The mass spectrum in Figure 6c can be referenced for the element species. All the elements were visually homogeneously distributed and no enrichment or depletion are observed. To investigate the chemistry and structure further, the inner regions of the atom maps were extracted as shown in Figure 9a: Glass_0 (right) and Glass_1 (left).\nAfter the ion exchange, different content levels of alkali elements such as Li, Na, and K were detected in the Glass_1 sample. The distributions of the alkali ions were assessed by using a nearest-neighbor analysis, and they appeared comparable with random distribution (Stephenson et al., 2007; Shariq et al., 2012) (Figs. 9b, 9c). For a quantitative assessment of the randomness analysis, the Pearson coefficient (\u00b5) was measured for each alkali element. Here, all the coefficients are near-zero values (\u00b5Li = 0.0132, \u00b5Na = 0.0983, \u00b5K = 0.103) suggesting that the alkali ions were randomly distributed in the glass. The levels of Li+ and Na+ decreased by factors of 2.5 and 1.6, respectively, whereas the content of K+ increased by up to 1.7 at%. Interestingly, the reduction in Li+ concentration was larger than for Na+. This can be simply explained by the higher diffusivity with respect to ion radii: Li+ has the smallest\nsize of 78 p.m., whereas Na+ and K+ have the size of 98 and 133 p.m., respectively. The Li+\u2013K+ ion replacement would have a greater size mismatch; hence, a greater compressive stress was formed compared with the Na+\u2013K+ exchange.\nFor the Li-doped amorphous silicate, Li electromigration was observed and Li ions continuously moved toward the specimen apex during the field evaporation process (Greiwe et al., 2014). In contrast, despite the long measurements (>5 M ions) in the aluminosilicate glass, no migration of Li or other elements was observed (see Figs. 8, 9c). This phenomenon could be due to difference in Li-ion transport characteristics between the amorphous and glass structures and thermal interaction between the laser and the specimen. The atomic ratio of Si to Al for both types of glass was \u223c2, indicating that the molecular ratio of Al2O3 to SiO2 compounds was 1:1. This agrees with the 1:1 ratio of Al2O3 and SiO2 that was measured with other analytical instruments, as summarized in Figure 10a.\nIn addition, P and Ca were also detected, with 1.85 at% and 230 appm, respectively, in Glass_1.

Moreover, alumina generally plays an important role in ion exchange, since it provides a strong network and acts as a charge balancer. The structure of aluminum ions depends on the glass composition (Yan et al., 1996). For example, when the alkali-oxide (e.g., Na2-O) content is higher than alumina, all alumina is found in tetrahedral coordination with compensating the alkali ions charges. In constrast, when the alumina content is higher, alkali-oxide changes to an s divalent Na-O structure varying the degree of tetrahedral aluminum. As a result, depending on the alkali element content in the glass, this results in the formation of five- and sixfold coordinated aluminum ions (Xiang et al., 2013), while retaining its\nglass network.

Herein, we demonstrate the importance of using accurate chemical analysis on a commercial glass before and after strengthening by ion exchange. As presented in the summarized schematic diagram (Fig. 10c), Li+ and Na+ diffused from the glass to the KNO3 bath, where K+ and impurity Ca2+ diffused into the surface."

            "text": "In this paper, we reported on a comparative study of spectroscopy and APT in the atomic-scale mapping of alkali ions in non- and ion-exchanged glass. We demonstrated that APT is superior to commonly used spectroscopy techniques in terms of both spatial resolution and quantification. In addition, direct-flight and reflectron-flight atom probe systems were compared and no significant difference was observed in terms of composition. In UTG technology, it is very important to quantify and image the exchanged alkali ions to simultaneously increase hardness and flexibility. Therefore, site-specific mass spectrometry techniques (such as APT) are required to understand the direct relationship between the chemistry and the mechanical properties of such types of glass."
